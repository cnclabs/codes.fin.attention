wentz  phd we develop and manufacture high quality  science based nutritional and personal care products with a primary focus on promoting long term health and reducing the risk of chronic degenerative disease 
in so doing  we are committed to continuous product innovation and sound scientific research 
we have operations in markets worldwide where we distribute and sell our products by way of direct selling 
our net sales in fiscal year were million  of which were in markets outside of the united states 
as a us based multi national company with an expanding international presence  our operating results are becoming more sensitive to currency fluctuations  as well as economic and political conditions in markets throughout the world 
additionally  we are subject to the various laws and regulations unique both to the products that we sell and to our method of distribution 
our customer base comprises two types of customers associates and preferred customers 
associates are independent distributors of our products  who also purchase our products for personal use 
preferred customers purchase our products strictly for personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products 
as of december   we had  active associates and  active preferred customers worldwide 
recent developments in  we increased our international expansion efforts by announcing and preparing for our entry into thailand  france  and belgium 
we expect our operations in france and belgium to begin at the end of the first quarter of  and we expect our operations in thailand to have fully commenced by the middle of the second quarter of thailand and france are among the top direct selling markets in the world  and we are encouraged by the growth opportunity that these markets provide 
further  we believe the opening of france and belgium will provide our north american associates additional opportunity to expand their business internationally 
this is particularly true for many of our canadian associates who have direct ties to france 
we continued integrating our china subsidiary  babycare  into our business during we introduced several usana products for sale in china and continued educating our associates on our china compensation plan to help them understand how to appropriately grow their businesses in china 
additionally  we continued to make progress on obtaining additional provincial direct selling licenses 
in  we also began implementing a strategy to stabilize and grow our north america region 
this strategy is centered on a number of key initiatives  including i strengthening the partnership between usana and its north american associates  ii developing the leadership and marketing 
table of contents skills of our associates  iii personalizing our products  technologies and systems to meet the individual needs of our associates  iv innovating to develop new products and technologies  and v offering north america specific incentives and promotions 
to develop and support these initiatives  we have expanded our corporate and management team 
while this is a long term strategy that will require upfront investment and patience  we believe that our successful execution of this strategy could produce results as early as the fourth quarter of additionally  we believe our entry into the france and belgium markets will encourage north american associates to expand their businesses

myhealthpak is a fully customized pre packaged supplement regimen  similar to the healthpak and can include virtually any of the essentials and optimizers 
additionally  myhealthpak is currently only available to our customers in the united states and as part of our personalization and innovation initiative we will look for opportunities to expand this offering into other of our markets 
the approximate percentage of total product sales represented by our top selling products for the last three fiscal years are as follows year ended top selling products usana essentials proflavanol healthpak geographic presence our products are distributed and sold in markets 
we have organized our markets into two geographic regions north america and asia pacific  with three sub regions under asia pacific 
north america north america is our most mature region and includes the united states including direct sales from the united states to the united kingdom and the netherlands  canada  and mexico 
the most recent market expansion in this region was our entry into mexico in for several years  north america has been our most challenging region 
our north america growth strategy  which is discussed elsewhere in this report  is intended to reverse our declining trend in north america and generate growth 
we note that north america will become our north america europe region with the opening of business in france and belgium in asia pacific asia pacific is organized into three sub regions southeast asia pacific  greater china  and north asia 
markets included in each of these sub regions are as follows southeast asia pacific australia  new zealand  singapore  malaysia  and the philippines greater china hong kong  taiwan  and china north asia japan and south korea our business in china is that of babycare  our wholly owned subsidiary 

table of contents growth in our asia pacific region over the last several years has been led by our hong kong market 
our most recent market expansions in this region include our entry into the philippines in and our entry into mainland china in through our acquisition of babycare 
these two markets have contributed to our recent growth in this region 
moving forward we anticipate growth in this region to come from emerging markets such as the philippines  south korea  china  and thailand 
our thailand market will be included in southeast asia pacific 
net sales by region the following table shows net sales by geographic region for our last three fiscal years 
we report net sales in a geographic region if a product shipment originates in that geographic region 
additional financial information relating to our geographic regions can be found in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
years ended region in thousands north america united states canada mexico asia pacific southeast asia pacific greater china north asia research and development our research and development efforts are focused on developing and providing high quality  science based products that promote long term health and reduce the risk of chronic degenerative disease 
our research and development activities include developing products that are new to usana and new to the industry  updating existing formulas to keep them current with the latest science  and adapting existing formulas to meet ever changing regulations in new and existing international markets 
our scientific staff includes experts on human nutrition  cellular biology  biochemistry  natural product chemistry  and clinical research 
these experts continually review the latest published research on nutrition  attend scientific conferences  and work with a number of third party research institutions and researchers to identify possible new products and opportunities to reformulate our existing products 
in  we continued our relationship with the linus pauling institute lpi at oregon state university 
our goal is to better determine and understand the function and role of micronutrients such as vitamins  minerals  and antioxidants in promoting optimal health and preventing disease 
as part of this relationship  our in house research team works closely with lpi on nutritional and clinical research 
in  we plan to continue our research efforts with lpi and maintain our ongoing nutrition research in preventing oxidative stress  glycemic stress  and chronic inflammation 
our goal is to maintain a sharp focus on nutrition both inside and outside the body in promoting health and preventing chronic degenerative disease 
because we believe in focusing primarily on key health issues within our society rather than on fads  we typically do not introduce a new product 
table of contents unless we believe that it can provide health benefits to a significant number of our customers 
as a result  we maintain a focused and compact line of products  which we believe simplifies the selling and buying process for our associates and preferred customers 
we follow pharmaceutical standards established by the us pharmacopeia and other pharmacopeias in the development and formulation of our products 
our ingredients are selected to meet a number of criteria  including  but not limited to safety  potency  purity  stability  bio availability  and natural versus synthetic 
we control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage  and we maintain our quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients  manufacturing  packaging  and labeling 
in fiscal years   and  we expended million  million  and million  respectively  on product research and development activities 
we intend to continue dedicating resources at similar levels for research and development in future years 
manufacturing and quality assurance we conduct nearly all of the manufacturing  production and quality control operations for our nutritional and personal care products in house 
we have established and maintain a manufacturing and quality control facility in salt lake city  utah 
babycare manufactures and produces nearly all of its products in house and maintains manufacturing and quality control facilities in beijing  china and tianjin  china 
additional information about our us manufacturing  production and quality control operations is set out below 
tablet manufacturing tablet manufacturing is conducted at our salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility 
our tablet production process uses automatic and semi automatic equipment and includes the following activities identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  forming mixtures into tablets  coating and sorting the tablets  analyzing tablet quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
we conduct sample testing of raw materials  in process materials  and finished products for purity  potency  and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications  and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests 
we employ a qualified staff of professionals to develop  implement and maintain a quality system designed to assure that our products are manufactured to our internal and applicable regulatory agency specifications 
our salt lake city manufacturing facility is registered with the us food and drug administration fda  health canada natural health products directorate  the australian therapeutic goods administration tga  and other governmental agencies  as required 
this facility is audited regularly by various organizations and government agencies to assess  among other things  compliance with good manufacturing practice regulations gmps and with labeling claims 
based on these audits  our salt lake city manufacturing facility has received and maintains certifications from the islamic foods and nutrition counsel of america in compliance with halal  nsf international in compliance with product testing and gmps  and the tga in compliance with the therapeutic goods act of the manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the united states requires compliance with dietary supplement gmps  which are based on the food model gmps  with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements 
we believe our manufacturing processes comply with the gmps for dietary supplements 

table of contents personal care manufacturing historically  we have manufactured the majority of our personal care products at our draper  utah manufacturing facility 
in  we moved the manufacturing of our personal care products to our salt lake city facility to maximize efficiency and reduce costs on these items 
the production process for personal care products includes identifying and evaluating suppliers of raw materials  acquiring raw materials  analyzing raw material quality  weighing or otherwise measuring the raw materials  mixing raw materials into batches  analyzing liquid batch quality  packaging finished products  and analyzing finished product quality 
we conduct sample testing of raw materials  in process materials  and finished products for purity  potency  and composition to determine whether our products conform to our internal specifications  and we maintain complete documentation for each of these tests 
at our salt lake city facility  we have standard technology for producing batches of personal care items  and we have semi automatic packaging equipment for packaging end products 
we employ qualified staff to develop  implement  and maintain a quality system 
although the fda has not promulgated gmps for personal care items  it has issued guidelines for manufacturing personal care products 
we voluntarily maintain compliance with the guidance established by fda and the personal care products council 
third party suppliers and manufacturers we contract with third party suppliers and manufacturers for the production of some of our products  which account for approximately of our product sales 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations that have been developed by  or in conjunction with  our in house product development team 
these products include most of our gelatin capsulated supplements  rev energy drink  probiotic  our powdered drink mixes and nutrition bars  and certain of our personal care products 
products manufactured at these locations must also go through quality control and assurance procedures to ensure they are manufactured in conformance with our specifications 
quality control assurance we conduct quality control processes in two in house laboratories that are located in salt lake city  utah 
in our microbiology laboratory  scientists test for biological contamination of raw materials and finished goods 
in our analytical chemistry laboratory  scientists test for chemical contamination and accurate levels of active ingredients in both raw materials and finished products 
both laboratories conduct stability tests on finished products to determine the shelf life of our products 
our laboratory staff also performs chemical assays on vitamin and mineral constituents  using united states pharmacopoeia methods and other internally validated methods 
in addition to our quality control and clinical laboratories  our headquarters facility also houses a laboratory designated for research and development 
we also perform processes similar to those described above at our labs in china 
raw materials most of the raw ingredients that are used in the manufacture of our products are available from a number of suppliers 
we have not generally experienced difficulty in obtaining necessary quantities of raw ingredients 
when supplies of certain raw materials have tightened  we have been able to find alternative sources of raw materials  and believe we will be able to do so in the future  if the need arises 
accordingly  we are not subject to a single source supplier for our required supplies of raw ingredients 
our raw material suppliers must demonstrate stringent process and quality control before we use their products in our manufacturing process 

table of contents distribution and marketing general we distribute our products internationally through a network marketing system  which is a form of person to person direct selling 
under this system  distributors purchase products at wholesale prices from the manufacturer for resale to consumers and for personal consumption 
the concept of network marketing is based on the strength of personal recommendations that frequently come from friends  neighbors  relatives  and close acquaintances 
we believe that network marketing is an effective way to distribute our products because it allows person to person product education and testimonials as well as higher levels of customer service  all of which are not as readily available through other distribution channels 
structure of network marketing program associates 
a person who wishes to sell usana products must join our independent sales force as an associate 
a person becomes an associate by completing an application under the sponsorship of an existing associate 
the new associate then becomes part of the sponsoring associate s down line sales organization 
new associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to the usana policies and procedures 
under the policies and procedures  associates may not  among other things i use deceptive or unlawful practices to sell usana products  ii make deceptive or unlawful claims or representations concerning our products or compensation plan  or iii sell competitive products to other usana associates or solicit usana associates to participate in other network marketing opportunities 
new associates are required to purchase a starter kit that includes a detailed manual describing our business and products as well as our policies and procedures 
we sell these kits at a nominal cost averaging in each of our markets 
no other investment is required to become an associate and start a home based business with usana 
once a person becomes an associate  he or she is able to purchase products directly from us at wholesale prices for personal use and resale to customers 
our associates are also entitled to build sales organizations by attracting and enrolling new associates and establishing a network of product users 
the sponsoring of new associates results in the creation of multiple levels within our network marketing structure 
sponsored associates are referred to as part of the down line of the sponsoring associate 
down line associates may also sponsor new associates  creating additional levels in their network  but also forming a part of the same down line as the original sponsoring associate 
as outlined below  associates who are interested in earning additional income must successfully sell usana products and establish a business network down line in order to qualify for commissions  including bonuses 
subject to payment of a minimal annual account renewal fee  associates may continue to distribute or consume our products as long as they adhere to our policies and procedures 
individuals who reside in china and who are interested in being part of usana s organization in china may do so by joining babycare as an associate 
the process for joining babycare is very similar to the process for joining usana and requires an initial associate application and an agreement by the associate to adhere to the policies and procedures in china 
much like our operations in other markets  an associate in china is provided with opportunities to build a sales organization and receive compensation for sales generated by that organization 
associates in china do not participate in usana s compensation plan and  therefore  are compensated under the plan created and implemented specifically for china 
preferred customers 
we also sell directly to customers who purchase products only for personal use 
this program is our preferred customer program 
preferred customers may not resell or distribute our products 
we believe this program gives us access to a market that would otherwise be missed  by targeting customers who enjoy usana products  but who prefer not to maintain a distribution relationship with us 
although our policies prohibit preferred customers from engaging in 
table of contents retail sales of products  they may enroll as associates at any time  if they desire 
preferred customers are not eligible to earn commissions or to participate in our compensation plan 
our china operations also utilize a preferred customer program  which is similar to usana s preferred customer program in other markets 
associate training and motivation initial training of associates about the products  the compensation plan  network marketing  and about usana is provided primarily by an associate s sponsor and others in their sales organization 
we develop and sell training materials and sales tools to assist associates in building their businesses  as well as provide reprints from other commercial publications that feature usana and may be used as sales tools 
we also sponsor and conduct regional  national  and international associate events  as well as intensive leadership training seminars 
attendance at these sessions is voluntary  and we undertake no generalized effort to provide individualized training to associates  although experience shows that the most effective and successful associates participate in training activities 
although we provide leadership training and sales tools  we ultimately rely on our associates to sell our products  attract new associates and preferred customers to purchase our products  and educate and train new associates regarding our products and compensation plan 
associate compensation as outlined below  our compensation plan provides several opportunities for associates to earn compensation  provided they are willing to consistently work at building  training  and retaining their down line organizations to sell usana products to consumers 
the purpose behind each form of compensation under our compensation plan is to reward associates for generating product sales either directly or indirectly through their down line sales organization and network of product consumers 
we believe our compensation plan is among the most generous in the network marketing industry and distinctive for its weekly payouts to associates 
associates can earn compensation in four ways commissions 
the primary way an associate is compensated is through earning commissions 
associates earn commissions through generating sales volume points  which are a measure of the product sales of their down line sales organization 
sales volume points are assigned to each of our products and comprise a certain percent of the product price in us dollars 
to be eligible to earn commissions  an associate must purchase a certain amount of product each month qualifying purchases  which they may resell to consumers or use personally 
associates do not earn commissions on these qualifying purchases 
associates only earn commissions on the purchase of products by associates in their down line organization and preferred customers 
additionally  associates do not earn commissions for simply recruiting and enrolling others in their down line organization 
commissions are paid only when products are sold 
we pay associate commissions on a weekly basis 
as noted elsewhere in this report  our china operations maintain their own compensation plan  which is structured differently than usana s plan in other markets 
bonuses 
we offer associates several bonus opportunities  including our leadership bonus  elite bonus  and matching bonus 
these bonus opportunities are based on a pay for performance philosophy and  therefore  are paid out when the associate achieves the required performance measures 
retail mark ups 
as discussed previously  our associates purchase products from us at wholesale prices and resell them to consumers at higher retail prices 
the associate retains the retail mark up as another form of compensation 

table of contents contests and promotions 
we periodically sponsor contests and promotions designed to incentivize associates to generate sales and grow their down line organization and product users 
these promotions are also based on a pay for performance philosophy and  therefore  are only paid upon the achievement of the promotion objectives 
we endeavor to integrate our compensation plan seamlessly across all markets where legally permissible  allowing associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
this seamless down line structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by establishing or expanding their down line in any of the markets where we operate 
we believe our compensation plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to continue to integrate new markets into our compensation plan 
as a result of the direct selling laws in china  our associates in that market do not participate in usana s compensation plan 
instead  they are compensated under a plan that has been created and implemented specifically for china 
operating strengths our principal objective is to be a leading developer  manufacturer and distributor of science based nutritional and personal care products and to create a rewarding opportunity through network marketing for our associates who distribute our products 
our strategy is to capitalize on our operating strengths  which include a strong research and development program  in house manufacturing capability  science based products  an attractive associate compensation plan  a scalable business model  and an experienced management team 
emphasis on research and development 
we have a technical team of experienced scientists  including several holding phd degrees  quality engineers  and regulatory specialists who contribute to our research and development activities 
in our research and development laboratories  our scientists and researchers investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings  identify and research combinations of nutrients that may be candidates for new products  develop new nutritional ingredients for use in supplements  study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified nutritional ingredients  enhance existing products  as new discoveries in nutrition and skin care are made  and formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of our markets 
our scientists and researchers also conduct double blind  placebo controlled  clinical studies which are intended to further evaluate the efficacy of our products 
in addition  we work with outside research organizations to further support various aspects of our research and development efforts 
one of these organizations is the linus pauling institute at oregon state university 
our work with the linus pauling institute advances the science of human nutrition and health  provides us with valuable information to formulate and upgrade our nutritional products  and allows us to better advise our customers on how to use usana products 
we have also funded clinical research programs at boston university  the university of colorado  the university of utah  sydney university in australia  the orthopedic specialty hospital tosh and utah state university 
additionally  our scientific advisory council  comprised of health care professionals and nutritional science experts worldwide  provides us with valuable insights into product applications and efficacy 
it is through our internal research and development efforts and our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers that we can provide what we believe to be some of the highest quality health products in the industry 

table of contents in house manufacturing 
we manufacture products that account for approximately of our product sales 
we believe that our ability to manufacture our own products in house is a significant competitive advantage for the following reasons we can better control the quality of raw materials and finished products  we can more reliably monitor the manufacturing process to better guarantee potency and bioavailability and to reduce the risk of product contamination  we can better control production schedules to increase the likelihood of maintaining an uninterrupted supply of products for our customers  we are able to produce most of our own prototypes in the research phase of product development  and we are better able to manage the underlying costs associated with manufacturing our products 
science based products 
as a result of our emphasis on research and development and our in house manufacturing capabilities  we have developed a focused line of high quality health products that we believe provides health benefits to our customers 
our products have been developed based on a combination of published research  in house laboratory and third party clinical studies  and sponsored research 
additionally  we design  manufacture  package  and label our products in a manner that we believe is consistent with the more stringent pharmaceutical standards  rather than the standards set for dietary supplements 
attractive associate compensation plan and support 
we are committed to increasing our product sales by providing a highly competitive compensation plan to attract and retain associates who constitute our sales force 
we believe that our compensation plan is one of the most financially rewarding in the network marketing industry 
we further incent our associates by paying incentives on a weekly basis 
additionally  our compensation plan is  where legally permissible  a global seamless plan  meaning that associates can be compensated each week for their business success in any market in which they have a down line organization where we conduct business 
as noted elsewhere in this report  our china operations maintain their own compensation plan  which is structured differently than usana s plan in other markets 
we believe that our compensation plan in china is also among the most rewarding distributor compensation plans in that market 
to support our associates  we sponsor meetings and events throughout the year  which offer information about our products and our network marketing system 
these meetings are designed to assist associates in business development and to provide a forum for interaction with some of our associate leaders and with members of the usana management team 
we also provide low cost sales tools and resources  which we believe are an integral part of building and maintaining a successful home based business for our associates 
for example  we offer an interactive presentation tool  called health and freedom solution  which was created and designed to help our associates easily explain and share the usana opportunity  including the benefits of our products and our compensation plan 
in addition to company sponsored meetings and sales tools and resources  we maintain a website exclusively for our associates  where they can keep up on the latest usana news  obtain training materials  manage their personal information  enroll new customers  shop for products  and register for company sponsored events 
additionally  through this website  associates can access other online services to which they may subscribe 
for example  we offer an online business management service  which includes a tool that helps associates track and manage their business activity  a personal webpage to which prospects or retail customers can be directed  e cards for advertising  and a tax tracking tool 
we also believe that recognition is an important factor in supporting and retaining our associates 
we understand that being a successful usana associate requires hard work and dedication 
we 
table of contents frequently hold a variety of contests and promotions  rewarding our associates for their achievements to help motivate them and recognize their efforts 
we also celebrate key achievements and rank advancements of our associates 
we believe that our recognition programs and contests greatly contribute to our ability to retain our associates 
business model 
we believe that our business model provides  among others  the following advantages no requirement for a company employed sales force to sell our products  with a relatively low incremental cost to add a new associate  commissions paid to our associates are tied to sales performance  accounts receivable are minimal because payment is required at the time an associate or preferred customer purchases product  a stream of recurring revenue from our monthly product subscription program known as autoship  which we utilize in all of our markets for the year ended december   this program represented of our sales  and we can expand into new international markets with moderate investment because  for markets other than china  we generally maintain only one administrative and customer support office and one warehouse in each of these markets 
experienced management team 
our management team includes individuals with expertise in various scientific and managerial disciplines  including nutrition  product research and development  international development  marketing  customer network development  information technology  finance  legal  regulatory and operations 
this team is responsible for supporting growth  research and development  international expansion  strengthening our financial condition  and improving our internal controls 
growth strategy we seek to grow our business by pursuing the following strategies attract and retain associates 
our associates are the key to the growth of our business 
accordingly  we must continue to attract and retain associates 
for this reason  our management team maintains a close working relationship with our associate leaders 
one of our key initiatives in is to continue to strengthen this working relationship by holding more in person meetings between management and associates and by providing additional leadership training for associates 
in addition to our annual international convention and our asia pacific convention  we hold several regional events in key growth areas to provide support and training to new associates 
additionally  we continue to increase our investment in these events and in the marketing of our compensation plan to aid associates in improving the productivity of their businesses 
over the last couple of years we have worked closely with certain of our associate leaders to develop new and unique training tools to assist in the personal development and growth of our new associates 
these training tools are designed to serve as a guide for someone new to usana and network marketing who has the entrepreneurial spirit to own and operate a home based business 
in addition to these new sales tools  we have also increased our emphasis on building global awareness of the usana brand 
this includes our new sponsorship of the us ski team  as well as our enhanced partnership with the women s tennis association wta 
not only are we the official health supplement supplier to the wta  but we now have six top players who are dedicated to promoting our products and brand 
we seek to leverage this relationship to build brand credibility and increase product consumption and loyalty 
in addition to our sponsorship of professional athletes  we seek to advertise and collaborate with credible  nationally recognized organizations and individuals to enhance our global brand 
in  we began a strategic 
table of contents relationship with dr 
mehmet oz 
over the past or years  the world has witnessed the overwhelming rise in popularity of dr 
oz and  now  he has become a nationally recognized part of american culture 
in january  dr 
oz participated as a surprise guest on the usana monthly leadership call and the response from our associates was overwhelmingly positive 
in february  usana participated in the health and happiness summit with dr 
oz at radio city music hall in new york city 
dr 
wentz and dave wentz directly participated in this event and thousands of our associates attended this event as well 
going forward  this relationship will include dr 
oz s participation on future leadership calls and  more importantly  his participation at our annual international convention in august while branding efforts such as this have a global reach  the primary objective of this initiative is to grow sales and the number of associates in north america 
successfully develop china 
in light of the rapid growth in our asia pacific region and our successful asian associate base  we believe that china represents the most significant and imminent growth opportunity for us 
to capitalize on this opportunity  in august  we indirectly acquired babycare  a direct selling company organized under the laws of china 
we believe our acquisition of babycare accelerates our growth potential in china for several reasons  including i the license granted to babycare from the chinese government  which allows babycare to engage in direct selling in the municipality of beijing  and ii babycare s existing management team  which has agreed to continue to operate babycare and has extensive experience in the chinese direct selling market as well as in chinese government relations 
babycare is working to obtain similar direct selling licenses in other provinces within china 
our growth strategy in china entails continuing to register usana products in china and educate our associates on babycare s compensation plan in china 
in  we successfully launched several of our key optimizers and sens products in china through babycare 
the launch of these products expanded our presence in china s adult supplement market and  consequently  expanded our associates sales opportunities to existing and prospective chinese customers 
introduce new and re formulate existing products 
our research and development team is continually reviewing the latest scientific findings related to nutrition  conducting in house research and clinical trials  looking at new technologies  and attending scientific conferences 
if  in the process  we see potential for a new product or ingredient that provides a measurable and important health benefit  and if we believe this benefit can be realized by our customers  we will generally pursue development of that product 
our research and development focus in and going forward will be centered on personalization and innovation 
to the extent reasonably possible  we intend to personalize our product offering and product delivery systems to our customers individual needs 
an example of our personalization efforts is our myhealthpak product  which is a fully customized  pre packaged supplement regimen that can include virtually any of our essentials and optimizers 
we will also enhance our focus on innovation to develop new products and technologies 
to facilitate this  we have expanded our research and development team  increased our research and development investment  and expanded our collaborations with outside scientific experts and organizations 
enter new markets 
we believe that significant growth opportunities continue to exist in markets where we currently conduct business and in new international markets 
in  we announced our intent to become more aggressive in our international expansion efforts 
to this end  we announced that we would commence operations in thailand  france and belgium in we expect our operations in france and belgium to begin at the end of the first quarter of  and we expect our operations in thailand to have fully commenced by the middle of the second quarter of these new markets  as well as any future markets we may consider  are selected following an assessment of several factors  including market size  anticipated demand for usana products  receptiveness to network marketing  and the market entry process  which includes consideration of possible regulatory restrictions on our products or our network marketing system 
we have also begun to register certain products with regulatory and government agencies in other countries in preparation for further 
table of contents international expansion 
wherever possible  we expect to seamlessly integrate the compensation plan in each market to allow associates to receive commissions for global not merely local product sales 
this seamless down line structure is designed to allow an associate to build a global network by creating a down line across national borders 
we believe our seamless compensation plan significantly enhances our ability to expand internationally  and we intend  where permitted  to integrate the future markets that we open into this plan 
while we deem new market expansion as a key growth strategy  given the significant opportunity that currently exists in china  we plan to focus the majority of our time and resources on growing sales in that market 
pursue strategic acquisitions 
we believe that attractive acquisition opportunities may arise in the future 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that would grow our customer base  expand our product lines  enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise  allow vertical integration  or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals 
personalization 
in pursuing the personalization of our products  technologies  and systems to meet the individual needs of our associates  we will look to and consider the opportunities that each of the above items present in helping to accomplish this objective 
we plan to introduce some of the results of our focus on personalization and innovation at our annual international convention in competition we compete with manufacturers  distributors  and retailers of nutritional products for consumers  and with network marketing companies for distributors 
on both fronts  some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are  have longer operating history  higher visibility and name recognition  and greater financial resources than we do 
we compete with these entities by emphasizing the underlying science  value  and superior quality of our products  the simplicity in our product offerings  and the convenience and financial benefits afforded by our network marketing system and global seamless compensation plan 
our business is driven primarily by our distributors  whom we refer to as associates 
our ability to compete with other network marketing companies depends  in significant part  on our success in attracting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for attracting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in network marketing is limited in each market and is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully attract these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe that we offer an attractive opportunity for our associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
we believe that the leading network marketing company in the world  based on total sales  is amway corporation and its affiliates  and that avon products  inc is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional network marketing and nutritional product industry include herbalife ltd  inc  nu skin enterprises  inc  and nbty  inc 
based on information that is publicly available  net sales of the aforementioned companies ranged from billion to billion 
there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that have or may launch direct selling enterprises that compete with us in certain product lines and in the recruiting of associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by increased competition 
product returns product returns have not been a material factor in our business  totaling approximately in  and in both and because our emphasis on customer satisfaction is a hallmark of our business model  our standard policy allows associates to return any unused product from their first 
table of contents purchase within the first days following their purchase for a refund of the sales price 
thereafter  any returned product that is unused and resalable is refunded up to one year from the date of purchase at of the sales price  less a restocking fee 
according to the terms of the associate agreement  return of product where the purchase amount exceeds and was not damaged at the time of receipt by the associate may result in cancellation of the associate s distributorship 
depending upon the conditions under which product was returned associates and preferred customers may either receive a refund based on their original form of payment  or credit on account for a product exchange 
this standard policy differs slightly in a few of our international markets due to the regulatory environment in those markets 
major customers sales are made to independent associates and preferred customers 
no single customer accounted for or more of net sales 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the nature of our business model results in a significant amount of sales to several different associate leaders and their downline sales organizations 
although no single associate accounted for or more of our net sales  the loss of a key associate leader or that associate s downline sales organization could adversely affect our net sales and our overall operating results 
compliance by associates we continually monitor and review our associates compliance with our policies and procedures as well as the laws and regulations applicable to our business 
part of this review entails an assessment of our associates sales activities to ensure that associates are actually selling products to consumers 
our policies and procedures require associates to present our products and the usana opportunity ethically and honestly 
associates are not permitted to make claims about our products or compensation plan that are not consistent with our policies and procedures and applicable laws and regulations 
the majority of our associates must use marketing and promotional materials provided by usana 
associates who have achieved a certain leadership threshold are permitted  however  to produce their own marketing and promotional materials  but only if such materials are approved by usana prior to use 
from time to time  some associates fail to adhere to our policies and procedures 
we systematically review reports of alleged associate misbehavior 
infractions of the policies and procedures are reported to our compliance group  who determine what disciplinary action is warranted in each case 
more serious infractions are reported to our compliance committee  which includes usana executives 
if we determine that an associate has violated any of our policies and procedures  we may take a number of disciplinary actions  such as warnings  fines or probation 
we may also withdraw or deny awards  suspend privileges  withhold commissions until specific conditions are satisfied  or take other appropriate actions in our discretion 
more serious infractions may result in termination of the associate s purchase and distribution rights 
we believe that associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business  and  therefore  we are aggressive in ensuring that our associates comply with our policies and procedures 
as explained above  when an associate fails to comply with our policies and procedures  we may terminate their purchase and distribution rights 
from time to time  we become involved in litigation with associates whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated 
we consider such litigation to be routine and incidental to our business and will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our associates comply with our policies and procedures 

table of contents information technology we believe that the ability to efficiently manage distribution  compensation  manufacturing  inventory  and communication functions through the use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems is critical to our success 
our information technology resources are maintained primarily by our in house staff to optimally support our customer base and core business processes 
our it staff manages an array of systems and processes which support our global operations hours a day and days a year 
three of our most critical applications include a web based application that provides online services to associates  such as training sessions and presentations  online shopping  enrollment  real time reporting engine  company and product information  web hosting  email  and other tools to help associates effectively manage their business and down line organizations 
a web based order entry system that handles order entry  customer information  compensation  the hierarchy of associates  returns  invoices  and other transactional based processes 
a fully integrated world wide enterprise resource planning erp system that handles accounting  human resources  inventory management  production processes  quality assurance  and reporting requirements in a multinational environment 
our web applications are supported by a clustered environment and a redundant system outside of our home office  which serves as a disaster recovery site 
regulatory matters product regulation 
numerous governmental agencies in the united states and other countries regulate the manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  promoting  distributing  and the selling of nutrition  health  beauty  and weight management products 
in the united states  advertisement of our products is regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act and  where such advertising is considered to be product labeling by the fda  under the food  drug  and cosmetic act fdca and the regulations thereunder 
usana products in the us are also subject to regulation by  among others  the consumer product safety commission  the us department of agriculture  and the environmental protection agency 
the manufacturing  labeling  and advertising of our products are also regulated by various governmental agencies in each country in which they are distributed 
for example  in australia  product registration  labeling and manufacturing is regulated by the tga and  in japan  the ministry of health  labor and welfare 
in china  the state food and drug administration sfda regulates product registration  labeling and manufacturing 
our largest selling product group includes products that are regulated as dietary supplements under the fdca 
dietary supplements are also regulated in the united states under the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea  which we believe is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry 
some of our powdered drink  food bar  and other nutrition products are regulated as foods under the nutrition labeling and education act of nlea 
the nlea establishes requirements for ingredient and nutritional labeling including product labeling claims 
the manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the united states requires compliance with dietary supplement gmps  which are based on the food model gmps  with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements 
we believe our manufacturing processes comply with these gmps for dietary supplements 
in general  our personal care products  which are regulated as cosmetic products by the fda  are not subject to pre market approval by that agency 
cosmetics  however  are subject to regulation by the fda under the fdca adulteration and misbranding provisions 
cosmetics also are subject to specific labeling regulations  including warning statements  if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately 
table of contents substantiated or if the product may be hazardous  as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under the fair packaging and labeling act 
cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug ie  that are intended to treat or prevent disease or affect the structure or function of the body  such as sunscreens  are regulated as drugs 
over the counter otc drug products  including cosmetics  may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of the otc monograph that is applicable to that drug 
drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved new drug application nda before marketing may begin 
under these provisions  if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our otc drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one of our otc drug products  we would be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved nda or until the time  if ever  that the monograph is amended to include such product 
advertising of our products in the us is subject to regulation by the ftc under the ftc act 
under the ftc s substantiation doctrine  an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made 
failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices 
pursuant to this ftc requirement  we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the us in recent years  the ftc has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplement  weight management  and cosmetic products 
the ftc has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement 
we believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the us  and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines 
however  no assurance can be given that the ftc would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the us the ftc may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways  both administratively and judicially  using compulsory process  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement can result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  corrective advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
although  to our knowledge  we have not been the subject of any action by the ftc  no assurance can be given that the ftc will not question our advertising or other operations in the us in the future 
any action in the future by the ftc could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the us the dietary supplement nonprescription drug consumer protection act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over the counter products to notify the fda when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the united states 
we have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years and believe that we are in compliance with this law 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s food administration  ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of usana products for the market or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with local product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
for example  china extensively regulates the registration  labeling and marketing of our products 
in china  our nutritional products are typically classified as health foods and our personal care products are typically classified as non special purpose cosmetics 
the registration process for health foods is complex and generally requires extensive analysis and approval by the 
table of contents sfda 
as a result  it may take several years to register a product as a health food in china 
in addition to the health food products for which registration has already been successfully completed  we registered several usana health food products and introduced these products for sale by our associates in china during we continue to work through the registration process for other health food products  which we also hope to begin selling through babycare in the future 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
future changes could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
network marketing regulation 
laws and regulations in each country in which we operate prevent the use of deceptive or fraudulent practices that have sometimes been inappropriately associated with legitimate direct selling and network marketing activities 
generally these laws are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within sales organizations is based on sales of the enterprise s products  rather than on investments in the organizations or on other criteria or activity that are not related to retail sales 
where required by law  we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing system  or  where approval is not required or available  the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance 
in addition to the ftc  each state has enacted its own little ftc act to regulate sales and advertising 
occasionally  we receive requests to supply information regarding our network marketing plan to regulatory agencies 
although we have  from time to time  modified our network marketing system to comply with interpretations of various regulatory authorities  we believe that our network marketing program is compliant with the laws and regulations relating to network marketing activities in our current markets 
nevertheless  we remain subject to the risk that  in one or more of our present or future markets  the marketing system or the conduct of certain associates could be found not to be compliant with applicable laws and regulations 
failure by an associate or by us to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general 
the direct selling laws and regulations in china require us to operate under a business model  which is different from our global business model 
to expand into china and comply with these regulations  we indirectly acquired babycare in august and will utilize babycare s existing business model  which has been designed specifically for china 
china s direct selling regulations contain both financial and operational restrictions for direct selling companies 
for example  babycare  and other direct selling companies  are not permitted to pay multi level compensation to sales representatives and are also limited in the amount of single level compensation that they may pay to sales representatives 
additionally  babycare is required to obtain various licenses and approvals to conduct its direct selling business in china 
babycare has been granted a license to engage in direct selling activities in the municipality of beijing and is working to obtain similar licenses in other cities and provinces 
this license allows babycare to operate under its direct selling business model in beijing by utilizing non employee sales representatives to sell products away from fixed retail locations 
in cities and provinces where babycare has not been issued a direct selling license  it must operate under a retail sales model 
under this retail model  babycare utilizes non employee sales representatives to sell its products through retail stores in the applicable city or province 
babycare has also engaged independent service providers that meet both the requirements to operate their own business under chinese law as well as the conditions set forth by babycare to sell products and provide services to babycare customers 
if  and when  babycare receives a direct selling license in other cities 
table of contents and provinces  it will continue to transition away from this retail model and integrate its direct selling business model in these cities and provinces 
we cannot predict the nature of any future law  regulation  interpretation  or application  nor can we predict what effect additional governmental legislation or regulations  judicial decisions  or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on our business 
it is possible that future legal requirements may require that we revise our network marketing program 
such new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
transfer pricing regulation 
in the us and many other countries  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations that are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported by our us or international entities and are taxed accordingly 
we have adopted transfer prices  which are supported by a formal transfer pricing study for the sale of products to our subsidiaries in accordance with applicable transfer pricing laws 
in addition  agreements between our subsidiaries and us have been entered into for services and contractual obligations  such as the payment of associate incentives that are also supported by the same formal transfer pricing study 
if the us internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in our standard transfer pricing practices for products  we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings may be adversely affected 
the tax treaties between the us and most countries provide competent authority for relief to avoid any double taxation 
we believe that we operate in compliance with all applicable transfer pricing regulations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with transfer pricing regulations or that those laws will not be modified  which may require that we change our operating procedures 
intellectual property trademarks 
we have developed and we use registered trademarks in our business  particularly relating to our corporate and product names 
we own trademarks that are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
federal registration of a trademark enables the registered owner of the mark to bar the unauthorized use of the registered mark in connection with a similar product in the same channels of trade by any third party anywhere in the united states  regardless of whether the registered owner has ever used the trademark in the area where the unauthorized use occurs 
we have filed applications and own trademark registrations  and we intend to register additional trademarks in countries where usana products are or may be sold in the future 
protection of registered trademarks in some jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection in the united states 
we also claim ownership and protection of certain product names  unregistered trademarks  and service marks under common law 
common law trademark rights do not provide the same level of protection that is afforded by the registration of a trademark 
in addition  common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used 
we believe these trademarks  whether registered or claimed under common law  constitute valuable assets  adding to recognition of usana and the effective marketing of usana products 
trademark registration once obtained is essentially perpetual  subject to the payment of a renewal fee 
we therefore believe that these proprietary rights have been and will continue to be important in enabling us to compete 
trade secrets 
we own certain intellectual property  including trade secrets that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees and other parties 
even where these agreements exist  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors 
our proprietary product formulations are generally considered trade secrets  but are not otherwise protected under intellectual property laws 

table of contents patents 
we have three us patents 
two of our patents relate to the method of extracting an antioxidant from olives and the byproducts of olive oil production 
these patents were issued in and will continue in force until december  in  we entered into a licensing agreement with a supplier to make olive extract using our patented process 
our third patent relates to a method of self preserving our sens line of personal care products 
this patent was issued in may and will continue in force until august  we intend to protect our legal rights concerning intellectual property by all appropriate legal action 
consequently  we may become involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of any of the foregoing proprietary rights 
any patent litigation could result in substantial cost and divert the efforts of management and technical personnel 
seasonality we typically see a decrease in the activity of many of our north american associates during the third quarter due to the summer vacation season 
additionally  many associates reduce their spending prior to our international convention  which is held toward the end of the third quarter every year  in anticipation of new product launches or product upgrades 
similarly  we typically see a decrease in the activity of many of our asia pacific associates during the first quarter due to cultural events such as chinese new year 
backlog our products are typically shipped within hours after receipt of an order 
as of march  we had no significant backlog of orders 
working capital practices we maintain sufficient amounts of inventory in stock in order to provide a high level of service to our associates and preferred customers 
substantial inventories are required to meet the needs of our dual role as manufacturer and distributor 
we also watch seasonal commodity markets and may buy ahead of normal demand to hedge against cost increases and supply risks 
environment we are not aware of any instance in which we have contravened federal  state  or local laws relating to protection of the environment or in which we otherwise may be subject to liability for environmental conditions that could materially affect operations 
employees as of march  we had approximately  employees worldwide  as measured by full time equivalency 
our employees are not currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced work stoppages as a result of labor disputes 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements and certain risks we encounter substantial risks in our business  any one of which may adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the fact that some of these risk factors may be the same or similar to those that we have filed with the securities and exchange commission in past reports  means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks that are described here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and will likely be present in all periods 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
these risk factors should be read together with the other items in this report  including item  business  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect our business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations include the following our hong kong market accounts for a significant part of our business 
any decline in sales or customers in this market  without a corresponding increase in sales and customers in our china market through babycare  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
over the past few years  the majority of our sales and associate growth has occurred in our hong kong market  which represented of our net sales in following our acquisition of babycare in china  we announced that we would shift our international attention to growing our business in china 
as a result of this strategy  we will likely experience a decline in sales and or customers in our hong kong market 
factors that could contribute to a decline in hong kong include  among other things i we have many associate leaders in hong kong who qualify to do business in both hong kong and china and who may shift their attention to growing their businesses in china  and ii many of our associates  who act simply as consumers of our products and have historically purchased our products in hong kong  may begin to purchase our products in china 
any decline in the performance of our hong kong market without a corresponding increase in the performance in china would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must comply with significant legal and regulatory requirements to engage in direct selling in china and must also use a separate compensation plan for our associates in china  which is structured differently than our compensation plan in other markets 
although we believe that  in light of our successful asian associate base  we will be successful in growing our business in china  it is difficult to assess the extent to which our chinese business model and associate compensation plan will be accepted or successful in that market 
although we are required to conduct our operations in china through babycare  we believe that our success in china will depend on our ability to successfully integrate  to the extent legally possible  our operations with babycare s operations 
this includes  among other things  registering usana products  in a timely manner  for sale in china and educating our associates on our compensation plan in china 
in light of the factors listed above  and the other risks to our business  there can be no assurance that we will not experience a decline in sales and or customers in our hong kong market or that we will be successful in growing sales and customers in china 
difficult economic conditions may adversely affect our business 
over the past few years  economic conditions in many of the markets where we sell our products have resulted in challenges to our business 
this is particularly true in our north america region  where  despite various initiatives  our business has continued to decline 
we cannot predict whether world or market specific economies 
table of contents will improve or deteriorate in the future 
if difficult economic conditions continue or worsen  we could experience declines in net sales  profitability and cash flow due to lower demand for our products or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers  potential customers or suppliers 
additionally  these conditions may result in a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources or otherwise negatively impact our operations or overall financial condition 
as a network marketing company  we are dependent upon an independent sales force and we do not have direct control over the marketing of our products 
we rely on non employee  independent associates to market and sell our products and to generate our sales 
associates typically market and sell our products on a part time basis and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with us 
we have a large number of associates and a relatively small corporate staff to implement our marketing programs and to provide motivational support to our associates 
we rely primarily upon our associates to attract  train and motivate new associates 
our sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of our associates 
our ability to maintain and increase sales in the future will depend in large part upon our success in increasing the number of new associates  retaining and motivating our existing associates  and in improving the productivity of our associates 
we can provide no assurances that the number of associates will increase or remain constant or that their productivity will increase 
our associates may terminate their services at any time  and  like most direct selling companies  we experience a high turnover among new associates from year to year 
we experienced a decline in the number of active associates during prior to  we experienced a increase in the number of active associates during  and a increase during in particular  we have experienced declines in the number of active associates in the united states and  most recently  hong kong 
if our initiatives for do not drive growth in our associate numbers  particularly in the united states and other markets where our associate numbers have declined  our operating results could be harmed 
we cannot accurately predict any fluctuation in the number and productivity of associates because we primarily rely upon existing associates to sponsor and train new associates and to motivate new and existing associates 
our operating results in other markets could also be adversely affected if we and our existing associates do not generate sufficient interest in our business to successfully retain existing associates and attract new associates 
the loss of a significant usana associate or downline sales organization could adversely affect our business 
we rely on the successful efforts of our associates that become leaders within our compensation plan 
our compensation plan is designed to permit associates to sponsor new associates  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the downline organization 
sponsored associates are referred to as downline associates within the sponsoring associate s downline network 
if these downline associates in turn sponsor new associates  additional business centers are created  with the new downline associates becoming part of the original sponsoring associate s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  associates develop business relationships with other associates 
the loss of a key associate or group of associates  large turnover or decreases in the size of the key associate force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction  the costs associated with training new associates  and other related expenses may adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
moreover  our ability to continue to attract and retain associates can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general business and economic conditions  adverse publicity or negative misinformation about us or our products  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceedings against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  
table of contents public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care  or weight management products generally  other competing network marketing organizations entering into the marketplace that may recruit our existing associates or reduce the potential pool of new associates  and changes to the compensation plan required by law or implemented for business reasons that make attracting and retaining associates more difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain associates in sufficient numbers to sustain future growth or to maintain our present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our associate compensation plan  or changes we make to it  may be viewed negatively by some associates  could fail to achieve our desired objectives  and could have a negative impact on our business 
our line of business is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new competitors  new products and or new distributor compensation plans 
network marketing companies commonly attempt to attract new distributors by offering generous distributor compensation plans 
we believe our compensation plan is among the most competitive and generous in the network marketing industry 
from time to time  we modify components of our compensation plan in an effort to i keep it competitive and attractive to existing and potential associates  ii cause or address a change in associate behavior  iii incent associates to grow our business  iv conform to legal and regulatory requirements  and v address other business needs 
in light of the size and diversity of our associate force and the complexity of our compensation plan  it is difficult to predict how any changes to the plan will be viewed by associates and whether such changes will achieve their desired results 
for example  certain changes we made to our compensation plan in were very successful in certain markets in our asia pacific region  but were unsuccessful in many of our markets and regions 
in  we made additional changes to our compensation plan in an effort to encourage more entrepreneurial associates to join the company and build a sales organization at an accelerated pace 
while these changes successfully caused us to enroll more entrepreneurial associates  they have made it more challenging for us to enroll associates in general  including those who simply consume our products and are less entrepreneurial 
as a result  our associate counts have decreased in most of our markets  including north america 
we cannot assure you that our associate compensation plan will allow us to successfully attract new associates or retain existing associates  nor can we assure you that any changes we make to our compensation plan will achieve our desired results 
the violation of marketing or advertising laws by associates in connection with the sale of our products or the improper promotion of our compensation plan could adversely affect our business 
all associates sign a written contract and agree to adhere to our policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit associates from making false  misleading and other improper claims regarding products or income potential from the distribution of the products  associates may  from time to time  without our knowledge and in violation of our policies  create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe our marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims  or other matters in violation of our policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
these violations may result in legal action against us by regulatory agencies  state attorneys general  or private parties 
legal actions against our associates or others who are associated with us could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of our business  including our network marketing system 
we take what we believe to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor the activities of our associates to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by associates and to assure that the terms of our policies and procedures and compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
adverse publicity resulting from such 
table of contents activities could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain associates and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
legal action by former associates or third parties against us could harm our business 
we continually monitor and review our associates compliance with our policies and procedures as well the laws and regulations applicable to our business 
from time to time  some associates fail to adhere to our policies and procedures 
if this happens  we may take disciplinary action against the particular associate 
this disciplinary action is based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and may include anything from warnings for minor violations to termination of an associate s purchase and distribution rights for more serious violations 
from time to time  we become involved in litigation with an associate whose purchase and distribution rights have been terminated 
we consider this type of litigation to be routine and incidental to our business 
while neither the existence nor the outcome of this type of litigation is typically material to our business  in the past we have been involved in litigation of this nature that resulted in a large cash award against the company 
our competitors have also been involved in this type of litigation  and in some cases class actions  where the result has been a large cash award against the competitor or a large cash settlement by the competitor 
these types of challenges  awards or settlements could provide incentives for similar actions by other former associates against us in the future 
any such challenge involving us or others in our industry could harm our business by resulting in fines or damages against us  creating adverse publicity about us or our industry  or hurting our ability to attract and retain customers 
we believe that associate compliance is critical to the integrity of our business  and  therefore  we will continue to be aggressive in ensuring that our associates comply with our policies and procedures 
as such  we cannot assure you that this type of litigation will not occur again in the future or result in an award or settlement that has a materially adverse effect on our business 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation  which adds to the expense of doing business and the possibility that changes in the law might adversely affect our ability to sell some of our products in certain markets 
network marketing systems  such as ours  are frequently subject to laws and regulations  both in the us and internationally  that are directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition  and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than on investment in the sponsoring company 
regulatory authorities  in one or more of our present or future markets  could determine that our network marketing system does not comply with these laws and regulations or that it is prohibited 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
further  we may simply be prohibited from distributing products through a network marketing channel in some countries  or we may be forced to alter our compensation plan 
we are also subject to the risk that new laws or regulations might be implemented or that current laws or regulations might change  which could require us to change or modify the way we conduct our business in certain markets 
this could be particularly detrimental to us if we had to change or modify the way we conduct business in markets that represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
for example  the ftc released a proposed new business opportunity rule in april as initially drafted  the proposed rule would have required pre sale disclosures for all business opportunities  which may have included network marketing compensation plans such as ours 
however  in march the ftc issued a revised notice of proposed rulemaking  which indicates that the new business opportunity rule as drafted will not apply to multi level marketing companies 
we may have or incur obligations relating to the activities of our associates 
our associates are subject to taxation  and  in some instances  legislation or governmental agencies impose an obligation on us to collect taxes  such as sales taxes or value added taxes  and to maintain appropriate records of such transactions 
in addition  we are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for 
table of contents social security and similar taxes with respect to our associates 
in the event that local laws and regulations or the interpretation of local laws and regulations change to require us to treat our independent associates as employees  or if our associates are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors  under existing laws and interpretations  we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees  including social security and related taxes in those jurisdictions  plus any related assessments and penalties  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
our ability to attract and retain associates and to sustain and enhance sales through our associates can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding our industry  our competition  or our business generally 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether those investigations involve us or our associates or the business practices or products of our competitors or other network marketing companies 
in  we were the victim of false statements made to the press and regulatory agencies  causing us to incur significant expense in defending and dispelling the allegations during and this adverse publicity also adversely impacted the market price of our stock and caused insecurity among our associates 
there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the loss of key management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our founder  dr 
myron wentz  is a highly visible spokesman for our products and our business  and our message is based in large part on his vision and reputation  which helps distinguish us from our competitors 
any loss or limitation on dr 
wentz as a lead spokesman for our mission  business  and products could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
in addition  our executive officers are primarily responsible for our day to day operations  and we believe our success depends in part on our ability to retain our executive officers  to compensate our executive officers at attractive levels  and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to our management team 
we cannot guarantee continued service by our key executive officers 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers  nor do we have an employment agreement with any of our executive officers 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of our executive officers or the inability to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the beneficial ownership of a significant percentage of our common stock gives our founder and parties related to or affiliated with him effective control  and limits the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
gull holdings  ltd  an entity that is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owned of our outstanding common stock at december  by virtue of this stock ownership  dr 
wentz is able to exert significant influence over the election of the members of our board of directors and our business affairs 
this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  dr 
wentz also currently serves as chairman of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to this directorship or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to other shareholders of the company 
sales by our shareholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
a large number of outstanding shares of our common stock are held by several of our principal shareholders 
if any of these principal shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents our stock price has been volatile and subject to various market conditions 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry  negative publicity  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many dietary and nutritional supplement companies and which have  in certain cases  not had a strong correlation to the operating performance of these companies 
our operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries  including the us food and drug administration fda and the us federal trade commission ftc 
for example  failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
with respect to ftc matters  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders  and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  or such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action against us by the ftc could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
the manufacture of nutritional or dietary supplements and related products in the united states requires compliance with dietary supplement gmps  which are based on the food model gmps  with additional requirements that are specific to dietary supplements 
we believe our manufacturing processes comply with these gmps for dietary supplements 
nevertheless  any action by the fda which determined that our processes were non compliant with dietary supplement gmps  could materially adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products 
additionally  the dietary supplement nonprescription drug consumer protection act requires manufacturers of dietary supplement and over the counter products to notify the fda when they receive reports of serious adverse events occurring within the united states 
potential fda responses to any such report could include injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  or criminal prosecutions 
we have an internal adverse event reporting system that has been in place for several years and believe that we are in compliance with this new law 
nevertheless  any action by the fda in response to a serious adverse event report that may be filed by us could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or a comparable agency 
for example  our manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and health canada and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from 
table of contents country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies of the countries in which our products are sold 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  could have on our business 
these potential effects could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping and reporting requirements  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  or additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects  and we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and other similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
our international operations are presently conducted in various foreign countries  and we expect that the number of countries in which we operate could expand over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets  may adversely affect our customers  their demand for our products and their ability to pay for our products 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
these risks could restrict our ability to sell products to or to obtain international customers or to operate our international business profitably  and our overall business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by our foreign activities 
the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption  and in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti bribery laws 
further  we require our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees  our agents and others who work with us in foreign countries comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws  there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could incur severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  detecting  investigating and resolving actual or alleged fcpa violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
our net sales are significantly affected by our success in growing existing markets  as well as opening new markets 
as we continue to expand into international markets  our business becomes increasingly subject to political  economic  legal and other risks 
changes in these markets could adversely affect our business 
we have a history of expanding into new international markets 
we believe that our ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on our ability to continue our international expansion efforts 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to grow in our existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis  or that new markets will be profitable 
we must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before we can 
table of contents begin marketing in any international market 
also  before marketing commences in a new country or market  it is difficult to assess the extent to which our products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  we may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
we may be required to reformulate certain of our products before commencing sales in a given country 
once we have entered a market  we must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate our products in any of our current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or to attract local customers 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals in new markets  or that we will have sufficient capital to finance our expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  other network marketing companies already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local associate population to a new opportunity  such as usana  or to make it more difficult for us to attract qualified associates 
even if we are able to commence operations in new markets  there may not be a sufficient population of persons who are interested in our network marketing system 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to seamlessly integrate our compensation plan across all markets where legally permissible 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to utilize our compensation plan seamlessly in all existing or future markets 
for example  in august  we indirectly acquired babycare  a nutritional supplement company that is licensed by the government of the people s republic of china the prc or china to engage in direct selling in the municipality of beijing 
under chinese law  single level compensation models are permitted  but multi level compensation models  as practiced by usana and many other direct selling companies  are not 
our operations in china  therefore  utilize a single level compensation model  which is separate and different from our compensation plan in our other markets 
we will continue to utilize a separate compensation model in china  and usana s compensation plan will not be integrated into or utilized in china 
our operations in china are subject to significant government scrutiny and may be harmed by the results of such scrutiny 
because of the government s significant concerns about direct selling activities  government regulators in china closely scrutinize activities of direct selling companies or activities that resemble direct selling 
the regulatory environment in china with regard to direct selling is evolving  and officials in multiple national and local levels in the chinese government often exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply applicable regulations 
in the past  the government has taken significant actions against companies that the government has found have been engaging in direct selling activities in violation of applicable law  including shutting down their businesses and imposing substantial fines 
any determination that our operations or activities  or the activities of our sales employees  contractual sales promoters  direct sellers or associates are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines  extended interruptions of business  termination of necessary licenses and permits  including our direct selling licenses  or restrictions on our ability to open new stores  obtain approvals for service centers or expand into new locations  all of which could harm our business 
our business will be adversely affected if chinese regulatory authorities view our direct selling and other corporate activities as non compliant with applicable chinese laws and regulations 
our operations in china may be deemed to be subject to numerous chinese commercial laws  including restrictions on foreign investments 
in addition  the chinese regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may change applicable laws and regulations or impose additional requirements and conditions with which we may be unable to comply 
our operations in china are licensed to engage in direct selling activity in the municipality of beijing 
we have not sought confirmation from chinese 
table of contents regulatory governmental authorities whether our structure and business in china complies with applicable chinese laws and regulations  including regulation of direct selling business in china 
if chinese authorities deem our corporate activities as violating applicable chinese laws and regulations including restrictions on foreign investments  chinese regulatory authorities change applicable laws and regulations or impose additional requirements and conditions with which we are unable to comply  or we are found to violate any existing or future chinese laws or regulations  the relevant chinese authorities would have broad discretion to deal with such a violation by levying fines  revoking business licenses  requiring us to restructure our china ownership or operations  and require us to discontinue some or all of our business in china 
any of these actions would adversely affect our business 
the direct selling license granted to our operations in china is limited in its scope 
to engage in direct selling activity outside the municipality of beijing  we will be required to obtain licenses from other municipalities and provinces within china 
if we are unable to obtain additional necessary national and local government approvals in china as quickly as we would like  our ability to expand and grow our business could be negatively impacted 
the process for obtaining the necessary government approvals to conduct direct selling continues to evolve 
the process is time consuming and expensive 
the complexity of the approval process  as well as the government s continued cautious approach as direct selling develops in china  makes it difficult to predict the timeline for obtaining additional approvals 
if the results of the government s evaluation of our direct selling activities result in further delays in obtaining licenses elsewhere  or if the current processes for obtaining approvals are delayed further for any reason or are changed or are interpreted differently than currently understood  our ability to expand direct selling in china and our growth prospects in this market  could be negatively impacted 
we currently are only allowed by the prc to sell through direct selling the limited number of products that are manufactured in china by us 
if we wish to sell additional products other than those already approved through the direct selling channel  we must successfully complete a product approval process similar to the process described above 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining such additional product approvals on a timely basis or at all 
a return to profit repatriation controls may limit the ability to expand business and reduce the attractiveness of investing in chinese business opportunities 
chinese law allows enterprises owned by foreign investors to remit their profits  dividends and bonuses earned in china to other countries  and the remittance does not require prior approval by the state administration of foreign exchange safe 
safe regulations require extensive documentation and reporting  some of which are burdensome and slows payments 
if there is a return to payment restrictions and reporting  the ability of a chinese company to attract investors will be reduced 
also  current investors may not be able to obtain the profits of the businesses they own for other reasons 
relevant chinese law and regulation permit payment of dividends only from retained earnings  if any  determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations 
it is possible that the chinese tax authorities may require changes in the calculation of distributable net income of our operations in china that may limit our ability to pay dividends and other distributions to stockholders 
chinese law requires companies to set aside a portion of net income to fund certain reserves  which amounts are not distributable as dividends 
these rules and possible changes could restrict us from repatriating funds 
our ability to enforce our material agreements in china is uncertain 
chinese law will govern our material operating agreements 
there is no assurance that we will be able to enforce those material agreements or that remedies will be available outside china 
the chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial laws  leading to a substantial degree of 
table of contents uncertainty as to the outcome of litigation 
the inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under our agreements may have a material adverse impact on our operations 
intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in china 
chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to most of our other major markets  and  as a result  we may have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter significant difficulties with patent or trademark infringers 
limited protection of intellectual property is available under chinese law  and the local manufacturing of our products may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to manufacture and sell counterfeited products or copy or otherwise obtain or use our product formulations 
as a result  we cannot assure that we will be able to adequately protect our product formulations or other intellectual property in china 
an increase in the amount of incentives paid to associates reduces our profitability 
the payment of associate incentives is our most significant expense 
these incentives include commissions  bonuses  and certain awards and prizes 
from time to time  we adjust our compensation plan to better manage these incentives as a percentage of net sales 
we closely monitor the amount of associate incentives that are paid as a percentage of net sales  and may periodically adjust our compensation plan to prevent associate incentives from having a significant adverse effect on our earnings 
there can be no assurance that changes to the compensation plan or product pricing will be successful in achieving target levels of associate incentives as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  such changes may make it difficult to attract and retain qualified and motivated associates or cause us to lose some of our longer standing associates 
our business is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier  and more established competitors 
we face intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  and other nutritional products  as described in greater detail in business competition 
numerous manufacturers  associates  and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for associates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition and personal care products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution  including retail stores 
our product offerings in each product category are also relatively small  compared to the wide variety of products offered by many of our competitors 
we are also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention  and commitment of new and existing associates 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on our success in recruiting and retaining associates 
there can be no assurance that our programs for recruiting and retaining associates will be successful 
the pool of individuals who may be interested in network marketing is limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although we believe we offer an attractive opportunity for associates  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit our existing associates or deplete the pool of potential associates in a given market 
taxation and transfer pricing considerations affect our operations 
in many countries  including the united states  we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations that are designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported by our us and foreign entities and are taxed appropriately 
although we believe that we are in compliance with all material regulations and restrictions in this regard  we are subject to the risk that taxing authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed 
we are also subject to the risk that taxing authorities in any of our markets could change the laws in a manner that may increase our effective tax rate and or duties on our products 
under tax treaties  we are eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for foreign taxes actually paid abroad 
in the event any audits or 
table of contents assessments are concluded adversely to us  we may or may not be able to offset the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of us foreign tax credits 
currently  we are utilizing all foreign tax credits in the year in which they arise 
because the laws and regulations governing us foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment  we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future 
as a result  adverse outcomes in these matters could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results 
fluctuation in the value of currency exchange rates with the us dollar affects our operations and our net sales and earnings 
over the past several years  a significant portion of our net sales have been generated outside the united states 
such sales for the year ended december  represented of our total net sales 
we will likely continue to expand our operations into new markets  exposing us to expanding risks of changes in social  political  and economic conditions  including changes in the laws and policies that govern investment or exchange in these markets 
because a significant portion of our sales are generated outside the united states  exchange rate fluctuations will have a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for us to establish or to continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which we and our competitors sell similar products in the same market 
as our business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and operating costs will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that our us financial results be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases by our subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as our operations expand in countries where transactions may be made in currencies other than the us dollar  our operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact that these changes might have on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect our sales to customers outside the united states 
currently our strategy for reducing our exposure to currency fluctuation includes the timely and efficient repatriation of earnings from international markets and settlement of intercompany transactions 
at times in the past we have sought to reduce exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of currency exchange contracts on cash that we repatriate 
we did not enter into any such contracts during  but we may look to something like this in the coming year 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our operating results or cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
any such adverse effects could also adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
disruptions to shipping channels that we use to distribute our products to international warehouses may adversely affect our margins and profitability in those markets 
in the past  we have felt the impact of disruptions to the shipping channels used to distribute our products  these disruptions have included increased port congestion  a lack of capacity on the railroads  and a shortage of manpower 
although we have not recently experienced significant shipping disruptions  we continue to watch for signs of upcoming congestion 
congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies  resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our net sales 
the inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for products at favorable prices  or at all  or the inability to obtain certain products from third party suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we acquire all of our raw 
table of contents materials for the manufacture of our products from third party suppliers 
materials used in manufacturing our products are purchased through purchase order  often invoking pre negotiated annual supply agreements 
we have very few long term agreements for the supply of these materials 
we also contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of some of our products  including most of our gelatin capsuled supplements  probiotic  rev energy drink  our powdered drink mixes and nutrition bars  and certain of our personal care products 
these third party suppliers and manufacturers produce and  in most cases  package these products according to formulations that have been developed by  or in conjunction with  our in house product development team 
there is a risk that any of our suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue manufacturing our products or selling their products to us 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages or back orders for products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
in certain situations  we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different products from another source 
we have  in the past  discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products that were manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials or manufactured products that are needed by us in the quantities that we request or at the prices that we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of certain raw materials and products  we are also subject to delays caused by any interruption in the production of these materials  based on conditions not within our control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
shortages of raw materials may temporarily adversely affect our margins or our profitability related to the sale of those products 
in the past  we have experienced temporary shortages of the raw materials used in certain of our nutritional products 
although we had identified multiple sources to supply such raw material ingredients  quantities of the materials we purchased during these shortages were at higher prices  which negatively impacted our gross margins for those products 
while we periodically experience price increases due to unexpected raw material shortages and other unanticipated events  this has historically not resulted in a material effect on our overall cost of goods sold 
however  there is no assurance that our raw materials will not be significantly adversely affected in the future  causing our profitability to be reduced 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
our products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs  and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of our products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although we believe that all of our products are safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
we conduct research and test the formulation and production of our products  but we have performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because we are highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety  and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  we could be adversely affected in the event that those products prove or are asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with any illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of our products or similar products of our competitors 
as a manufacturer  we may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and a distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  we could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of these products involves the risk of injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  we have not been a party to any product liability litigation  although  like any dietary supplement company  we have received reports from individuals who have asserted that they 
table of contents suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products 
the number of reports we have received to date is nominal 
these matters historically have been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we are aware of no instance in which any of our products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance  which we believe to be adequate for our needs  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to such claims in the future or that our insurance coverage will be adequate 
our business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
most of our products are not protected by patents 
the labeling regulations governing our nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products  as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and the interactions among various substances 
in this respect  we maintain an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer  and more effective formulations of our products 
we protect our investment in research  as well as the techniques we use to improve the purity and effectiveness of our products  by relying on trade secret laws 
we have also entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  we endeavor to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for our products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada  and in many of the other countries in which we are either presently operating or plan to commence operations in the future 
notwithstanding our efforts  there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us for infringement of their intellectual proprietary rights 
if an infringement claim is asserted  we may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis  or terminate our manufacturing and marketing of our infringing products 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or operating results 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we manufacture approximately of the products sold to our customers at our salt lake city location 
as a result  we are dependent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities 
those operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure  or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facility would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste  and other toxic and hazardous materials 
our manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by us that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations  and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities  or of satisfying new 
table of contents legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
a failure of our information technology systems would harm our business 
the global nature of our business and our seamless global compensation plan requires the development and implementation of robust and efficiently functioning information technology systems 
such systems are vulnerable to a variety of potential risks  including damage or interruption resulting from natural disasters and telecommunication failures and human error or intentional acts of sabotage  vandalism  break ins and similar acts 
although we have adopted and implemented a business continuity and disaster recovery plan  which includes routine back up  off site archiving and storage  and certain redundancies  the occurrence of any of these events could result in costly interruptions or failures adversely affecting our business and the results of our operations 
we may incur liability under our athlete guarantee program  if and to the extent participating athletes make a successful claim against usana for testing positive for certain banned substances while taking usana nutritional supplements 
usana believes that its nutritional supplement products are free from substances that have been banned by world class training and competitive athletic programs 
the company retains independent testing agencies to conduct periodic checks for banned substances 
the company further believes that  while its products promote good health  they are not otherwise considered to be performance enhancing as that term has been used in defining substances that are banned from use in international competition by the world anti doping agency wada 
for many years  usana has been a sponsor of olympic athletes and professional competitors around the world 
these athletes have been tested on many occasions and have never tested positive for banned substances as a result of taking usana nutritional products 
to back up its claim that athletes who use the company s products as part of their training regimen will not be consuming banned substances  the company has offered to enter into agreements with select athletes  some of whom have high profiles and are highly compensated  which state that  during the term of the agreement  should the athlete test positive for a banned substance included in the wada  and should such positive result be the result of taking usana nutritional products  usana will compensate that athlete two times their current annual earnings up to one million dollars  based on the athlete s personal level of competition  endorsement  and other income  as well as other factors 
to mitigate potential exposure under these agreements  we designate lots identified as dedicated to the athlete guarantee program and retain additional samples  store designated lot samples externally with a third party  and establish a chain of custody that requires signatures on behalf of usana and the third party to transfer possession of the product lots and that restricts access by usana employees after the transfer 
all applicants to this athlete guarantee program are subject to screening and acceptance by the company in its sole discretion 
contracts are tailored to fit the athlete s individual circumstances and the amount of the company s exposure is limited based on the level of sponsorship of the participating athlete 
although the company believes that the pool of current and potential participants in the program is small  there is no guarantee that an athlete who is accepted in the program will not successfully make a claim against us 
the company currently has no insurance to protect it from potential claims under this program 
based on the mitigating factors  screening process and the company s view that its products are not performance enhancing  management believes there is a less than remote chance that the company will incur a liability under the athlete guarantee program

table of contents this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop and manufacture high quality  science based nutritional and personal care products that are distributed internationally through a network marketing system  which is a form of direct selling 
our customer base comprises two types of customer associates and preferred customers 
associates are independent distributors of our products who also purchase our products for their personal use 
preferred customers purchase our products strictly for their personal use and are not permitted to resell or to distribute the products 
as of december   we had approximately  active associates and approximately  active preferred customers worldwide 
we have ongoing operations in markets  which are grouped and presented as follows north america united states including direct sales from the united states to the united kingdom and the netherlands canada mexico asia pacific southeast asia pacific australia  new zealand  singapore  malaysia  and the philippines greater china hong kong  taiwan  and china north asia japan and south korea additionally  in we will expand our business to thailand  france  and belgium 
thailand will be grouped into southeast asia pacific  and north america will become our north america europe region 
because we have operations in multiple markets  with sales and expenses being generated and incurred in multiple currencies  our reported us dollar sales and earnings can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in general  net sales  gross profit margins  and earnings are affected positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
currency fluctuations  however  have the opposite effect on our associate incentives and selling  general and administrative expenses 
customers because we utilize a direct selling model for the distribution of our products the success and growth of our business is primarily based on our ability to attract new and retain existing associates to sell and consume our products 
notably  sales to associates account for the majority of our product sales and represented of product sales during changes in our product sales are typically the result of variations in product sales volume relating to fluctuations in the number of active associates and preferred customers purchasing our products 
the number of active associates and preferred customers is  therefore  used by management as a key non financial measure 
the following tables summarize the changes in our active customer base by geographic region 
these numbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand as of the dates indicated 
for purposes of this report  we only count as active customers those associates and preferred customers who have our business in china is that of babycare  our wholly owned subsidiary

the preferred customer count previously reported for our china operations was  which brought the preferred customer count for greater china to  these numbers have been corrected to  for our china operations  and  for greater china 
this correction represents a change of  to total preferred customers reported as of january  recent developments in addition to preparing for entry into thailand  france  and belgium  during  we continued integrating our china operations into our business 
we introduced several usana products for sale in china  and continued educating our associates on our china compensation plan to help them understand how to appropriately grow in this market 
additionally  we continued to make progress on obtaining additional provincial direct selling licenses 

table of contents in  we also began implementing a strategy to stabilize and grow our north america region 
this strategy is centered on a number of key initiatives  including i strengthening the partnership between usana and its north american associates  ii developing the leadership and marketing skills of our associates  iii personalizing our products  technologies and systems to meet the individual needs of our associates  iv innovating to develop new products and technologies  and v offering north america specific incentives and promotions 
to develop and support these initiatives  we have expanded our corporate and management team 
while this is a long term strategy that will require upfront investment and patience  we believe that our successful execution of this strategy could produce results as early as the fourth quarter of additionally  we believe our entry into the france and belgium markets will encourage north american associates to expand their businesses 
presentation product sales and the shipping and handling fees billed to our customers are recorded as revenue net of applicable sales discounts when the product is delivered  title has transferred  and the risk of loss passes to the customer 
payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
also reflected in net sales is a provision for product returns and allowances  which is estimated based on our historical experience 
additionally  the company collects an annual renewal fee from associates that is deferred on receipt and is recognized as income on a straight line basis over a twelve month period 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance  and overhead costs that are directly associated with the production and distribution of our products and sales materials  as well as duties and taxes that are associated with the import and export of our products 
as our international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales are increasingly affected by additional duties  freight  and other factors  such as changes in currency exchange rates 
associate incentives expense includes all forms of commissions  compensation  and other incentives paid to our associates 
compensation paid to our china associates  although under a different compensation plan  is also included in associate incentives expense 
incentives paid to associates include bonuses earned  rewards from contests and promotions  and base commissions  which makes up the majority of our associate incentives expense 
bonuses are paid out to associates based on certain business growth criteria  total base commission earnings  and leadership level 
contests and promotions are offered as an incentive and reward to our associates and are typically paid out only after an associate achieves specific growth and advancement levels 
base commissions are paid out on the sale of products 
associates earn their commissions based on sales volume points that are generated in their down line organization 
sales volume points are assigned to each commissionable product and comprise a certain percent of the product price 
items such as our starter kits and sales tools have no sales volume point value  and commissions are not paid on the sale of these items 
although insignificant to our financial statements  an associate may earn commissions on sales volume points that are generated from personal purchases that are not considered to be part of their qualifying purchases 
qualifying purchases are the amount of product that associates must purchase each month  which they must either resell to consumers or personally use in order to qualify to earn commissions or bonuses under usana s compensation plan 
commissions paid to associates on personal purchases are considered a sales discount and are reported as a reduction to our net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  associate event costs  advertising  professional fees  marketing  and research and development expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
significant depreciation and amortization expense is incurred as a result of investments in physical facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment  and systems to support our international operations 

table of contents sales to customers outside the united states are transacted in the respective local currencies and are translated to us dollars at weighted average currency exchange rates for each monthly accounting period to which they relate 
most of our raw material purchases from suppliers and our product purchases from third party manufacturers are transacted in us dollars 
consequently  our sales and net earnings are affected by changes in currency exchange rates  with sales and earnings generally increasing with a weakening us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
in our net sales discussions that follow  we approximate the impact of currency fluctuations on net sales by translating current year net sales at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year periods 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percent of net sales  respectively  for the periods indicated fiscal year consolidated statements of earnings data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses associate incentives selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings summary of financial results net sales increased  or million  to million in  when compared with this increase is largely due to strong sales growth in certain markets within our asia pacific region and includes a full year of our china operations  compared with only partial results in net sales during also benefited from favorable changes in currency exchange rates by approximately million  without which net sales would have increased 
notably  all of the benefit we received from favorable changes in currency exchange rates took place over the first three quarters in changes in currency exchange rates in may negatively impact net sales and produce more difficult year over year comparables for our operating results 
net earnings increased  or million  to million in  when compared with this increase was the result of improved gross profit margins on higher net sales  offset in most part by an increase in associate incentives and selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales the following table summarizes the changes in our net sales by geographic region for the fiscal years ended january  and december  net sales by region in thousands year ended approximate impact of currency exchange change excluding the impact of currency change from prior year percent change north america united states    n a canada mexico north america total asia pacific southeast asia pacific greater china north asia asia pacific total north america the decrease in local currency net sales in this region was the result of lower product sales volume due to a decrease in the average number of active associates in this region throughout the year 
we believe that this decrease in associates is predominantly due to difficult economic conditions in north america  coupled with the changes that we made to the commission qualification requirements under our compensation plan in the third quarter of the intent of these changes was to incent more entrepreneurial associates to join the company and build a sales organization at an accelerated pace 
while the changes have caused us to enroll more entrepreneurial associates  they have made it more challenging for us to enroll associates in general  including those who simply consume our products and are less entrepreneurial  particularly in north america 
this decrease in active associates was partially offset by an increase in average spending per associate on a year over year basis  which is also due to the commission qualification changes for new associates 
asia pacific the increase in net sales in this region came from hong kong and our emerging markets  which included china  the philippines  and south korea 
growth in these markets resulted primarily from higher product sales volume  which was due mostly to an increase in the average number of active associates throughout the year 
net sales in hong kong increased to million in  compared with notably  most of this growth was generated during the first half of the year 
in addition to an increase in the average number of associates purchasing  this sales growth was aided by several other events that took place in hong kong during these events included i recognition of deferred revenue in the first quarter due to a promotion that ended on the final day of  ii a price increase and a surge in sales related to the anticipation of this increase in the first quarter  iii a surge in sales ahead of anticipated policy changes during the second quarter  and iv a larger than expected surge in sales in the fourth quarter from a successful promotion that we offered during december 
setting aside some of the events that aided hong kong s growth in  and in light of our continued focus on growing our mainland china market  we believe that hong kong s performance in will be more in line with its results for the third quarter of  or approximately million in net sales per quarter 

table of contents although hong kong s net sales increased in  the number of active associates in hong kong began to decrease during the last half of the year 
hong kong had  active associates at december   which is a decrease from the same period of the prior year 
similar to north america  however  an increase in average spending per associate in hong kong  resulting primarily from our commission qualification changes in  has helped to offset the effect on sales of the decline in active associates in this market 
net sales in china increased to million in  compared with this increase is due partially to a comparison of china s full year of operations in with a partial year of operations in  as we acquired our china operations in august net sales in the philippines increased to million in  compared with  and net sales in south korea increased to million 
growth in these markets resulted from higher product sales volume  which was due primarily to an increase in the average number of active associates throughout the year 
gross profit the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales can primarily be attributed to currency benefits received from our international subsidiaries  as the majority of our products sold are manufactured at our corporate headquarters in the united states and transferred to our international subsidiaries 
gross profit also benefitted from lower relative freight costs on shipments to our customers  price increases in hong kong  and leverage gained on higher net sales 
in  we expect gross profit to be modestly reduced from costs increases on certain of our raw materials and strengthening of the us dollar 
associate incentives the increase in associate incentives as a percent of net sales can mostly be attributed to an increased payout under our matching bonus program 
a higher payout of base commissions under our associate compensation plan and the impact of currency fluctuations also contributed to the increase in associate incentives as a percent of net sales 
partially offsetting these increases were i the inclusion of china in our operating results for a full year  compared with a partial year in  as the relative payout under the china compensation plan is lower than the payout under the usana compensation plan  and ii certain initiatives that the company put in place in the second quarter of to manage associate incentives as a percent of net sales 
in  we expect associate incentives to be modestly lower than in as a result of price increases and commission payout adjustments that we have made in certain markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of net sales can primarily be attributed to the inclusion of china in our operating results for a full year  compared with a partial year in our china operations currently carry significantly higher selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales that our other markets  and also to expenses associated with our increased branding efforts 
this increase was partially offset by leverage gained on increased sales outside the united states in our markets where selling  general and administrative expenses are lower 
in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  compared with the most significant components of this increase in absolute terms were as follows added costs from china s operations of approximately million  an increase related to our corporate branding efforts of approximately million  
table of contents an increase in credit card processing and bank fees of approximately million  and an increase in travel costs of approximately million 
although reflected in some of the above items  changes in currency added approximately million to overall selling  general and administrative expenses 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease of million in babycare acquisition costs compared with the prior year 
in  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute and relative terms due to increased spending to support our north america growth strategy  as well as to added costs related to our entry into three new markets during fiscal other income expense other income decreased by million due to lower currency exchange gains on intercompany transactions during the year 
income taxes income taxes were of earnings before income taxes in  compared to in the income tax rate for was lower due to tax benefits related to changes in uncertain income tax positions  larger prior year tax benefits  and the level of equity award exercises 
diluted earnings per share while net earnings increased  diluted earnings per share increased to 
the increase in diluted earnings per share can be attributed to increased net earnings and a lower number of diluted shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during summary of financial results net sales increased million to million in  which was an increase from the most significant item impacting net sales during was an increase in product sales volumes  which resulted from an increase in the number of active associates in greater china  partially offset by a decrease in the number of active associates in north america and southeast asia pacific 
this increase included the addition of million in net sales from our china operations  which were acquired in august net sales during also benefited from favorable changes in currency exchange rates by approximately million 
net earnings increased to million in from million in this year over year increase was primarily the result of higher net sales  improved gross profit margin  and a lower effective tax rate 
these improvements were partially offset by a basis point increase in associate incentives as a percent of net sales  and a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our acquisition in china reduced net earnings in by approximately million  which includes million of acquisition costs

as a manufacturer of premium products  we believe that continued economic challenges  particularly in the consumer products segment  contributed meaningfully to the decrease in active associates and preferred customers 
part of the decrease in the number of active associates was also due to an increase in the number of north america based associates building their businesses in asia  which results in growth in sales and associates in asia pacific rather than north america 
the decrease in active associates throughout was partially offset by an increase in customer spending  which was a result of two factors 
first  in we changed the structure of our compensation  recognition  and rewards programs in a way that we believed would encourage our associates to build their businesses more effectively 
we believe that these changes were the primary reason for the increase in product sales volume per customer from to second  we implemented certain price increases in the few years leading up to and through  including a price increase of nearly ten percent on our products in mexico 
while our profitability in mexico improved  we believe that the price increases in this market contributed to the decline in our active associate count 
asia pacific the increase in net sales in this region was primarily due to higher product sales volume due to an increase in the number of active associates 
this increase came predominantly from greater china 
growth in greater china was led by hong kong  where the number of active associates increased year over year and net sales increased 
additionally  our acquisition in china added approximately million in net sales   active associates  and  active preferred customers to this region 
excluding our china operations  local currency net sales in this region increased  the number of active associates increased  and the number of active preferred customers remained unchanged 
although smaller as a percent of sales  we also experienced double digit local currency sales growth in the philippines and south korea 
the increase in total asia pacific sales  on a local currency 
table of contents basis  was partially offset by an overall decline in sales and associates in southeast asia pacific  which we believe  similar to north america  is largely the result of difficult economic conditions 
gross profit the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales from to can be attributed to a decrease in overall raw materials cost  currency benefits  lower relative freight costs on shipments to our customers  production and shipping efficiency due to capital investments  and leverage gained on increased net sales 
additionally  we have implemented certain price increases  notably on some of our larger packs and flagship products  and we discontinued several of our lower gross margin product pack offerings  all of which contributed to our improved gross profit 
associate incentives associate incentives as a percent of net sales increased slightly from to notably  during the second quarter of  we implemented a strategic initiative to reduce associate incentives expense as a percent of net sales 
changes implemented under this initiative were the primary reason that associate incentives as a percentage of net sales only increased basis points for the full year  when compared with selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales from to was primarily due to acquisition costs related to our china subsidiary 
in absolute terms  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in  compared with the most significant components of this increase in absolute terms were as follows an increase in wage related expenses of approximately million  which includes million of expenses related to our china operations  acquisition costs related to our china operations of approximately million  expenses related to our asia pacific convention of approximately million  and an increase in credit card fees of approximately million related to the increase in sales 
other income expense other income increased nearly million due to a million reduction in interest expense as a result of a lower average balance on our line of credit during the year 
income taxes income taxes totaled of earnings before income taxes in  compared to in this decrease is primarily due to increased tax benefits from the deduction for qualified production activities and tax benefits recognized from stock option exercises in diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share increased  or  to for the year

table of contents we may experience variations in the results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of factors that include the following the recruiting and retention of associates and preferred customers  the opening of new markets  the timing of company sponsored events  contests  and promotions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  new product introductions  the timing of holidays  which may reduce the amount of time that our associates spend selling products or recruiting new associates  the negative impact of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict the sale of certain products in some countries  the adverse effect of a failure by us or an associate or allegations of such failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations  the integration and operation of new information technology systems  the inability to introduce new products or the introduction of new products by competitors  entry into one or more of our markets by competitors  availability of raw materials  general conditions in the nutritional supplement  personal care  and weight management industries or the network marketing industry  and consumer perceptions of our products and operations 
because our products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  we are highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality  and efficacy of our products and nutritional supplements in general 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more of our products or of other products that are similar to our products could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  quarterly revenues  expenses  and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase revenues in future periods or be able to sustain the level of revenue or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis that we have sustained in the past 
due to the foregoing factors  future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if that occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements by using both net cash flow from operations and by drawing from our line of credit 
our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow 
there are currently no material restrictions on our ability to transfer and remit funds among our international markets 
repatriation of funds that are related to earnings considered permanently reinvested in certain of our markets would not result in a tax liability that would have a material impact on our liquidity 

table of contents operating cash flow we typically generate positive cash flow due to our strong operating margins 
net cash flow from operating activities totaled million in  compared with million in the most significant components of this increase were an improvement to net earnings in compared with  and a change in prepaid expenses and other current assets from to  which was the result of i a term deposit from our acquisition of babycare in that matured in  ii an increase in federal income taxes receivable in  and iii an increase in deferred commissions in related to an increase in deferred revenue from a successful promotion in hong kong that ended the final day of partially offsetting the increase in cash flow from operating activities was  on a comparative basis  the change in other liabilities related to increases in deferred revenue  accrued associate incentives and employee compensation  as well as a change in deferred income taxes which was primarily due to higher stock option exercises in and the impact of currency translation in as a us based  multi national company  reporting in us dollars  our net sales and earnings can be significantly affected by changes in currency exchange rates and it is difficult to estimate the impact that these changes may have on our future operating results 
in general  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in the countries where we have operations 
during  we received a benefit to net sales of approximately million related to changes in currency exchange rates 
notably  however  this benefit took place during the first nine months of in changes in currency exchange rates may negatively impact net sales and produce more difficult year over year comparables for our operating results 
line of credit we have a long standing relationship with bank of america 
for the last few years  we have maintained a million credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement with bank of america 
during the second quarter of we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  which  among other things  extends the term of our credit facility through april and increases the amount that we may borrow under the credit facility to million 
we have not drawn on this line of credit since it was amended in the second quarter  and  as of december  there was no outstanding balance on this line of credit 
the agreement for this new credit facility contains restrictive covenants  which require us to maintain a consolidated rolling four quarter adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda equal to or greater than million  and a ratio of consolidated funded debt to adjusted ebitda of to at the end of each quarter 
the adjusted ebitda under this agreement is modified for certain non cash expenses 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
management is not aware of any issues currently impacting bank of america s ability to honor their commitment to extend credit under this facility 
working capital cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december   from million at january  of the million held at december   million was held in the united states  and million was held by international subsidiaries 
of the million held at january   million was held in the united states  and was held by international subsidiaries 
net working capital increased to million at december   from million at january  this increase in net working capital was due mostly to net cash provided by operating activities  which was offset in large part by share repurchases as discussed below  and also purchases of property and equipment

table of contents and maintenance for expanded reporting capabilities and increased production efficiency  build out at our corporate headquarters for the manufacture of our sens products  purchase of equipment for expanded and improved production efficiencies  and the purchase and installation of solar panels at our corporate headquarters facility 
we anticipate capital expenditures between million and million during  which will include further it related investments and purchases of equipment for improved production efficiencies and to support our personalization strategy  as well as investments related to the opening of our new markets in share repurchase we have a share repurchase plan that has been ongoing since the fourth quarter of our board of directors has periodically approved additional dollar amounts for share repurchases under that plan 
share repurchases are made from time to time  in the open market  through block trades or otherwise  and are based on market conditions  the level of our cash balances  general business opportunities  and other factors 
during  we repurchased and retired million shares of common stock for a total investment of million  at an average market price of per share 
also during  our board of directors authorized an additional million for share repurchases under the plan 
as of december   the remaining approved repurchase amount under the plan was million and there is no requirement for future share repurchases 
summary we believe that current cash balances  future cash provided by operations  and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to cover our operating and capital needs in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future 
if we experience an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
no assurance can be given  however  that additional financing  if required  would be available or on favorable terms 
we might also require or seek additional financing for the purpose of expanding new markets  growing our existing markets  or for other reasons 
such financing may include the use of additional debt or the sale of additional equity securities 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to our existing shareholders 
contractual obligations and commercial contingencies the following table summarizes our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases capital commitments other commitments purchase obligations line of credit total contractual obligations operating leases generally provide that property taxes  insurance  and maintenance expenses are the responsibility of the company 
such expenses are not included in the operating lease amounts that are outlined in the table above 

table of contents other commitments include consulting and it related services  corporate and athlete sponsorships  facility maintenance  services related to the events that we hold for our associates both locally and internationally  and uncertain tax positions 
additionally  throughout the year we will enter into various short term contracts  mostly for services related to events that we hold for our associates 
the line of credit has a maturity date of april although we currently have no balance outstanding on this line of credit  fees on the unused portion of this line are due periodically and are reflected in the table above 
if we utilize this line of credit prior to its maturity  we will be required to pay it in full at maturity 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements herein 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
those estimates and assumptions are derived and are continually evaluated based on our historical experiences  current facts and circumstances  and on changes in the business environment 
actual results  however  may sometimes differ materially from estimates under different conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as both those that are material to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most subjective judgments 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the estimated point of delivery of the merchandise  at which point the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
revenue is realizable when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
we require cash or credit card payment prior to shipping and do not extend credit to customers 
payments received for undelivered products are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in other current liabilities 
a provision for product returns and allowances is established and is based on our historical experience 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as revenue 
commissions paid to an associate on his or her own orders are captured and reported as a reduction to net sales in the form of a sales discount 
management estimates  based on the structure of usana s compensation plan  that an associate who places an order with sales volume points in a personal sales position will eventually be paid commission on that purchase 
such reduction of revenue for associates outside of the united states is converted to us dollars at the average currency exchange rate for the applicable period 
we collect an annual renewal fee from our associates that is deferred when it is collected and is recognized as income on a straight line basis over the subsequent twelve month period 

table of contents inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor  and overhead 
inventories are assessed to ensure that they are valued at estimated market value using various assumptions in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning  and market conditions 
a change in any of these variables could result in an adjustment to inventory 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value 
events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include  among other factors operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines  technological developments resulting in obsolescence  changes in demand for products manufactured  changes in competition and competitive practices  uncertainties associated with the world economies  and changes in governmental regulations or actions 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair market value of identifiable net assets of companies acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather it is tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
the determination of impairment is made at the reporting unit level and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
during the third quarter ended october   the company early adopted new guidance which simplifies the goodwill impairment test by allowing the option to first assess qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
some of these qualitative factors may include macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  a change in financial performance  entity specific events  a sustained decrease in share price  and consideration of the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of a reporting unit as determined in the most recent quantitative assessment 
if  through this qualitative assessment  the conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  a two step impairment analysis is performed to estimate the fair value of goodwill  primarily using the discounted cash flow model  known as the income approach 
the income approach requires the use of estimates and assumptions in projecting future operating results and related cash flows 
the first step involves testing for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair values of reporting units 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step one  less fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
fair value of each of the reporting units at december  was greater than the carrying amount  therefore  no impairment was recorded 
other intangible assets represent definite lived and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchase of our china operations on august  these intangible assets have been measured at the acquisition date fair value using various methodologies applied within the income approach 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their related useful lives and are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  however  they are tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances that have occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the indefinite lived assets that would indicate impairment 

table of contents determining the fair value of our intangible assets requires significant judgment in estimates and assumptions used under the income approach 
a change in any of the estimates or assumptions used could result in an impairment 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are calculated in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences for items treated differently for tax and financial reporting 
tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
additional information regarding income taxes is available in note e to the consolidated financial statements herein 
on an interim basis  an estimate is made of what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year  and a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated effective rate is recorded 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this estimation process periodically results in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
equity based compensation 
we record compensation expense in the financial statements for equity based awards based on the grant date fair value and an estimate of forfeitures derived from historical experience 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards 
equity based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
for more information regarding the assumptions and estimates used in calculating this equity based compensation expense  see note l to the consolidated financial statements herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates  and other uncertainties that are inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks that are associated with changes in social  political  and economic conditions in our international operations 
this includes changes in the laws and policies that govern investment in international countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  to changes in united states laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 
foreign currency risks 
net sales outside the united states represented   and of our net sales in   and respectively 
because a significant portion of our sales are generated outside the united states  currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on our sales and earnings 
this risk is partially mitigated by the fact that our sales are spread across markets  with hong kong where the local currency is tied to the us dollar being our largest international market  at of net sales in  followed by canada at 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  with all revenue and expenses being translated at weighted average currency exchange rates for the applicable periods 
in general  our reported sales and earnings are affected positively by a weakening of the us dollar and negatively by a strengthening of the us dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect our product margins  because we manufacture the majority of our products in the us and sell them to our 
table of contents international subsidiaries in their respective functional currencies 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our future business  results of operations  or financial condition 
this is due to the uncertainty in  and the varying degrees and type of exposure that we face from  fluctuation of various currencies 
currently our strategy for reducing our exposure to currency fluctuation includes the timely and efficient repatriation of earnings from international markets and settlement of intercompany transactions 
at times in the past we have sought to reduce exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of currency exchange contracts on cash that we repatriate and we may look to something like this again in the coming year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
there can be no assurance that our practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks that may be encountered in connection with our currency transactions 
as of december   we had no currency exchange contracts in place 
following are the average exchange rates of currency units to one us dollar for each of the international markets in which we operated as of december  for the quarterly periods indicated first second third fourth first second third fourth canadian dollar australian dollar new zealand dollar hong kong dollar japanese yen new taiwan dollar korean won singapore dollar mexican peso chinese yuan malaysian ringitt philippine peso interest rate risks 
as of december   we had no outstanding debt  and therefore  we have no direct exposure to interest rate risk 
it may become necessary to borrow in the future in order to meet our financing needs 
in the event that it becomes necessary to borrow  there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow  or at favorable rates
