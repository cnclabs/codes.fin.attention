item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of kennametal inc and the related financial statement notes 
unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc delivers productivity to customers seeking peak performance in demanding environments by providing innovative custom and standard wear resistant solutions 
to provide these solutions  we harness our knowledge of advanced materials and application development with a commitment to environmental sustainability 
our solutions are built around industry essential technology platforms 
these include metalworking tools  engineered components and surface technologies that are mission critical to the performance of our customers battling extreme conditions such as fatigue wear  corrosion and high temperatures 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence  as well as our technological expertise and innovation we deliver in our products and services  help us to achieve a leading position in our primary markets 
we believe that we are one of the largest global providers of consumable metalcutting tools and tooling supplies 
in  the company achieved year over year sales growth each quarter  with an organic sales increase of percent for the year 
organic sales growth includes both volume and price 
the company had strong earnings per diluted share eps of as a result of sales growth and solid operating margins due to price realization and operating expense control 
we have also reduced our cost structure by approximately million annually  due to our previous restructuring programs 
for  sales were  million  an increase of percent compared to prior year sales of  million 
operating income was million  an increase of million compared to operating income of million in the increase in operating income was driven by higher sales volume  pricing and lower employment and restructuring costs  partially offset by higher raw material costs and acquisition related costs 
operating income included million of net acquisition related costs 
we consumed higher cost raw materials in  as raw material costs significantly increased during the first half of the year 
the price of raw materials has remained stable throughout the second half of the fiscal year 
we executed appropriate pricing earlier in the year and have continued to maintain our cost discipline throughout realized raw materials costs generally lag the fluctuation in market prices by a quarter 
we continue to monitor changes in raw materials costs to ensure appropriate pricing 
in march we acquired all of the shares of deloro stellite holdings limited stellite for a purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
the united kingdom based stellite is a global manufacturer and provider of alloy based critical wear solutions for extreme environments involving high temperature  corrosion and abrasion 
stellite s proprietary metal alloys  materials expertise  engineering design and fabrication capabilities complement kennametal s current business in the oil and gas  power generation  transportation and aerospace end markets 
the stellite acquisition generated approximately million of goodwill  based on the final purchase price allocations  which is not deductible for tax purposes and is attributable to the operating synergies we expect to gain from the acquisition 
this acquisition is in alignment with our growth strategy and positions us to further achieve geographic and end market balance 
the company s restructuring programs completed in fiscal are delivering annual ongoing pre tax savings of approximately million 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million in the current year 
we have actively managed our business portfolio by investing approximately million in the stellite acquisition  returning over million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  repurchasing approximately million shares  and increasing our dividend by percent in october in addition we made capital expenditures of million during the year 
in addition  we invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering a high level of new products to our customers 
research and development expenses included in operating expense totaled million for in  we generated approximately percent of our sales from new products 
results of continuing operations sales sales of  million in increased percent from  million in as a result of strong organic growth of percent  business acquisition contribution of percent and percent more business days in organic sales increased in both segments and across most regions 
organic sales growth drivers were energy markets of percent  aerospace and defense of percent  earthworks of percent  general engineering of percent and transportation of percent 

table of contents sales of  million in increased percent from  million in as a result of strong organic growth 
organic sales increased in both segments and across all regions 
organic sales growth drivers were general engineering of percent  transportation of percent and energy of percent 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an organic sales increase of million  million related to the stellite acquisition and cost reduction benefits  partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable business segment mix 
the gross profit margin for decreased to percent from percent in due primarily to the stellite acquisition 
gross profit increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increased organic sales of million  improved absorption of manufacturing costs due to higher production levels  cost reduction benefits  favorable business mix and favorable foreign currency effects of million 
the impact of these items was partially offset by higher raw material costs and one time benefits in the prior year from certain labor negotiations in europe that did not occur in the current period 
the gross profit margin for increased to percent from percent in operating expense operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase is primarily due to additional operating expenditures related to the stellite acquisition of million  acquisition related costs of million  and higher depreciation of million due to a full year of depreciation related to the enterprise resource planning erp system upgrade in  partially offset by a decrease in restructuring related charges of million and lower employment costs 
operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase is primarily driven by higher employment costs of million due to the reinstatement of salaries and other temporary employment cost reductions and a higher provision for incentive compensation of million  as a result of better operating performance 
foreign currency unfavorably impacted operating expense by million 
restructuring charges during  there were no restructuring charges 
during  we completed our restructuring programs to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies

restructuring related charges of million were recorded in cost of goods sold and million in operating expense during we realized pre tax benefits from these restructuring programs of approximately million during during  we continued to implement restructuring actions and recognized million of restructuring charges of which million were recorded as restructuring charges including million related to inventory disposals and recorded in cost of goods sold 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of amortization expense in of million or percent was primarily due to the stellite acquisition 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million in  compared with million in due to increased borrowings to fund the stellite acquisition  primarily under our revolving credit facility  as well as the new million bond issuance in february which overlapped the maturity date of june for the old bond issuance 
the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to a decrease in the average interest rates on domestic borrowings to percent  compared to percent in  partially offset by higher borrowings 
the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
other income expense  net in  other income  net was million compared to other expense  net of million in the change was primarily due to favorable foreign currency transactions gains of million 
in  other expense  net decreased by million to other expense  net of million compared to other income  net of million in the decrease was primarily due to a million unfavorable change in foreign currency transaction results  primarily driven by the euro 

table of contents income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by the release of a valuation allowance in the netherlands and effective settlement of uncertain tax positions in the us  europe and asia 
the effect of these items was partially offset by increased income in the us where the tax rate is higher than most international locations and non deductible acquisition related costs 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by increased income in international locations where the tax rate is lower than the us as well as restructuring charges in the prior year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be recognized 
the effective rate was favorably impacted by a million release of a valuation allowance in the united kingdom  but that impact was offset by the tax cost of approximately million  predominately us  associated with dividends of current year net income from some of our international subsidiaries 
the effective rate was unfavorably impacted by the expiration of the research  development and experimental tax credit as well as the impact of restructuring charges in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be recognized 
during  we generated taxable income in other jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the corresponding impact on the effective tax rate was immaterial 
in conjunction with our annual planning process during the fourth quarter of  we determined that sustainability of future income in the united kingdom is likely  and as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the net deferred tax assets in this jurisdiction 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance adjustment of million that reduced tax expense 
with respect to the other jurisdictions  we believe sustainability of future income remains uncertain 
we therefore have not adjusted the valuation allowance in these jurisdictions 
we will continue to monitor our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions  and if appropriate  will adjust the valuation allowance 
such an adjustment would likely result in a material reduction to tax expense in the period the adjustment occurs

table of contents effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs  including the cost of certain raw materials  continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all stock option awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for certain employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on investment grade bond yield curves with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would increase or decrease  respectively  our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care cost increases is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would be immaterial to our pre tax income 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
we expect to contribute million and million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  in allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 
income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain  in part  due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  pension benefits  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required 
in the event we were to determine that we are able to use our deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance had been recorded against the deferred tax assets  a decrease in the valuation allowance would be required 

table of contents new accounting standards adopted as of january   kennametal adopted changes to fair value measurements and disclosure 
many of the amendments in this guidance represent clarifications to existing guidance or changes in the measurement guidance for determining fair value 
the most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for level measurements 
disclosures will be required about the use of a nonfinancial asset measured or disclosed at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use 
in addition  entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed 
the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
issued in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july   with early adoption is permitted 
in december  the fasb deferred the requirement to present reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
companies would still be required to adopt the other requirements contained in the accounting guidance on presentation of other comprehensive income 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july  in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements 
each component of net income and other comprehensive income  together with totals for comprehensive income and its two parts  net income and other comprehensive income  would need to be displayed under either alternative 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july  in september  the fasb issued additional guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for kennametal beginning july  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and  therefore  hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income expense  net 
see notes and set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 

table of contents cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have received immaterial amounts at june  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these contracts 
we would have paid immaterial amounts at june  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these contracts 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would have changed accumulated other comprehensive loss income  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates  while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap contracts to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
we had forward starting interest rate swap contracts outstanding for forecasted transactions that effectively converted a cumulative notional amount of million from floating to fixed interest rates as of june  in february  we settled forward starting interest rate swap contracts to convert this million of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
upon settlement  we made a cash payment of million 
the loss is being amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method 
we would have paid million at june  to settle these interest rate swap contracts  which represented the fair value of these contracts 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding debt  including capital leases and notes payable 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of termination settlement of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
on february   we issued million of percent senior unsecured notes due in interest will be paid semi annually on february and august of each year 
we settled forward starting interest rate swap contracts related to the bond issuance as further discussed in note set forth in item we applied the net proceeds from this notes offering to the repayment of our percent senior unsecured notes on their june  maturity date 
on october   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
the new five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes and extends to october we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of june  also during july  the company completed the issuance of million shares of its common stock generating net proceeds of million which were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations materially decreased diluted earnings per share by in and by in and materially increased diluted earnings per share in by 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
