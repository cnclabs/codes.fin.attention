critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements  and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include the collection of accounts receivable  and the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories and the provisions for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this form k reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred upon shipment or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes the sales of automobiles upon delivery and acceptance by the customers and where collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue related to financing services is recognized ratably over the financing period 
service fees for graphical advertisements on the company s websites are charged on a fixed fee basis 
the company recognizes the advertising revenue when the service is performed over the service term 
the company charges a monthly fee for listing services and recognizes the revenue when services are performed 
the company offers sales incentives to its customers in the form of i subscription exemptions  ii discounted prices and iii free advertisements 
the company classifies sales incentives as a reduction of net revenues 
revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized ratably over the service periods 
the company recognizes revenue from automobile value added services when such services are performed 
receivables related to financing services we record a receivable related to financing services when cash is loaned to customers to finance their purchases of automobiles 
upon repayments by customers  we record the amounts as reductions of receivables related to financing services 
receivables related to financing services represents the aggregate outstanding balance of loans from customers related to their purchases of automobiles and are considered receivables held for investment 
we charge a fee for providing loan services and such fee is prepaid by customers 
we amortize these fees over the receivable term  which is typically days  using the straight line method 
we record such amortized amounts as financing fee income and the unamortized amount is classified as deferred revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables at the end of each of the reporting periods and make estimates for potential credit losses 
we have not experienced any losses on our accounts receivable historically 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventory  assessing slow moving and ongoing products 
our products are comprised of the purchase cost of automobiles which declines in value over time 
we continuously evaluate our inventory to determine the reserve amount for slow moving inventory 
income taxes in the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the deferred tax assets amounting to  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  advertising expenses carryforwards and allowance for doubtful accounts are not more likely than not to be realized and a full amount of valuation allowance has been provided 
the company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to its international subsidiaries as they are to be reinvested indefinitely 
these earnings relate to ongoing operations and are approximately million as of december  because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested 
the company has no material uncertain tax positions as of december  or unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company classifies interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   there are no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment we perform our impairment tests for goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors  including industry and economic trends and changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
during the year ended december   due to the planned closing of goodcar s operations related to sales of vip membership cards and other promotion services  which is a reporting unit under our automobile value added services segment  we reevaluated our goodwill and intangible assets related to this reporting unit and determined that the related goodwill and intangible assets were impaired 
we recorded impairment losses of  and   after tax in respect of our goodwill and intangible assets related to this reporting unit for the year ended december  except for this reporting unit  there was no indication that the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets related to other reporting units may not be recoverable based on the result of our evaluation

the company will continue to maintain close working relationships with its top customers while attempting to reduce the concentration of revenues among these top customers actively looking for new customers to enlarge its customer base

the company earns a service fee from its customers for drawing its facility lines of credit related to its customers purchases of automobiles and payment of import taxes 
customers bear all the interest and fees charged by the banks and prepay those fees upon the execution of their service contracts with the company 
the company reclassified interest and fees charged by the banks for the year ended december  whereby interest and fees are now as a component of cost of revenue  previously they were netted against revenue  in conformity with the presentation of the year ended december  the result of the reclassifications is to increase revenue and cost of revenue by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

net revenue from financing services for increased to  from  for the company has expanded its aggregate credit lines by approximately million to million as of december   from approximately million as of december  revenue from financing services increased as a result of the increase in credit lines during the period 
our revenue growth from financing services is heavily dependent on overall industry growth and the economic conditions of the market in the prc 
our company established reputable credit with most major commercial banks and although the enormous decrease or the simultaneous expiration of credit lines or other bank facilities may temporarily reduce our capacity to provide financing services and to affect our purchase power  we had not experienced formidable difficulties in the access of credit lines and any other bank facility in the past 
therefore  we do not foresee any difficulty at this time in obtaining credit lines and loan facilities from our banks 
we provide financing services to our customers with our lines of credit with major commercial banks in the prc  including agricultural bank of china  china merchants bank  pudong development bank  china zheshang bank  industrial and commercial bank of china  shengjing bank and china minsheng bank 
we continue to strengthen our relationship with these banks and aim to negotiate with more banks for higher lines of credit at more favorable terms 
based on the company s business relationships with some financial institutions  we are able to obtain financing on an as needed basis and we are in negotiations for a number of new credit lines 
as of march   the company had a credit line of million rmb million 
although all of our lines of credit have maturities of less than one year and may not be renewed on the same terms  if at all  we do not expect that the expiration of our lines of credit with any one of our existing banks will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide financing services 
however  if the automobile market in the prc  and in particular the market for imported automobiles  slows down in the future  our revenue from financing services would be materially and adversely affected by a decreased number of transactions 
web based advertising services the boom from new internet media models such as online video  virtual communities and mobile applications increased online advertising revenues 
moreover  an increasing number of new online media entrants to the auto related media and advertising markets has increased market competition  and thereby  leading to a demand for improved services at low cost

in and  all revenue from web based advertising services is generated by subscription fees and advertisements 
we currently operate in cities throughout china and target to increase the geographical coverage to cities reaching of the auto buying public 
in response to the intensified competition in the online advertising markets in china  we are currently reviewing our plan to expand our coverage to cities throughout china  which was originally scheduled to be completed in due to the improvement works performed in the third quarters of and the price adjustments to our services in the fourth quarter of  the company revenue from web based advertising services for the second half of was lower compared to the same period in as a result  our revenue generated by our websites increased only  from  in to  in following the system improvements and the adjustment to our service packages  we expected that the revenues from web based advertising services will improve 
in and  all of our revenue from our websites was generated by subscription fees and advertisements

our cost of revenue increased  from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the increase in the purchase price of imported automobiles in the year  which is consistent with our net revenue growth rate 
as our cost of revenue consists primarily of the purchase price of imported automobiles  we have limited influence on such costs 
the prices of imported automobiles are determined solely by suppliers and are dependent upon market conditions 
we will continue to work on obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more batch orders

as of the date of this form k  we have not experienced any difficulty in raising funds through bank loans  and we have not experienced any liquidity problems in settling our payables in the normal course of business and repaying our bank loans when they come due 
we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly  we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financings to strengthen the company s financial position  to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us
