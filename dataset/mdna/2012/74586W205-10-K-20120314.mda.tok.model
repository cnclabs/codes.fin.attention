item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks we face described in the risk factors section of this report on pages through except to the extent required by law  we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
we are a global producer of precision engineered electronic components and modules 
based on our estimates of the total annual revenues in our primary markets and our share of those markets relative to our competitors  we believe we are a leading global producer of electronic components and modules in the primary markets we serve 
we operate our business in three segments our network product group which we refer to as network  our power product group which we refer to as power  and our wireless product group which we refer to as wireless 
network produces a variety of passive components that manage and regulate electronic signals for use in various devices used in local area and wide area networks  such as connectors  filters  filtered connectors  transformers  splitters  micro filters  baluns and chokes 
power primarily manufactures products that adjust and ensure proper current and voltage  limit distortion of voltage  sense and report current and voltage and cause mechanical movement or actuation  which includes power transformers  chokes  current and voltage sensors  ignition coils  automotive coils and military and aerospace products 
wireless manufactures products related to the capture or transmission of wireless communication signals  such as antennas  antenna modules and antenna mounting components 
net sales for our three segments for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows in millions network power wireless net sales general 
we define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances 
we sometimes refer to net sales as revenue 
historically  our gross margin has been significantly affected by product mix and capacity utilization 
the markets served by each of our segments are characterized by relatively short product life cycles  which causes significant product turnover each year and  subsequently  frequent variations in the prices of products sold 
due to the constantly changing quantity of parts each segment offers and the frequent changes in our average selling prices  we cannot isolate the impact of changes in unit volume and unit prices on our net sales or gross margin in any given period 
in addition  our operations are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  especially the us dollar as compared to the euro and chinese renminbi  which affect our us dollar reported results of operations 
we believe our focus on technology and other strategic investments  both internal and external  provides us opportunities for future growth in net sales and operating profit in all our segments 
however  unfavorable economic and market conditions  as well as customer preferences  may result in a reduction in demand for our products  thus negatively impacting our financial performance 
also  we may divest portions of our business  close certain locations or complete other cost reduction programs to enable our management to focus on our core businesses and to improve our overall long term financial performance 
technology and strategic investments 
our products evolve along with changes in technology  changes in the availability and price of raw materials and changes in design preferences of the end users of our products 
also  regulatory requirements can occasionally impact the design and functionality of our products 
we address these dynamic conditions  as well as our customers desires  by continually investing in the development of each of our segments products and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies 
we remain committed to technological development through investing in research  development and engineering activities focused on designing next generation products  improving our existing products and improving our manufacturing processes 
if we determine that any of our segments manufacturing processes would benefit from capital investment  we may allocate resources to fund the expansion of property  plant and equipment used in these processes 
for example  we have committed capital to expand our capacity of advanced three dimensional antenna equipment which is used to produce our wireless products 
we have also committed capital to automate certain manual manufacturing processes and to implement an enterprise resource planning erp system to enhance visibility  reduce cost  and enhance customer service 
in the future  similar investments in property  plant and equipment or research  development and engineering may be funded through internally generated cash flows or through other external resources 

table of contents cost reduction programs 
we continue to simplify our operations to optimally match our capacity to the current and anticipated revenues and unit demand of each of our operating segments 
specific actions to simplify our operations will dictate the future expenses associated with our cost reduction programs 
actions taken over the past several years  such as divestitures  plant closures  plant relocations  asset impairments and reduction in personnel  have resulted in the elimination of a variety of future costs 
the majority of these costs  not related to the impairment of long lived assets  represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees  including both those related to manufacturing and those that provided selling  general and administrative services 
also  we have experienced depreciation savings from disposed equipment and reductions in rental expense from the termination of lease agreements 
historically  we have also reduced labor and overhead costs as a result of relocating factories to lower cost locations  specifically china 
the savings created by these cost reduction programs impact cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  but the timing of such savings may not be apparent due to other performance factors such as unanticipated changes in demand  changes in unit selling prices  operational challenges and changes in operating strategies 
during the year ended december   we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related costs of million  million of fixed asset write downs that are no longer in use  and a million write down of a manufacturing facility to its fair value 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
also  we recorded an impairment of million for an indefinite lived tradename during refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for further details 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
divestitures 
we have completed divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position 
for example  we divested the european and asian businesses of our former electrical contact products segment in september for net proceeds of approximately million 
also  we completed the sale of electrical s north american business for an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements during january we have had no continuing material involvement with any of our divested operations after each respective sale 
management focus 
our executives focus on a number of metrics to evaluate our consolidated financial condition and operating performance 
for example  we use consolidated revenue growth  gross margin  operating margin and return on research  development and engineering as performance measures 
operating leverage  or incremental operating profit as a percentage of incremental sales  is also reviewed  which reflects the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses 
in evaluating consolidated working capital  liquidity and cash flow  our executives also use performance measures such as days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding  inventory turnover  debt to ebitda leverage  cash conversion efficiency and free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital spending 
additionally  as the continued success of our business is largely dependent on meeting and exceeding our customers expectations  non financial performance measures relating to product development  product quality and on time delivery assists in monitoring customer satisfaction on an on going basis 
international operations 
at december   we had manufacturing operations in the us  south korea  and china 
however  nearly all of our products are manufactured in china and sold to customers in china and other foreign countries 
our net sales are denominated primarily in us dollars  euros and chinese renminbi 
changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and our period over period comparisons 
this is particularly true of movements in the us dollar s exchange rate with the chinese renminbi and the euro  and each of these and other foreign currencies relative to each other 
sales and net earnings denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may result in higher or lower net sales and net earnings upon translation for our us dollar denominated consolidated financial statements 
for example  sales in certain divisions of power and wireless are denominated primarily in renminbi and euro 
also  net earnings may be affected by the mix of sales and expenses by currency within each of our segments 
foreign currency gains or losses may be incurred when non functional currency denominated transactions are remeasured to an operation s functional currency for financial reporting purposes 
an increase in the percentage of our transactions denominated in non us currencies may result in increased foreign exchange exposure on our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investments in non us dollar functional subsidiaries may translate to more or less us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
in order to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations  we may purchase foreign exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
these contracts provide a predetermined exchange rate or range of rates at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuation from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee 
in determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options  we consider the amount of sales  purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies  the currency to be hedged and the costs associated with the contracts 
at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was an asset of million as determined through use of level inputs 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions  such as those in europe and the united states  and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  such as hong kong and china 
this mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another 
additionally  our effective income tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significant transactions and the deductibility or non deductibility of severance and impairment costs and other similar costs as well as by changes in our net deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
changes in operations  tax legislation  estimates  judgments and forecasts may also affect our tax rate from period to period 

table of contents we have generally not provided for us and foreign withholding taxes on our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
we expect to reinvest this cash and earnings outside of the united states  because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for future growth will be abroad 
in addition  we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside the united states 
thus  with the exception of earnings in the amount of million as of december   these undistributed earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the us indefinitely 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions  such as those in europe and the united states  and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  such as hong kong and china 
this mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another 
additionally  our effective income tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significant transactions and the deductibility or non deductibility of severance and impairment costs and other similar costs as well as by changes in our net deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
changes in operations  tax legislation  estimates  judgments and forecasts may also affect our tax rate from period to period 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements on pages through describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are subject to review by the audit committee of our board of directors 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for inventory  divestitures  acquisitions  identifiable intangibles  income taxes  defined benefit plans  contingency accruals and severance and asset impairments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements inventory valuation 
we carry our inventories at lower of cost or market 
inventory provisions are created to write down excess and obsolete inventory to market value 
we utilize historical trends and customer forecasts to estimate the expected usage of our inventory that is on hand 
the establishment of inventory provisions requires judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
however  we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  inventory purchases are based upon estimates of future demand that are based upon customer forecasts and the trend of product sales over recent historical periods 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements  than we may be required to write down our inventory which would cause a negative impact to gross margin 
however  if we were subsequently able to sell or use a significant portion of inventory that was previously written down  our gross margin could be positively affected 
divestiture accounting 
we engage in divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our debt and to strengthen our financial position 
when the operations and cash flows of the divestiture have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and  also  when we do not expect to have any significant continuing involvement with such operations  we may report the business that has either been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale  as a discontinued operation 
if we plan to dispose of the business by sale  we are required to report the divested business at the lower of its carrying amount or at its fair value less costs to sell in the period it is classified as held for sale 
these assessments require judgments and estimates which include determining when it is appropriate to classify the business as held for sale  if the business meets the specifications of a discontinued operation  determining the fair value of the business and determining the level and type of involvement  if any  we will have with the disposed business in the future 
furthermore  when removing the divested business from our consolidated balance sheets  and  if necessary  restating results in prior periods  we are required to make assumptions  judgments and estimates regarding  among other things  the assets  liabilities and activities of the business and their relation to our continuing businesses 
intangible assets  net 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter  and  on an interim basis if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
as of december  and december   the carrying amount of goodwill was zero 
prior to  we had goodwill in our consolidated financial statements which was subject to an annual impairment review 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit  with its carrying value 
we estimate our reporting units fair value using both an income approach and a comparable companies market approach 
the income approach is based on estimating future cash flows using various growth assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor 
the comparable companies market approach considers the trading multiples of peer companies to compute our estimated fair value 
as a result of an unexpected decline in the actual and forecasted sales and operating profit of our wireless reporting unit  we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of our wireless reporting unit did not pass the first step of the impairment test 
accordingly  we undertook the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis and determined that the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill was as a result  management recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of in addition to the impairment  we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of as a result of the decline in our stock price and decrease in our forecasted operating profit  which our wireless reporting unit failed 
the second step of the impairment test resulted in a million goodwill impairment at our wireless reporting unit 
refer to note  intangible assets  net and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

table of contents we measure the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  which consists of tradenames  using the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the tradenames have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related tradenames  the appropriate royalty rate  and the weighted average cost of capital 
we performed our assessment in the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our tradenames exceeded the carrying value and therefore was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we tested the carrying value of our tradenames  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
other finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over to years 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows  undiscounted and without interest  is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
during the second quarter of  we decided to further simplify our operations by considering alternatives to withdraw from the audio market 
as a result  we performed a recoverability test on the finite lived intangible assets related to our audio products  which resulted in impairment charges of million to our technology intangibles 
in addition  as a result of a significant decline in wireless actual and forecasted sales and operating profit during the first quarter of  we performed a recoverability test on a finite lived customer relationship intangible asset which resulted in an million impairment charge 
refer to note  intangibles assets  net and goodwill  of the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and  also  for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and  also  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates  relative to our provision for income taxes  take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law  or our interpretation of tax laws  and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on consideration of all available evidence 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income  carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset 
as of december   we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize any of our deferred tax assets resulting from recent losses as well as other factors 
consequently  we recorded an additional valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
the increased valuation allowance was recorded as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence  including our history of losses in recent years and the difficulty of forecasting future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only after determining that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we regularly reassess the positions taken and record any changes  as appropriate 
defined benefit plans 
on december   our management froze the plan benefits of our domestic defined benefit retirement plan 
also  during we settled the obligations of our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan  which was contingent on the sale of electrical 
the costs and obligations of our defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant specific information such as compensation  age  and years of service  as well as certain assumptions  including estimates of discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest crediting rates  and mortality rates 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments 
for our pension obligations in the united states  a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with varying maturities is used to discount expected benefit payments to their present value 
this generates our discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans 
for our foreign plans  we use the market rates for high quality corporate bonds to derive our discount rate assumption 
the expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected from our invested pension assets 
we have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios 
changes in these assumptions could result in different expense and liability amounts  as well as a change in future contributions to the plans 
however  we do not believe that a range of reasonable changes to these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statement 
refer to note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the primary assumptions used in determining the cost and obligations of our defined benefit plans 

table of contents contingency accruals 
during the normal course of business  a variety of issues arise which may result in litigation  environmental compliance and other contingent obligations 
in developing our contingency accruals  we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure 
we record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount of exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted  which includes an assessment of legal interpretations  judicial proceedings  recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims 
in future periods  we could be required to record additional expenses  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the charges that were initially recorded  if our estimates were too high 
additionally  the litigation costs we incur in connection with a contingency are expensed as incurred  since the nature of these costs is generally unpredictable and cannot be reasonably estimated prior to being incurred 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
we record severance  asset impairments and other charges  such as contract terminations costs  in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity  changing technology and other factors 
these costs  which we refer to as restructuring costs  are expensed when we determine that we have incurred those costs and  also  the requirements for accrual have been met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time the action is initiated 
our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this occurs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the initial charges  if our initial estimates were too high 
additionally  the cash flow impact of an activity may not be recognized in the same period the expense has been incurred 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which requires presentation of the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
asu is effective beginning after the first day of our fiscal and must be applied retrospectively 
we expect to present comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements 
other than the change in presentation  we have determined these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective beginning after the first day of our fiscal and must be applied prospectively 
given our immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities that require level inputs we do not expect the impact of the adoption of asu to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb amended its authoritative guidance related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
these amendments clarify existing guidance for comparative financial statements that include a business combination 
specifically  revenue and earnings of the combined business are required to be disclosed as though the combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
also  the amendment expands supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of nonrecurring pro forma adjustments  to revenue and earnings  which are directly attributable to the business combination 
this guidance is prospective for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the first day of our fiscal if we enter into any business combinations subsequent to  we will evaluate the effect that this guidance may have on the consolidated financial statements in accounting for such transactions 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both us dollars and percentages dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs costs related to unsolicited takeover attempt operating loss interest expense  net other expense  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
our consolidated net sales decreased by primarily as a result of lower demand in network due to lower industry demand and the utilization of remaining inventory purchased by certain customers during we also experienced a decline in sales of our wireless products in the mobile handset market 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in sales to new antenna customers by wireless 
the foreign currency effect on our us dollar reported sales were neutral when comparing the results for the year ended december  and december  net sales for our three segments for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows in millions network power wireless net sales gross profit 
our consolidated gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in our gross profit during the year ended december  was primarily the result of lower demand  higher wage rates  higher raw material costs  and lower pricing for certain network and power products 
partially offsetting these decreases was the effect of continued migration of our manufacturing to lower cost existing facilities located in central china in selling  general and administrative expenses 
total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million primarily due to lower costs as a result of expense reductions announced earlier in  lower business volumes  and the effects of prudent expense management 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  and december   respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales our rd e spending as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  is consistent with the year ended december  we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next generation products 
as a result  design and development activities with our oem customers continue at an aggressive pace that is consistent with market activity 
also  included in rd e expense for the year ended december  and december  was approximately million and million of legal expenses  respectively  which we incurred in connection with the patent lawsuit filed by halo electronics 
refer to further discussion in note  commitments and contingencies 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million  lease termination costs of million  million of fixed asset write downs that are no longer in use  and a million write down of a manufacturing facility to its fair value 
of the million restructuring charge incurred during the year ended december   approximately million related to the transition and reorganization of our corporate headquarters in north america  which was initiated in the first quarter of and was completed before the end of refer to note  severance  impairment and other associated costs  to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
also  we recorded an impairment of million for an indefinite lived tradename during refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  for further details 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
costs related to unsolicited takeover attempt 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to bel fuse s unsolicited takeover attempt 
the majority of these costs represent fees of our financial and legal advisors 
we do no not expect to incur significant additional fees or similar costs related to this matter 
interest 
net interest expense increased by million primarily due to an increase in our debt fee amortization of million due to fees incurred in connection with the amendment to our senior revolving credit facility in august and a write down of previously capitalized debt fees 
in addition  interest expense on our senior revolving credit facility had been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on a pro rata basis based upon the debt repaid from the disposition of our discontinued operations as compared to our total debt outstanding during the year ended december  resulting in lower interest expense from continuing operations 
other 
net other expense for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to net foreign exchange activity related to changes in the varying currencies of our intercompany lending program of million  partially offset from the reversal of a contingency accrual that was originally recorded in purchase accounting for a legacy acquisition 
during the year ended december   we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately million during the comparable period of the decreased exposure in foreign currency changes was the result of continued simplification efforts and the reduction of legal entities 
also  included in net other expense for the year ended december  was a loss recorded to write down an available for sale property to the net proceeds received on its sale 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a tax expense of compared to an expense of for the year ended december  the increase in our expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of our valuation allowance by approximately million in  of which million resulted in an increase in income tax expense 
we maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on consideration of all available evidence 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income  carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset 
as of december   we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize any of our deferred tax assets resulting from recent losses as well as other factors 
consequently  we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
the increased valuation allowance was recorded as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence  including our history of losses in recent years and the difficulty of forecasting future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 
the effective tax rate was also impacted by the recording of tax reserve related to audit in a foreign jurisdiction and the release of tax reserve related to actions to streamline our legal entity structure  specifically the dissolution of a non us legal entity which we no longer operate and lapses in statutes of limitation 

table of contents discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was less than million during the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million during the comparable period of during the year ended december   our results from discontinued operations included a gain recorded upon the completion of the sale of our electrical business and a gain recorded on the medtech divestiture as a result of settling an unresolved matter that existed at the date of sale 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of income to reflect updated estimates of the net proceeds we expect to receive upon the disposition of the remaining operations of electrical  offset by million of costs incurred in connection with the electrical sale to reimburse the buyer for certain contingent costs that we were obligated to pay under the sale agreement 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both us dollars and percentages dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs operating loss interest expense  net other expense income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
our consolidated net sales increased by primarily as a result of the improved net sales of our network and power segments particularly in our local area network  power management and automotive products 
partially offsetting this improvement was a decrease in the demand for the products of our wireless segment in both the mobile handset and audio markets 
the decreased demand in the mobile handset market was primarily caused by the loss of certain business with a major oem customer due to a sourcing change  which began in the second half of additionally  we experienced lower us dollar reported sales in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to adverse changes in the foreign exchange rates of our non us dollar sales 
gross profit 
our consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in our gross profit margin during the year ended december  was primarily the result of lower margins incurred by our wireless segment caused by excess capacity due to the loss of certain business with a major oem customer  accelerated depreciation realized on certain assets of wireless and power that became idle during and higher labor costs resulting from increased minimum wage rates in our manufacturing facilities in china 
also  the results for the year ended december  were positively affected by business interruption insurance proceeds related to an earthquake that occurred in mianyang  china during partially offsetting these decreases to our gross profit were cost reduction and price increasing initiatives  the positive effects of manufacturing cost absorption from increased sales volume at network and power  a mix of sales in certain higher margin products and improved labor costs caused by a transition of operations to regions in china with lower wage rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional selling and marketing expenses caused by higher sales and  also  additional legal and incentive compensation costs 
partially offsetting these increases was lower intangible amortization caused by the impairment charge recorded on certain finite intangible assets during the first six months of and a curtailment gain that resulted from freezing our domestic defined benefit retirement plan at the end of for the year ended december   we were able to leverage our increased revenue on consistent selling  general and administrative spending which caused our selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  to decline from the comparable period of 
table of contents research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  and december   respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales rd e increased in the year ended december  primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million of legal expenses we incurred in connection with the patent lawsuit filed by halo electronics 
without the effects of the additional legal expenses  our rd e  as a percentage of sales  was approximately 
our spending on rd e activities tends to develop at a rate which is less dramatic than our sales changes 
due to the increased level of sales we experienced in the year ended december   our rd e as a percentage of sales was lower than historical levels 
we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next generation products 
as a result  design and development activities with our oem customers continue at an aggressive pace consistent with our markets activity 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
also  we recorded an impairment of million to one of our indefinite lived tradenames 
refer to note  intangible assets  net and goodwill  to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment which were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill was impaired 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed 
interest 
net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior notes we issued during the fourth quarter of lower interest was incurred on borrowings from our credit facility during the year ended december   because our debt outstanding under the facility decreased 
in both and  interest on our outstanding loans and amortization of capitalized loan fees related to our credit agreement were allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on a pro rata basis  based upon the debt repaid from the disposition of each of our discontinued operations as compared to our total debt outstanding 
other 
other expense or income is primarily attributable to our net foreign exchange activity on intercompany loans and advances among varying currencies 
during the year ended december   we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately million as compared to foreign exchange gains of approximately million during the comparable period of the increase in foreign exchange losses was due to the overall strengthening of the us dollar to euro during the year ended december  as compared to a weakening of the us dollar to euro in the same period of also  included in net other expense for the year ended december  was a loss recorded to write down an available for sale property to the net proceeds received on its sale 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a tax expense of compared to a tax expense of for the year ended december  the change in our effective tax rate is primarily due to lower goodwill impairment charges in compared to  the expiration of certain non us tax holidays and reduced losses and non deductible expenses incurred in certain jurisdictions where we expect limited tax benefits 
discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million in the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a charge to reduce the net assets of electrical to the net proceeds we received upon the completion of its sale 
the loss from discontinued operations incurred during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to estimated losses to write down the net assets of electrical to the net proceeds we anticipated receiving from the disposition and a charge to reduce the net assets of medtech and mems to the actual net proceeds we received upon the completion of each sale 
also  we recorded estimates for the settlement of certain accelerated retirement plan benefits at both electrical and medtech during the year ended december  a summary of our net income loss from each of our discontinued operations for the years ended december  and december  is as follows in thousands electrical medtech mems total 
table of contents business outlook our levels of net sales  customer portfolio and product mix have a significant impact on our gross margin  results of operations and cash flow 
specifically  we experienced consolidated sales and operating performance during which were lower than levels 
this was primarily a result of decreased sales volume across wireless and network 
in addition  higher costs resulted from wage rates and material costs 
to address these issues  we continue to focus on transitioning our manufacturing from locations with higher wage rates  such as those in southern china  to lower cost areas in the central regions of china 
also  we implemented overall price increases where possible to combat rising material costs and increasing minimum wage rates 
we continue to pursue design wins with new wireless oem s and further our existing relationships with other wireless customers in an effort to address the declining segment revenues caused by the loss of the majority of our sales from a former major handset oem customer due to the customer s decision to make a sourcing change 
also  our efforts toward streamlining our overall general and administrative expenses to achieve an optimal level of spending that is appropriate for the size and structure of our company have been initially evidenced by the lower expenses incurred during the year ended december  however  we remain focused on reducing our general and administrative expenses  and expect to experience further improvements during finally  we plan to enhance our information technology capabilities by implementing a new erp system 
we believe that the erp will enable us to realize working capital efficiencies  streamline our operations and enable us to further reduce our overall cost structure 
we continue to commit resources to the development of new technologies and products that have higher forecasted margins  to the automation of certain manufacturing processes and to the expansion of our international sales  marketing and engineering teams in regions closest to our customers 
also  we plan on continuing to adjust our marketing and engineering efforts in wireless in order to increase revenue streams from a more diverse base of customers 
our focus will be on wireless products with higher forecasted margins  while shifting from those markets where we expect limited returns 
for example  we decided to eliminate the audio components business to streamline our operations and focus on those wireless products that are forecasted with better returns 
liquidity and capital resources we present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method 
our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable  inventory and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows 
also  changes in working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business s cash flow than items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods  which would appear using the direct method 
cash flows from discontinued operations have been separated from continuing operations and are disclosed in aggregate by each cash flow activity 
significant uses of cash in included the funding of cost reduction actions and capital expenditures for implementation of a new erp system and growth in the wireless segment 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the comparable period of  a decrease of million 
the decline was primarily attributable to a net decrease in cash provided by working capital changes in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and higher net operating losses  excluding goodwill and intangible asset impairments  incurred in as compared to the same period of revenue declined by approximately from to  due primarily to softness in the markets for our network products 
as a result of lower market demand  our cost reduction actions and other items  we experienced a net operating cash outflow during the year ended december  capital expenditures were million during the year ended december  and million in the increase of million was due to a focus in to expand new investment to programs which we believe are essential to our future growth  primarily related to our wireless and network segments and to the implementation of our erp system 
we make capital expenditures to invest in new products  expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency 
we made million of dividend payments during the year ended december  we do not anticipate that we will make dividend payments in periods subsequent to the year ended december  we believe that use of these funds can generate a higher return if utilized to continue the execution of our strategic initiatives  in particular in the near term to improve our wireless business  to continue our restructuring program and to implement a new erp system 
we have million in convertible senior notes  which will mature on december  the notes bear a coupon rate of per annum that is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million of interest related to the coupon rate on the convertible senior notes 
we expect to pay approximately million of interest on those notes in on december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
our credit facility was amended on march  as explained below 
as amended  it provides for borrowings not to exceed million in us dollars  euros and yen  with a multicurrency facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the us dollar equivalent of million 
the maturity date of the facility is february  
table of contents we previously amended our credit facility on august  the amendment in august included a reduction to the borrowings permitted under the credit facility from million to million  which was further reduced to million following a debt repayment in september  and an increase in the interest rates on both the unborrowed portion of the commitment and on the outstanding borrowings 
we also agreed to limit our borrowings to an amount not to exceed total eligible accounts receivable and cash  to maintain available cash of million  to limit our capital expenditures to specific levels in and  and to suspend payment of dividends following a payment in the quarter ended december  as of december   we were required to maintain certain financial covenants measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the primary financial covenants were i total debt excluding our convertible senior notes as compared to our rolling four quarter ebitda  ii fixed charges as compared to our rolling four quarter ebitda  and iii a minimum rolling six month ebitda 
in the fourth quarter of  we did not meet certain of these financial covenants 
on march   we further amended the credit agreement and received a waiver for these covenants for the fourth quarter of the march  amendment eliminated the requirement that we comply with these financial covenants for the remainder of the facility term  reduced our borrowing limit from million to million  increased the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings to  reduced our permitted capital expenditures and reduced the available cash we are required to maintain to million 
in addition  in connection with the amendment  we issued in a private placement warrants to the lender group to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants vest and become exercisable as follows on june   warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock will vest unless we have repaid the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility by such date  on september   warrants to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock will vest unless we have repaid the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility by such date  and on december   warrants to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock will vest unless we have repaid the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility by such date 
thus  if we repay the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility by any such dates  any unvested warrants will revert to us and will effectively be cancelled 
if the outstanding borrowings are not repaid as of june   but repayment occurs as of september  or as of december  then million or million of the warrants will revert to us and be cancelled  respectively 
if the outstanding borrowings are not repaid by december   none of the warrants will revert to us 
the warrants are exercisable from the vesting date through march  we paid total fees and expenses of approximately million in connection with the august amendment  of which million have been capitalized as debt issuance costs and amortized on a straight line basis through the maturity date of the debt 
we will incur fees and expenses related to the march amendment  including million of fees upon execution of the amendment  legal fees and other related expenses 
under the amendment  additional fees calculated as of outstanding borrowings are due on specific dates in if amounts under the facility remain outstanding at those dates 
as of march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and million in convertible senior notes 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness  we have accelerated our strategic plan to significantly delever our balance sheet 
consistent with our strategy to streamline our business operations and focus on our core competencies in each of our network  power  and wireless segments  we have identified a number of non strategic assets that remain within our three segments 
these assets represent product lines and facilities  but the potential disposal of any or all of these assets will enable us to increase our focus on the future growth or business prospects of the company 
to that end  we have engaged financial advisors to direct the possible sale of certain non strategic assets 
we entered into a definitive agreement to complete the first of these sales on february  this transaction includes the sale of two of our manufacturing plants and related equipment in china and our encapsulated transformer product line 
we are also currently engaged in the process of selling two additional non strategic assets 
we expect these transactions to be completed by the end of the second quarter of we also expect to increasingly benefit from a series of actions taken in to improve our liquidity and cash available from operations 
these actions included restructuring actions  headcount reductions  plant consolidations and reductions in general and administrative expenses 
we intend to continue prudent management of our expenses and cash balances in we are a party to various legal proceedings  claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business  and may continue to incur significant costs in defending or settling legal matters 
the total amount and timing of the expected future payments related to these matters cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the duration of the legal proceedings and the ultimate scope of other claims 
however  an unfavorable outcome in a single matter or in multiple legal matters during the same reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit filed in march by halo electronics  inc in the united states district court  district of nevada 
the case is captioned halo electronics  inc v 
pulse electronics  inc and pulse electronics corp  case no 
cv pmp pal 
the plaintiff claims that we infringe certain us patents related to an electronic surface mount package  and is seeking injunctive relief and damages 
discovery has ended  and on september   the court ruled on numerous pending motions for summary judgment 
the court denied the plaintiff s motion for summary judgment of infringement by our products with the exception of one claim relating to one representative product 
the court partially granted one of our summary judgment motions  in effect  excluding any liability for direct infringement for products sold outside of north america on all of plaintiff s claims 
a trial date has been scheduled for july  and the court has ordered a pre trial settlement conference for june  the plaintiff has previously produced expert reports asserting infringement and liability in the amount of million  plus requests for trebling and attorneys fees 
however  these reports do not take into account the court s september ruling  which excluded direct foreign sales and therefore may reduce our potential exposure to significantly less than half of the amount claimed by the plaintiff 
in addition  we are aware that similar cases have been brought by halo electronics against certain of our competitors  and that at least one of our competitors commenced a similar independent patent litigation against halo electronics 
although we are not familiar with the specific details of these cases or the plaintiff s claims  we believe that one of these cases has recently been settled on terms that  among other things  provide for significantly less up front cash to halo electronics than the amount of damages that it has claimed in our case 

table of contents in light of the court s summary judgment order and its ruling that we are not liable with respect to direct infringement for products sold outside north america we recorded a charge of approximately million as selling  general and administrative expense in the year ended december  we intend to continue presenting a vigorous defense against the remaining claims in the case  to maintain our counterclaim that pulse owes no liability whatsoever to halo due to the invalidity of the halo patents  to contest the amount of damages asserted by halo and its expert  and to consider our rights of appeal with respect to any adverse rulings 
however  management is currently unable to determine whether any additional loss will occur or to estimate the range of such loss 
therefore  no additional liability has been accrued 
during the years ended december  and december   we incurred approximately million and million of legal expenses  respectively  related to this matter 
in march  we received an unsolicited proposal from bel fuse to acquire all of our outstanding shares 
our board of directors unanimously determined that bel fuse s proposal significantly undervalued our business and was not in the best interests of our company  our shareholders and other constituents 
bel fuse had also nominated two directors for election to our board 
at our annual meeting of shareholders on may   the bel fuse nominees were not elected to our board 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to bel fuse s unsolicited takeover attempt 
the majority of these costs represent fees of our financial and legal advisors 
we do no not expect to incur significant additional fees or similar costs related to this matter 
our domestic defined benefit retirement plan is currently under audit by the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc 
initial communications from the pbgc have indicated that the sale of electrical s north america operations may have resulted in a partial plan termination  which may require us to accelerate the funding of up to approximately million to this defined plan 
a partial plan termination would only result in a cash payment to fund our plan and will not directly result in any additional expenses to the company 
in february  legislation was introduced that would likely limit the applicability of the erisa section e rule to complete shutdowns 
we are continuing discussions with the pbgc on this matter 
we do not anticipate making any cash payments to our domestic defined benefit retirement plan in during the year ended december   we paid million related to an uncertain tax position previously taken by of one of our foreign subsidiaries income tax filings 
settlement of this matter may result in additional payments of as much as million 
this amount has been fully accrued as of december  on february   we announced that our corporate headquarters located in trevose  pennsylvania would be consolidated into our us operational headquarters in san diego  california 
this consolidation was completed during in connection with our actions to simplify and streamline our organizational structure 
we incurred approximately million of total severance and other associated costs in related to the consolidation of our headquarters  which will generate an estimated annual cost savings of approximately million 
cash payments resulting from the severance charges recorded in the year ended december  will be completed within as of december   future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows in thousands amounts expected to be paid by period total less than year to years to years thereafter long term debt convertible senior notes estimated interest payments operating leases excludes other obligations under employment contracts that are generally only payable upon a change of control 
estimated interest payments reflect the current borrowing rates for our outstanding convertible senior notes and long term debt under the senior revolving credit facility  including the changes to interest as a result of the amendment to the credit facility in march in the schedule of estimated future payments related to our contractual obligations  we excluded unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and the period of payment 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  million of cash held by a majority owned subsidiary was used to make payments on outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   this majority owned subsidiary holds approximately million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents 
permanent access to funds from this subsidiary could be in the form of a dividend to its shareholders  which could result in income withholding taxes and distributions to minority shareholders 
as of december  there are no plans to repatriate funds held at this majority owned subsidiary 
earlier in  this majority owned subsidiary announced a plan to purchase its own common stock that is publically traded on a foreign exchange 
as of the date these financial statements were issued  the majority owned subsidiary purchased approximately million of its own common stock with its cash on hand 
we do not anticipate any additional spending for common stock buyback plans in the foreseeable future 

table of contents with the exception of the cash and cash equivalents located at the majority owned subsidiary  we have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and no restrictions are foreseen 
however  foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time 
we expect to reinvest this cash and earnings outside of the united states  because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for future growth will be abroad 
in addition  we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside the united states 
thus  with the exception of earnings in the amount of million  we have not provided for us federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings that have been indefinitely invested abroad 
if these earnings were brought back to the united states  significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the united states as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the us statutory rate 
our retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of december   with the exception of approximately million of subsidiary retained earnings primarily in china  that are restricted in accordance with section of the prc foreign investment enterprises law 
the million includes approximately million of retained earnings of a majority owned subsidiary 
the amount restricted in accordance with the prc foreign investment enterprise law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in china 
the restriction applies to of our net earnings in china  limited to of the total capital invested 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents and long term debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility  are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the us and abroad 
we may invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
we generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical 
our board of directors has adopted policies relating to these risks and continually monitors compliance with these policies 
our revolving credit facility has variable interest rates 
accordingly  interest expense may increase if we borrow and or if the rates associated with our borrowings increase 
in march  in connection with amendment to our credit facility  the credit margin spread on our outstanding borrowings under the credit facility increased to 
in addition  we may pursue additional or alternative financing 
we may also use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps or other instruments in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates 
however  we have not used any of these instruments to date 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities in our consolidated financial statements which would materially affect our current or future financial condition or results from operations 
the table below presents principal amounts in us dollars and the related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations

table of contents foreign currency risk as of december   we had a substantial amount of assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including those of non hyperinflationary emerging market countries in asia as well as european countries 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges  to manage foreign currency risks 
gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items 
therefore  all of our forward exchange contracts are marked to market  and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee 
we believe there are two primary risks of holding these instruments 
the first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which would create a better economic outcome than if the hedging instrument was not in place 
the second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations 
we reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks 
in determining the use of forward exchange contracts  we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies  the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts 
during the year ended december   we utilized forward contracts to sell forward euro to receive chinese renminbi 
these contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations at our operations in china 
at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was an asset of million as determined through use of level inputs as defined in asc topic at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level inputs
