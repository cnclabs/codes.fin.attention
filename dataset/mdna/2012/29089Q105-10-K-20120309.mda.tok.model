some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview product portfolio we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on protecting and enhancing life by developing and manufacturing vaccines and therapeutics that are supplied to healthcare providers and purchasers for use in preventing and treating disease 
for financial reporting purposes  we operate in two business segments  biodefense and biosciences 
our biodefense segment is directed to government sponsored development and supply of countermeasures against potential agents of bioterror or biowarfare and targets the infectious disease anthrax 
our programs in this division include a pipeline of investigational product candidates and one marketed product  biothrax anthrax vaccine adsorbed  the only vaccine approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the prevention of anthrax disease 
operations in this segment include biologics manufacturing  regulatory and quality affairs in support of biothrax and a product development infrastructure in support of our investigational product candidates 
our biosciences segment is directed to commercial opportunities and targets oncology  including the b cell malignancies chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  and non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  the t cell malignancies cutaneous t cell lymphoma  or ctcl  and peripheral t cell lymphoma  or ptcl  autoimmune and inflammatory disorders  or aiid  including rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza 
our programs in this segment include clinical and preclinical stage investigational product candidates and development programs for our platform technologies 
operations in this segment include product development in support of our investigational product candidates  and manufacturing and related infrastructure initiatives in support of our technology platforms 
our biodefense segment has generated net income for each of the last five fiscal years 
over this timeframe  our biosciences segment has generated revenue through development contracts and collaborative funding  but none of our biosciences product candidates have received marketing approval and  therefore  our biosciences segment has not generated any product sales revenues 
as a result  our biosciences segment has incurred a net loss for each of the last five fiscal years 
product sales we have derived substantially all of our product sales revenues from biothrax sales to the us government 
we are currently a party to a contract with the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc  an operating division of the us department of health and human services  or hhs  to supply million doses of biothrax for placement into the strategic national stockpile  or sns  over a five year period 
we expect for the foreseeable future to continue to derive substantially all of our product sales revenues from our sales of biothrax to the us government 
our total revenues from biothrax sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are focused on increasing sales of biothrax to us government customers  expanding the market for biothrax to other customers domestically and internationally and pursuing label expansions and improvements for biothrax 
contracts and grants we seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements 
we may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding 
we have received funding from the us government for the following development programs biothrax as a post exposure prophylaxis  or pep  nuthrax  large scale manufacturing for biothrax  previthrax  anthrivig  thravixa  double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine  and recombinant botulinum vaccine 
additionally  our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is indirectly supported by grant funding provided to the university of oxford by the wellcome trust  aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation and the european and developing countries clinical trial partnerships 
our sbi product candidate is substantially funded by pfizer inc  or pfizer  which is developing and commercializing sbi our tru product candidate has been funded via our collaboration with abbott laboratories  or abbott  in which we and abbott shared all funding responsibilities equally 
in december  abbott notified us that they are terminating the collaboration agreement effective march  we continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and commercial collaborative relationships 
we also encourage both governmental and non governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations to provide development funding or to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates 
manufacturing infrastructure we conduct our primary vaccine manufacturing operations at a multi building campus on approximately acres in lansing  michigan 
to augment our existing manufacturing capabilities  we have constructed building  a  square foot large scale manufacturing facility on our lansing campus 
in july  we entered into an agreement with the biomedical advanced research and development authority  or barda  to finalize development of and obtain regulatory approval for large scale manufacturing of biothrax in building this agreement provides for funding from barda of up to approximately million over a five year contract term  including a two year base period of performance valued at approximately million 
in november  we purchased a building in baltimore  maryland for product development and manufacturing purposes  and are in the process of completing renovation  improvement and equipment acquisitions at this facility 
we have entered into two loan agreements with pnc bank totaling up to million to fund these renovations  improvements and equipment acquisitions 
our specific plans for this facility will be contingent on the progress of our existing development programs and the outcome of our efforts to acquire new product candidates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  income taxes  stock based compensation  investments  in process research and development  goodwill and contingent value rights 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales if four basic criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have generated biothrax sales revenues under us government contracts with hhs and the cdc 
under our current contract with the cdc  we invoice the cdc and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government at the delivery site  at which time title to the product passes to the cdc 
from time to time  we are awarded reimbursement contracts for services and development grant contracts with government entities and philanthropic organizations 
under these contracts  we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities  and we may also be entitled to additional fees 
revenue on our reimbursable contracts is recognized as costs are incurred  generally based on the allowable costs incurred during the period  plus any recognizable earned fee 
the amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter  depending on the scope and nature of the work performed 
we record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense 
we also generate revenues from our collaborations in which certain internal and external research and development costs and patent costs are reimbursed in connection with our collaboration agreements 
reimbursed costs under our agreement with pfizer are recognized as revenue in the period in which the costs are incurred 
under the collaboration agreement with abbott  which abbott terminated effective march   abbott shares development and clinical costs with us equally 
each quarter the parties are required to report the total costs incurred for development 
the total spending by each party is then compared to the spending by the other party 
in the event that our spending for a given quarter exceeds the spending of abbott  we record a net receivable in our financial statements for the difference between our spending and of the total spending for the period  and recognize revenue equal to this amount 
if abbott s spending for the quarterly period exceeds our spending  we record a net payable in our financial statements equal to the difference between our spending and of the total spending  and record additional research and development expenses in this amount 
as a result  our revenues and research and development expenses for periods that end prior to or include the termination date of the collaboration agreement may fluctuate depending on which party in the collaboration incurred the majority of the development costs in any particular quarterly period 
contracts and grants revenues are subject to the estimation processes to the extent that the reimbursable costs underlying these revenues are incurred but not billed and agreed to on a timely basis  and are subject to change in future periods when actual costs are known 
to date we have not made material adjustments to these estimates 
we recognize revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  when the milestones are achieved 
if not deemed substantive  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining expected term of continued involvement in the research and development process 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
average cost consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses and includes the services and products of third party suppliers 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected customer demand 
we also write off costs related to expired inventory 
we capitalize the costs associated with the manufacture of biothrax as inventory from the initiation of the manufacturing process through the completion of manufacturing  labeling and packaging 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of income tax accounting  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in process research and development expenses  the anticipated future benefit of the net operating losses and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states  primarily maryland  and in some foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom 
in connection with our october acquisition of trubion pharmaceuticals  inc  or trubion  we acquired significant federal net operating losses and research and development tax credits along with other tax attributes 
the amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards  including those acquired in our acquisition of trubion  to offset future taxable income 
the applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards as a result of ownership changes 
in particular  we believe that these rules will significantly limit our ability to use net operating losses generated by microscience limited  or microscience  and antex biologics  inc  or antex  prior to our acquisition of microscience in june and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of antex in may we do not expect that these limitation rules will significantly limit the net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards acquired in the trubion acquisition 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement  which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
if we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets  we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement  which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
uncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
contingent value rights in accordance with the terms of our acquisition of trubion in october  we have committed to make potential future contingent value right  or cvr  payments to former shareholders and stock option holders of trubion 
the obligation to make cvr payments expires on october  cvr payments generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
the obligation for these contingencies has been recorded in our financial statements at fair value 
the fair value model used for the cvr obligations is based on a discounted cash flow model that has been risk adjusted based on the probability of achievement of the milestones 
we re evaluate the fair value of the cvr obligations on a quarterly basis 
any future increase in the fair value of the cvr obligations  based on an increased likelihood that the underlying milestones will be achieved and the associated payment or payments will therefore become due and payable  will result in a charge to research and development expense in the period in which the increase is determined 
similarly  any future decrease in the fair value of the cvr obligation will result in a reduction in research and development expense 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that we acquire that have not been completed at the date of acquisition 
the value assigned to acquired ipr d is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting revenue from the projects  and discounting the net cash flows to present value 
the revenue and costs projections used to value acquired ipr d were  as applicable  reduced based on the probability of developing a new product 
additionally  the projections considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on management s estimates of cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes from such projects 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections described above 
we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date using discounted cash flow models 
these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the ipr d assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date 
if these product candidates are not successfully developed  our sales and profitability will be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired ipr d assets may become impaired 
our annual assessment includes a comparison of the fair value of ipr d to our existing carrying value 
we recognize an impairment when the carrying value is greater than the determined fair value 
we believe that the assumptions used in valuing the ipr d are reasonable and are based upon our best estimate of likely outcomes of our clinical development 
the underlying assumptions and estimates used to value these ipr d assets are subject to change in the future  and actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions and estimates 
our ipr d assets are assessed on an annual basis for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we performed our annual assessment on october  and determined there was no impairment 
on december   abbott terminated our collaboration on tru effective march  in light of this termination  we performed an interim assessment and determined that there was no impairment of the tru ipr d asset as of december  goodwill we assess the carrying value of goodwill annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded and charged to general and administrative expense 
we have determined that all of our goodwill is assigned to our biosciences therapeutics reporting unit  which is a component of our biosciences reporting segment 
we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the income approach 
the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the results of the fair value calculations are then compared to our reporting unit s carrying value 
we have selected october st as our annual impairment test date 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill at october  and determined no impairment existed 
on december  abbott notified us that they were terminating our collaboration agreement effective march  in light of this termination  we performed an interim assessment and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions used in calculating fair value include identifying future cash flows for ongoing development programming  which requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment review 
stock based compensation in accordance with stock based compensation accounting guidance  all equity awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units  are recognized in the income statement based on their estimated grant date fair values 
we determine the grant date fair value of restricted stock units using the closing market price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the grant date fair value of all stock options granted 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the effect of this accounting treatment on net income attributable to emergent biosolutions inc and earnings per share in any period is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the equity awards and the fair value of additional equity awards granted in future years 
financial operations overview revenues on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply up to million doses of biothrax for placement into the sns 
in april  we entered into a modification to this contract to supply an additional million doses at a value of up to million 
the term of the modified agreement was from september  through september  on september  we entered into a further modification of this contract that extended the period of performance of the contract at no additional cost  from september  to december  the total value of the modified contract for million doses was approximately million 
as of december   we completed deliveries of doses under this agreement 
we recognized revenue under the contract upon acceptance of each delivery of biothrax doses to the sns 
effective september   we have a contract with the cdc to supply up to million doses of biothrax over a five year period 
the maximum amount that could be paid to us under the contract is up to billion  subject to availability of funding 
the period of performance under the award is from september  through september  we began delivery of doses under the contract in december through december   we had delivered and  upon cdc acceptance  recognized revenue on approximately  doses under this contract 
we have received contract and grant funding from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  and barda for the following development programs product candidate manufacturing funding source award date performance period anthrivig niaid anthrivig niaid recombinant botulinum vaccine niaid nuthrax niaid thravixa niaid barda nuthrax niaid barda double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine niaid large scale manufacturing for biothrax barda nuthrax niaid previthrax barda our revenue  operating results and profitability have varied  and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis  primarily due to the timing of our fulfilling orders for biothrax and work done under new and existing grants and contracts  including collaborative relationships 
cost of product sales the primary expense that we incur to deliver biothrax to our customers is manufacturing cost  which consist of primarily fixed costs 
these fixed manufacturing costs consist of facilities  utilities and personnel related expenses for indirect manufacturing support staff 
variable manufacturing costs for biothrax consist primarily of costs for materials  direct labor and contract filling operations 
we determine the cost of product sales for doses sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period those doses were manufactured 
we calculate the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period of manufacture by dividing the actual costs of manufacturing in such period by the number of units produced in that period 
in addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above  the average manufacturing cost per dose depends on the efficiency of the manufacturing process  utilization of available manufacturing capacity and the production yield for the period of production 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  fees to professional service providers for  among other things  preclinical and analytical testing  independent monitoring or other administration of our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non clinical studies  costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products  and operating costs  such as the operating costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates 
we expect that spending for our product pipeline will increase as our product development activities continue based on ongoing advancement of our product candidates  and as we prepare for regulatory submissions and other regulatory activities 
we expect that the magnitude of any increase in our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials  participation of third party collaborators  number of product candidates under development  the size  structure and duration of any follow on clinical programs that we may initiate  costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large scale basis for later stage clinical trials  and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies  such as studies involving biothrax conducted by the cdc 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  sales and marketing  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales or research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we currently market and sell biothrax directly to the us government with a small  targeted marketing and sales group 
as we seek to broaden the market for biothrax and if we receive marketing approval for additional products  we expect that we will increase our spending for marketing and sales activities 
total other income expense total other income expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense  and in  a charge to reduce previously accrued interest income related to a settlement agreement with protein sciences corporation  or psc 
we earn interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and in  on a note receivable  and we incur interest expense on our indebtedness 
we capitalize interest expense based on the cost of major ongoing projects which have not yet been placed in service  such as new manufacturing facilities 
some of our existing debt arrangements provide for increasing amortization of principal payments in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources debt financing for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales revenues decreased by million  or  to million for from million for this decrease in product sales revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the number of doses of biothrax delivered 
this decrease was due to the redeployment of our potency testing capacity from biothrax release testing to qualification of replacement reference standards and other development testing during the first quarter of  coupled with lower production yields in the period in which the doses were produced 
product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs and the cdc of million and aggregate international and other sales of million 
product sales revenue in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of million 
contracts and grants revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in contracts and grants revenues was primarily due to revenues from our contract with barda for large scale manufacturing for biothrax and our collaborations with abbott and pfizer  along with increased activity and associated revenue from our development contracts with niaid and barda for nuthrax and previthrax 
contracts and grants revenues in consisted of million in development contract and grant revenue from niaid and barda  million from abbott and pfizer and  from the wellcome trust 
contracts and grants revenue for primarily consisted of million from niaid and barda  million from abbott and pfizer  million related to the us government s therapeutic discovery project program and  from a milestone payment related to the sale of technology rights and related materials to our pertussis technology 
cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased by million  or  to million for from million for this decrease was attributable to the decrease in the number of biothrax doses sold  partially offset by an increase in the cost per dose sold associated with decreased production yields in the period in which the doses were produced 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase primarily reflects higher contract service and personnel related costs  and includes increased expenses of million for product candidates and technology platform development activities that are categorized in the biosciences segment  increased expenses of million for product candidates that are categorized in the biodefense segment  and increased expenses of million in other research and development  which are in support of central research and development activities 
during and  we incurred research and development expenses net of development contract and grant reimbursements along with the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of million and million  respectively 
the increase in spending on biodefense product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts on various programs as we completed various studies and prepared for subsequent studies and trials 
the increase in spending for nuthrax was due to manufacturing  process characterization  assay validation and the conduct of clinical trial activities 
the increase in spending for our large scale manufacturing for biothrax program was primarily due to characterization assay development  validation activities and manufacturing that increased subsequent to the associated development contract award in july the spending for biothrax related programs was related to clinical and non clinical studies to support applications for marketing approval of these programs 
the increase in spending for previthrax was primarily due to formulation development  stability studies and model optimization subsequent to the associated development contract awarded in september the decrease in spending for anthrivig was primarily due to the timing of a clinical trial and animal model development 
the decrease in spending for thravixa was primarily due to the timing of process development  non clinical studies and animal model development 
the decrease in spending for our other biodefense activities was primarily due to decreased spending associated with our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine in light of reduced funding by the us government for this product candidate 
as such  we expect that spending for our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine will be minimal in the future 
the increase in spending on biosciences product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts and the acquisition of certain biosciences product candidates 
the increase in spending for our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is related to the costs incurred for the continued conduct of a phase iib clinical trial along with process development and manufacturing activities 
the increase in spending for our tru  es and x product candidates  is a result of our october acquisition of trubion and its development programs for product candidates to treat certain autoimmune disorders and oncology  and is primarily related to clinical trials  process development and manufacturing costs 
in december  abbott terminated our collaboration for the development and commercialization of tru effective march  as a result of this termination  abbott will no longer share the cost of ongoing development  and as such we anticipate that our costs for this program will increase 
the spending for our zanolimumab product candidate was primarily for upfront and milestone payments related to the may acquisition of certain assets of tenx biopharma  inc the decrease in spending for our influenza vaccine product candidate is related to the timing of process and analytical development 
the decrease in spending for typhella was primarily due to the substantial completion of manufacturing and clinical studies 
we have significantly reduced ongoing spending with regard to typhella while we investigate options to sell or outlicense the related technology  and we expect that future spending will further be reduced 
the increase in spending for our other biosciences activities was primarily due to increased spending associated with development of platform technologies along with preclinical product candidates as a result of our acquisition of trubion 
the spending for other research and development activities was primarily due to central research and development activities not attributable to product candidates

product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of  contracts and grant revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in contracts and grants revenue was primarily due to revenues from our large scale manufacturing for biothrax contract and our collaborations with abbott and pfizer along with increased activity and associated revenue from our development contracts with niaid and barda for nuthrax  previthrax  and our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine 
contracts and grants revenue for primarily consisted of million from niaid and barda  million from abbott and pfizer  million related to the us government s therapeutic discovery project program and  from a milestone payment related to the sale of technology rights and related materials to our pertussis technology 
contracts and grants revenues for consisted of million in development contract revenue from niaid and barda and  from sanofi pasteur under a collaboration agreement that was terminated in december cost of product sales cost of product sales increased by  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of biothrax doses sold  substantially offset by a decrease in cost per dose sold associated with increased production yield in the period during which the doses sold were produced 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase primarily reflects higher contract service and personnel related costs  and includes increased expenses of million for product candidates and technology platform development activities that are categorized in the biosciences segment  increased expenses of million for product candidates that are categorized in the biodefense segment  and decreased expenses of  in other research and development  which are in support of central research and development activities 
during and  we incurred research and development expenses net of development contract and grant reimbursements along with the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of million and million  respectively 
the increase in spending on biodefense product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts on various programs as we completed various studies and prepared for subsequent studies and trials 
the increase in spending for our nuthrax program was due to the conduct of stability and clinical studies along with potency assay development 
the increase in spending for our large scale manufacturing for biothrax program was primarily due to characterization assay and process development that increased subsequent to the associated development contract award in july the decrease in spending for biothrax related programs was related to timing of clinical and non clinical studies to support applications for marketing approval of these programs 
the decrease in spending for our previthrax product candidate was primarily due to reduced spending while awaiting a development contract award from barda  which we received in september the spending for our anthrivig product candidate was primarily for clinical studies  model development and regulatory activities 
the spending for our thravixa product candidate was primarily due to process and formulation development along with safety studies 
the increase in spending for our double mutant recombinant protective antigen anthrax vaccine product candidate resulted from spending for process manufacturing and assay development 
the spending for our botulinum vaccine product candidates resulted from conducting non clinical studies 
the increase in spending on biosciences product candidates  detailed in the table below  was primarily attributable to the timing of development efforts partially offset by the termination or scaling back of certain programs 
the increase in spending for our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is related to the costs incurred for the continued conduct of a phase iib clinical trial  which commenced in april the increase in spending for our tru and sbi product candidates  primarily for clinical studies and manufacturing costs  is due to our october acquisition of trubion and its development programs for product candidates to treat certain autoimmune disorders and cancer  including ra  sle  cll and nhl

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december payments due by period in thousands total after contractual obligations long term indebtedness including current portion operating lease obligations total contractual obligations there are a number of uncertainties that we face in the development of new product candidates that prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license and collaboration agreements 
because of these uncertainties  the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements 
these agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research  development and commercialization milestones  such as the commencement of clinical trials  the receipt of funding awards  the receipt of regulatory approvals  and the achievement of sales milestones 
the amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed  including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed  type and number of components of each product or product candidate  ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected  and the aggregate payments could be as much as approximately million 
the success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates depends on many factors  including those set forth in risk factors our business depends significantly on our success in completing development and commercialization of our product candidates at acceptable costs and is highly uncertain 
even if these efforts are successful  the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable 
the same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates 
we do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position  operations and capital resources because  if payable  we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments 
we are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts 
debt financing as of december   we had million principal amount of debt outstanding  comprised primarily of the following million outstanding under a loan from the department of business and economic development of the state of maryland used to finance eligible costs incurred to purchase our first facility in frederick  maryland  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from pnc bank used to finance the remaining portion of the purchase price for our first frederick facility  million outstanding under a term loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the costs of our facility expansion in lansing  michigan  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the purchase price of our facility in gaithersburg  maryland  million outstanding under a construction loan from pnc bank used to fund the ongoing renovation of our baltimore  maryland facility  and million outstanding under an equipment loan from pnc bank used to fund equipment purchases at our baltimore  maryland facility 
some of our debt instruments contain financial and operating covenants 
in particular under our loan from the state of maryland  we were not required to repay the principal amount of the loan if we maintained a specified number of employees at the frederick site  if we invested at least million in total funds toward financing the purchase of the buildings on the site and for related improvements and operation of the facility  and if we occupied the facility through our plans for this facility have changed  and we currently plan to sell both frederick buildings 
as such we have not met the requirements for the loan to be forgivable 
we have reached an agreement with the state of maryland to repay the loan in full by march   with an earlier repayment due upon sale of the building 
under our mortgage loan from pnc bank for our frederick facility  we are required to maintain at all times a minimum tangible net worth of not less than million 
in addition  we are required to maintain at all times a ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to the sum of current obligations under capital leases and principal obligations and interest expenses for borrowed money  in each case due and payable within the following months  of not less than to under our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation to finance a portion of the costs of our facility expansion in lansing  michigan  we are required to maintain on an annual basis a book leverage ratio of less than

our debt instruments also contain negative covenants restricting our activities

our construction and equipment loans from pnc bank limits our ability to incur indebtedness  make loans and enter into mergers or similar transactions 
the facilities and other equipment that we purchased with the proceeds of our loans from pnc bank  the state of maryland and hsbc realty credit corporation serve as collateral for these loans 
our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation is secured by substantially all of emergent biodefense operations lansing llc assets  other than accounts receivable under our biothrax supply contracts 
our construction loan with pnc bank is secured by our baltimore building along with emergent biodefense operations lansing llc s accounts receivable under our biothrax supply contracts 
our equipment loan with pnc bank is secured by the equipment purchased for our baltimore facility 
the covenants under our existing debt instruments and the pledge of our existing assets as collateral limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
under our mortgage loan from pnc bank  which we modified in october  the fixed annual interest rate is and a monthly payment of  all unpaid principal and interest is due in full in october a residual principal payment of approximately million is due upon maturity in october under our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation  which we refinanced in december  we are required to make monthly principal payments of  a residual principal payment of approximately million is due upon maturity in december interest is payable monthly and accrues at an annual rate equal to the three month libor plus

under our construction loan from pnc bank to finance a portion of the construction and renovation costs at our baltimore  maryland facility  we are required to make monthly interest only payments through july beginning in july  we will be required to make monthly payments of principal and interest based upon a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment for the remaining unpaid principal and interest due in july interest is payable monthly and accrues at an annual rate equal to the libor plus 
under our equipment loan from pnc bank to finance a portion of the equipment purchase for our baltimore  maryland facility  we are required to make monthly interest only payments through august beginning is august  we will be required to make monthly payments of principal and interest based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment for the remaining principal and interest due in august funding requirements we expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from biothrax product sales  collaboration funding  development contract and grant funding  and any lines of credit we may establish from time to time 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biothrax product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may seek additional external financing to provide additional financial flexibility 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of biothrax product sales and cost of product sales  our ability to obtain funding from government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations for our development programs  the acquisition of new facilities and capital improvements to new or existing facilities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  completion of qualification and validation activities related to building  our large scale manufacturing facility in lansing  michigan  the build out of our facility in baltimore  maryland  and any other new facilities  the scope  progress  results and costs of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  other product candidates that we may pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the market acceptance and sales growth of any of our products and product candidates upon regulatory approval  the extent to which our growth generates increased administrative costs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in companies  businesses  products or technologies  and the effect of technological and market developments 
we may require additional sources of funds for future acquisitions that we may make or  depending on the size of the obligation  to meet balloon payments upon maturity of our current borrowings 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
current economic conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing on attractive terms or at all 
lenders may be able to impose covenants on us that could be difficult to satisfy  which could put us at increased risk of defaulting on debt 
if financing is unavailable or lost  we could be forced to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
our ability to borrow amounts under any line of credit we may establish will likely be subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
additional equity or debt financing  grants  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
which deferred certain amendments under asu related to the presentation of reclassification updates 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  after december  we do not anticipate this amendment will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amended asc topic regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in asu no 
states an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
these amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate this amendment will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 which amended asc topic regarding presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments in asu no 
require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not anticipate this amendment will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
which amended asc topic to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
the amendments in asu no 
result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
consequently  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not anticipate this amendment will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that have maturities of less than three months  our investments  and our long term indebtedness 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and the small amount of our non cash investments  which equaled million at december   we believe that an increase in market rates would likely not have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but any increase in market rates would likely increase the interest expense associated with our debt
