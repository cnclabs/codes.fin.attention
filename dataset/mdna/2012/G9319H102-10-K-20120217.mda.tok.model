item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations for the three months ended december  and and for years ended december   and and the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december  and the company completed the acquisition of ipc on september  ipc is included in the company s consolidated results only for the four months ended december  and subsequent fiscal periods and year ends 
this discussion and analysis pertains to the results of the company inclusive of ipc from the date of acquisition 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere within this filing 
for a variety of reasons  the company s historical financial results may not accurately indicate future performance 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
the risk factors set forth in item a above present a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 

table of contents executive overview the company underwrites from two distinct global operating subsidiaries  validus re and talbot 
validus re  the company s principal reinsurance operating subsidiary  operates as a bermuda based provider of short tail reinsurance products on a global basis and incorporates historical ipc business 
talbot  the company s principal insurance operating subsidiary  operates through talbot underwriting ltd  which manages syndicate at lloyd s which writes short tail insurance products on a worldwide basis 
the company s strategy is to concentrate primarily on short tail risks  which is an area where management believes current prices and terms provide an attractive risk adjusted return and the management team has proven expertise 
the company s profitability in any given period is based upon premium and investment revenues less net losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and operating expenses 
financial results in the insurance and reinsurance industry are influenced by the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including as a result of catastrophic events  changes in interest rates  financial markets and general economic conditions  the supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity and changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments 
on september   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ipc the ipc acquisition in exchange for common shares and cash 
ipc s operations focused on short tail lines of reinsurance 
the primary lines in which ipc conducted business were property catastrophe reinsurance and  to a limited extent  property per risk excess  aviation including satellite and other short tail reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
the ipc acquisition was undertaken to increase the company s capital base and gain a strategic advantage in the then current reinsurance market 
this acquisition created a leading bermuda carrier in the short tail reinsurance market that facilitates stronger relationships with major reinsurance intermediaries 
on may   the company joined with other investors in capitalizing alphacat re  a special purpose sidecar reinsurer formed for the purpose of writing collateralized reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance 
at the time of formation  validus re had an equity interest in alphacat re and as validus re held a majority of alphacat re s outstanding voting rights  the financial statements of alphacat re were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
on december   the company completed a secondary offering of common shares of alphacat re to third party investors  along with a partial sale of validus re s common shares to one of the third party investors 
as a result of these transactions  validus re maintained an equity interest in alphacat re  however its share of alphacat re s outstanding voting rights decreased to 
as a result of the company s voting interest falling below  the individual assets and liabilities and corresponding noncontrolling interest of alphacat re have been derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet of the company as at december  and the remaining investment in alphacat re is treated as an equity method investment as at december  the portion of alphacat re s earnings attributable to third party investors for the year ended december  is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 
written premiums are a function of the number and type of contracts written and the prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for reinsurance business tend to be concentrated at the beginning of quarters  with the timing of premiums written varying by line of business 
most property catastrophe business incepts january  april  june and july with an annual policy  while most insurance and specialty lines renewals are more evenly spread throughout the year 
written premiums are generally highest in the first quarter and lowest during the fourth quarter of the year 
gross premiums written for pro rata programs are initially recorded as estimates and are then adjusted as actual results become known 
pro rata reinsurance is a type of reinsurance whereby the reinsurer indemnifies the policyholder against a predetermined portion of losses in return for a proportional share of the direct premiums 
premiums are then generally earned over a month period and paid in monthly or quarterly installments 

table of contents the following are the primary lines in which the company conducts business property validus re underwrites property catastrophe reinsurance  property per risk reinsurance and property pro rata reinsurance 
property catastrophe includes reinsurance for insurance companies exposures to an accumulation of property and related losses from separate policies  typically relating to natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
property per risk provides reinsurance for insurance companies excess retention on individual property and related risks  such as highly valued buildings 
in property pro rata contracts the reinsurer shares the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion with the cedant 
talbot primarily writes direct and facultative property insurance  lineslips and binding authorities and property treaty 
the business written is principally onshore energy  commercial and industrial insurance 
the business is short tail with premiums generally earned within one year and claims generally paid within two years 
marine the company underwrites insurance and reinsurance on marine risks covering damage to or losses of marine vessels or cargo  yachts and marinas  third party liability for marine accidents and physical loss and liability from principally offshore energy properties 
talbot underwrites both marine treaty reinsurance and insurance on a direct and facultative basis 
validus re underwrites marine reinsurance on an excess of loss basis  and to a lesser extent  on a pro rata basis 
specialty the company underwrites other specialty lines with very limited exposure correlation with its property  marine and energy portfolios 
validus re underwrites other lines of business depending on an evaluation of pricing and market conditions  which include aerospace  terrorism  life and accident health and workers compensation catastrophe 
with the exception of the aerospace line of business  which has a meaningful portion of its gross premiums written volume on a proportional basis  validus re s other specialty lines are primarily written on an excess of loss basis 
talbot underwrites war  political risks  political violence  financial institutions  contingency  accident and health  and aviation 
most of the talbot specialty business is written on a direct or facultative basis or through a binding authority or coverholder in conjunction with a significant aviation treaty account 
income from the company s investment portfolio primarily comprises interest income on fixed maturity investments net of investment expenses and net realized unrealized gains losses on investments 
a significant portion of the company s contracts provide short tail coverage for damages resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  which means that the company could become liable for a significant amount of losses on short notice 
accordingly  the company has structured its investment portfolio to preserve capital and maintain a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of the company s investment portfolio consists of short term fixed maturity investments 
the company s fixed income investments are classified as trading 
under us gaap  these securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses are included in net income in the company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  and finance expenses related to debentures  senior notes and our credit facilities 
losses and loss expenses are a function of the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
reserves for losses and loss expenses include a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for losses incurred but not reported 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in losses and loss expenses materially different than the reserve initially established 
changes to prior year loss reserves will affect current underwriting results by increasing net income if a portion of the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or decreasing net income if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
adjustments resulting from new information will be reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
the company s ability to estimate losses 
table of contents and loss expenses accurately  and the resulting impact on contract pricing  is a critical factor in determining profitability 
since most of the lines of business underwritten have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophes  the company expects that claims experience will often be the result of irregular and significant events 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could potentially have a material adverse effect on  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and ability to write new business 
the business written by talbot helps to mitigate these risks by providing us with significant benefits in terms of product line and geographic diversification 
acquisition costs consist principally of brokerage expenses and commissions which are driven by contract terms on reinsurance contracts written  and are normally a specific percentage of premiums 
under certain contracts  cedants may also receive profit commissions which will vary depending on the loss experience on the contract 
acquisition costs are presented net of commissions or fees received on any ceded premium 
general and administrative expenses are generally comprised of expenses which do not vary with the amount of premiums written or losses incurred 
applicable expenses include salaries and benefits  professional fees  office expenses  risk management  and stock compensation expenses 
stock compensation expenses include costs related to the company s long term incentive plan  under which restricted stock are granted to certain employees 
business outlook and trends we underwrite global specialty property insurance and reinsurance and have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made disasters 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events results in substantial volatility  and can have material adverse effects on the company s financial condition and results and ability to write new business 
this volatility affects results for the period in which the loss occurs because us accounting principles do not permit reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur 
catastrophic events of significant magnitude historically have been relatively infrequent  although management believes the property catastrophe reinsurance market has experienced a higher level of worldwide catastrophic losses in terms of both frequency and severity in the period from to the present 
we also expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
the company seeks to reflect these trends when pricing contracts 
property and other reinsurance premiums have historically risen in the aftermath of significant catastrophic losses 
as loss reserves are established  industry surplus is depleted and the industry s capacity to write new business diminishes 
at the same time  management believes that there is a heightened awareness of exposure to natural catastrophes on the part of cedants  rating agencies and catastrophe modeling firms  resulting in an increase in the demand for reinsurance protection 
the global property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industry has historically been highly cyclical 
the company was formed in october in response to the supply demand imbalance resulting from the large industry losses in and in the aggregate  the company observed substantial increases in premium rates in compared to levels 
during the years ended december  and  the company experienced increased competition in most lines of business 
capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers and reinsurers increased the supply of insurance and reinsurance which resulted in a softening of rates in most lines 
however  during  the insurance and reinsurance industry incurred material losses and capital declines due to hurricanes ike and gustav and the global financial crisis 
in the wake of these events  the january renewal season saw decreased competition and increased premium rates due to relatively scarce capital and increased demand 
during  the company observed reinsurance demand stabilization and industry capital recovery from investment portfolio gains 
in  there were few notable large losses affecting the 
table of contents worldwide re insurance industry and no major hurricanes making landfall in the united states 
during  the company continued to see increased competition and decreased premium rates in most classes of business with the exception of offshore energy  latin america  financial institutions and political risk lines 
during there was an increased level of catastrophe activity  principally the chilean earthquake and the deepwater horizon events 
during the january renewal season  validus re increased gross premiums written on its us cat xol lines and decreased gross premiums written in the proportional lines 
in addition  validus re decreased gross premiums written in the international property lines as market conditions dictated 
in the aftermath of s deepwater horizon loss  validus re saw additional opportunities and rate increases in the marine lines 
within its specialty lines  validus re increased gross premiums written in the terrorism lines among other sub classes 
until the third quarter of  premiums within talbot remained relatively stable  then significant price increases were seen across offshore energy  onshore energy and property classes 
most other classes also experienced low level rate increases as the lloyd s market responded to the year s highly publicized catastrophes including the christchurch earthquake  brisbane floods  tohuku earthquake and the thailand floods together with high frequency risk losses 
these increases were offset by some pricing pressure remaining in places  resulting in an overall price increase at a whole account level of for the year to date 
during the january renewal season  the validus re segment underwrote million in gross premiums written  an increase of from the prior year period 
this renewal data does not include talbot s operations as its business is distributed relatively evenly throughout the year 
financial measures the company believes the following financial indicators are important in evaluating performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for shareholders annualized return on average equity represents the level of net income available to shareholders generated from the average shareholders equity during the period 
annualized return on average equity is calculated by dividing the net income for the period by the average shareholders equity during the period 
average shareholders equity is the average of the beginning  ending and intervening quarter end shareholders equity balances 
the company s objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward shareholders for the risks assumed and to grow revenue only when returns meet or exceed internal requirements 
details of annualized return on average equity are provided below 
three months ended december  years ended december  annualized return on average equity the decrease in annualized return on average equity were driven primarily by a decrease in net income available to validus for the three months and year ended december  net income available to validus for the three months ended december  decreased by million  or compared to the three months ended december  due primarily to a decrease in underwriting income 
net income available to validus for the year ended december  decreased by million  or compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increased notable loss events for the year ended december  diluted book value per common share is considered by management to be an appropriate measure of our returns to common shareholders  as we believe growth in our book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth of our stock price 
diluted book value per common share decreased by  or 
table of contents  from at december  to at december  the decrease was due to dividends paid exceeding net income during the year ended december  diluted book value per common share is a non gaap financial measure 
the most comparable us gaap financial measure is book value per common share 
diluted book value per common share is calculated based on total shareholders equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  divided by the sum of common shares  unvested restricted shares  options and warrants outstanding assuming their exercise 
a reconciliation of diluted book value per common share to book value per common share is presented below in the section entitled non gaap financial measures 
cash dividends per common share are an integral part of the value created for shareholders 
the company declared quarterly cash dividends of per common share and common share equivalent in each of the four quarters of on february   the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of per common share and per common share equivalent for which each outstanding warrant is exercisable  payable on march  to holders of record on march  underwriting income measures the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as net investment income loss  other income  finance expenses  net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments  foreign exchange gains losses and gain on bargain purchase  net of expenses 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance operations 
underwriting income for the three months ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
underwriting income for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
underwriting income is a non gaap financial measure as described in detail and reconciled in the section below entitled underwriting income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported and disclosed amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes the following accounting policies are critical to the company s financial reporting as the application of these policies requires management to make significant judgments 
management believes the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are reserve for losses and loss expenses  premiums  reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoverable  and investment valuation 
reserve for losses and loss expenses 
for insurance and reinsurance companies  a significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
the company establishes its reserve for losses and loss expenses to cover the estimated remaining liability incurred for both reported claims case reserves and unreported amounts incurred but not reported or ibnr reserves 
for insurance and reinsurance business  the ibnr reserves include provision for loss incidents that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the company as well as for future variation in case reserves where the claim has been reported but the ultimate cost is not yet known 
within the reinsurance business  the portion of total ibnr related to future variation on known claims is calculated at the individual claim level in some instances either as an additional case reserve or individual claim ibnr 
within the insurance business  the provision for future variation in current case reserves is generally calculated using actuarial estimates of total ibnr  while individual claim ibnr amounts are sometimes calculated for larger claims 
during and  given the complexity and severity of notable loss events  an explicit reserve for potential development on and notable loss events rde was included within the company s ibnr reserving process 
as uncertainties surrounding initial estimates on notable loss events develop  it is expected that this reserve will be allocated to specific notable loss events 

table of contents the requirement for a reserve for potential development on notable loss events in a quarter is a function of a the number of significant events occurring in that quarter and b the complexity and volatility of those events 
these factors are considered in the aggregate for the events occurring in the quarter  recognizing that it is more likely that one or some of the events may deteriorate significantly  rather than all deteriorating proportionately 
the evaluation of each quarter s requirement for a reserve for potential development on notable loss events takes place as part of the quarterly evaluation of the company s overall reserve requirements 
it is not directly linked in isolation to any one significant notable loss in the quarter  and therefore it is not assigned to a contract on the basis of a specific review 
the reserve for potential development on notable loss events is evaluated by our in house actuaries as part of their normal process in setting of indicated reserves for the quarter 
in ensuing quarters the loss reserve committee revisits and re estimates each event previously considered in the catastrophe loss event process  as well as events that have subsequently emerged in the current quarter 
changes to the reserve for potential development on notable loss events will be considered in light of changes to previous loss estimates from notable losses in this re estimation process 
loss reserve estimates for insurance and reinsurance business are not precise in that they deal with the inherent uncertainty in the outcome of insurance and reinsurance claims made on the company  many of which have not yet been reported to the company 
estimating loss reserves requires management to make assumptions  both explicit and implicit  regarding future paid and reported loss development patterns  frequency and severity trends  claims settlement practices  potential changes in the legal environment and other factors 
these estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised over time as additional experience or other data becomes available  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change 
as predominantly a broker market insurer and reinsurer  the company must rely on loss information reported to us by brokers from clients  where such information is often incomplete or changing 
the quality and type of information received varies by client and by the nature of the business  insurance or reinsurance 
in the insurance business  for risks that the company leads  the company receives from brokers details of potential claims  on the basis of which the company s loss adjusters make estimates of the likely ultimate outcome of the claims 
in determining these reserves  the company takes into account a number of factors including the facts and circumstances of the individual claim  the nature of the coverage and historical information about its experience on similar types of claims 
for insurance business where another company is the lead  the case reserves are established by the lead underwriter and validated centrally by the lloyd s market claims bureau  with a sample reviewed by the company 
the sum of the individual claim estimates for lead and follow business constitutes the case reserves 
for reinsurance business  the company typically receives from brokers details of paid losses and estimated case reserves recorded by the ceding company 
in addition to this  the ceding company s estimated provision for ibnr losses is sometimes also available  although this in itself introduces additional uncertainty owing to the differing and typically unknown reserving practices of ceding companies 
there will also be a time lag between a loss occurring and it being reported  first by the original claimant to its insurer  via the insurance broker  and for reinsurance business  subsequently from the insurer to the reinsurer via the reinsurance broker 
the company writes a mix of predominantly short tail business  both insurance and reinsurance 
the combination of low claim frequency and high claim severity that is characteristic of much of this short tail business makes the available data more volatile and less reliable for predicting ultimate losses 
for example  in property lines  there can be additional uncertainty in loss estimation related to large catastrophe events  whether natural or man made 
with winds events  such as hurricanes  the damage assessment process may take more than a year 
the cost of claims is also subject to volatility due to supply 
table of contents shortages for construction materials and labor 
in the case of earthquakes  the damage assessment process may take longer as buildings are discovered to have structural weaknesses not initially detected 
the company also writes longer tail insurance lines of business  predominantly financial institutions million of gross premiums written on a claims made basis and marine and energy liabilities million of gross premiums substantially written on a losses occurring basis for the year ended december  these longer tail lines represent of talbot s gross premiums written for the year ended december  for marine and energy liability  the time from the occurrence of a claim to its first report to the company can be years 
for both marine and energy liability and financial institutions  the subsequent time between reporting of a claim and its settlement can be years 
in these intervening periods between occurrence  reporting and settlement  additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known and current laws and case law may change  affecting the ultimate value of the claim 
taken together  these issues add considerable uncertainty to the process of estimating ultimate losses  hence loss reserves  and this uncertainty is increased for reinsurance business compared with insurance business due to the additional parties in the chain of reporting from the original claimant to the reinsurer 
as a result of the uncertainties described above  the company must estimate ibnr reserves  which consist of a provision for future development on known loss events  as well as a provision for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to us by clients 
because of the degree of reliance that is necessarily placed on brokers and re insured companies for claims reporting  the associated time lag  the low frequency high severity nature of much of the business underwritten  the rapidly emerging and changing nature of facts and circumstances surrounding large events and  for reinsurance business  the varying reserving practices among ceding companies as described above  reserve estimates are highly dependent on management s judgment and are subject to uncertainty 
the company strives to take account of these uncertainties in the judgments and assumptions made when establishing loss reserves  but it is not possible to eliminate the uncertainties 
as a result  there is a risk that the company s actual losses may be higher or lower than the reserves booked 
for the company s insurance business written by talbot  where a longer reserving history exists  the company examines the development of its own historical paid and incurred losses to identify trends  which it then incorporates into the reserving process where it deems appropriate 
for the company s reinsurance business  especially that written by validus re where the company relies more heavily on information provided by clients in order to assist it in estimating reserves  the company performs certain processes in order to help assess the completeness and accuracy of such information as follows in addition to information received from clients on reported claims  the company also uses information on the patterns of client loss reporting and loss settlements from previous events in order to estimate the company s ultimate liability related to these events  the company uses reinsurance industry information in order to perform consistency checks on the data provided by ceding companies and to identify trends in loss reporting and settlement activity 
where it deems appropriate  the company incorporates such information in establishing reinsurance reserves  and for both insurance and reinsurance business  the company supplements the loss information received from clients with loss estimates developed by market share techniques and third party catastrophe models when such information is available 
although there is normally a lag in receiving reinsurance data from cedants  the company currently has no backlog related to the processing of assumed reinsurance information 
the company actively manages its relationships with brokers and clients and considers existing disputes with counterparties to be in the normal course of business 

table of contents as described above  the reserve for losses and loss expenses includes both a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for ibnr reserves 
ibnr reserves are the difference between ultimate losses and reported losses  where reported losses are the sum of paid losses and outstanding case reserves 
ultimate losses are estimated by management using various actuarial methods  including exposure based and loss based methods  as well as other qualitative assessments regarding claim trends 
the company uses a reserving methodology that establishes a point estimate for ultimate losses 
the point estimate represents management s best estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
the company does not select a range as part of its loss reserving process 
the extent of reliance on management judgment in the reserving process differs depending on the circumstances surrounding the estimations  including the volume and credibility of data  the perceived relevance of historical data to future conditions  the stability or lack of stability in the company s operational processes for handling losses including claims practices and systems and other factors 
the company reviews its reserving assumptions and methodologies on a quarterly basis 
two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves are loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios 
loss emergence patterns are critical to the reserving process as they can be one key indicator of the ultimate liability 
a pattern of reported loss emergence different from expectations may indicate a change in the loss climate and may thus influence the estimate of future payments that should be reflected in reserves 
expected loss ratios are a primary component in the company s calculation of estimated ultimate losses for business at an early stage in its development 
loss emergence patterns for the business written by talbot are generally derived from talbot s own historic loss development triangulations  supplemented in some instances by lloyd s market data 
for the business written by validus re  where its own historic loss development triangulations are currently more limited  greater use is made of market data including reinsurance industry data available from organizations such as statistical bureaus and consulting firms  where appropriate 
expected loss ratios are estimated in a variety of ways  largely dependent upon the data available 
wherever it deems appropriate  management incorporates the company s own loss experience in establishing initial expected loss ratios and reserves 
this is particularly true for the business written by talbot where a longer reserving history exists and expected losses and loss ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
for reinsurance business  expected losses and loss ratios are typically developed using vendor and proprietary computer models 
the information used in these models is collected by underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business 
the company has catastrophe event ultimate loss reserve estimation procedures for the investigation  analysis  and estimation of ultimate losses resulting from large catastrophe events 
the determination regarding which events follow these procedures is made by members of senior management from relevant departments within the company 
the procedures are designed to facilitate the communication of information between various relevant functions and provide an efficient approach to determining the estimated loss for the event 
in developing estimates for large catastrophe events  the company considers various sources of information including  specific loss estimates reported by our cedants and policyholders  ceding company and overall insurance industry loss estimates reported by our brokers and by claims reporting services  proprietary and third party vendor models and internal data regarding insured or reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
use of these various sources enables management to estimate the ultimate loss for known events with a higher degree of accuracy and timeliness than if the company relied solely on one data source 
generally  catastrophe event ultimate loss estimates are established without regard to whether we may subsequently contest any claim resulting from the event 
indicated ultimate loss estimates for catastrophe events are compiled by a committee of management  and these indicated ultimate losses are incorporated into the process of selecting management s best estimate of reserves 

table of contents as with large catastrophe events  the company separately estimates ultimate losses for certain large claims using a number of methods  including estimation based on vendor models  analyses of specific industry occurrences and facts  as well as information from cedants and policyholders on individual contract involvements 
management s loss estimates are subject to annual corroborative review by independent actuaries using generally accepted actuarial techniques and other analytical and qualitative methods 
the company s three lines of business  property  marine and specialty  are exposed to event related risks that are generally reported and paid within three years of the event except for financial institutions and energy and marine liability 
the company estimates that of its current reserves will be paid within three years 
the company writes longer tail business in its financial institutions marine and energy liabilities lines 
factors contributing to uncertainty in reserving for these lines include longer duration of loss development patterns  difficulty applying older loss experience to newer years  and the possibility of future litigation 
the company considers these factors when reserving for longer tail lines 
as described above  for all lines of business  the company s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses and loss reserves recoverable consist of three categories case reserves  in certain circumstances  additional case reserves acr  and ibnr reserves 
for both talbot and validus re  ibnr is established separately for large or catastrophe losses and smaller attritional losses 
the reserves and recoverables for attritional and large or catastrophe losses are established on an annual and interim basis as follows case reserves case reserves generally are analyzed and established by each segment s claims department on all lines  making use of third party input where appropriate including  for the reinsurance business  reports of losses from the ceding companies 
for insurance business where talbot is not the lead underwriter on the business  the case reserves are established by the lead underwriter and validated by central lloyd s market claims bureau  with a sample reviewed by talbot 
acr reserves acrs are established for validus re business by our claims department in cases where we believe the case reserves reported by the cedant require adjustment 
acrs supplement case reserves based on information obtained through ceding company audits or other sources 
acrs are not generally used at talbot as claim volumes are generally greater and thus the potential for future variation in case reserve estimates on known claims often can be analyzed at an aggregate level using historical data 
ibnr reserves a 
large or catastrophe events ibnr reserves are established for all lines based on each segment s estimates for known loss events for which not all claims have been reported to the company 
in establishing such ibnr reserves  the company accumulates loss information from modeling agencies  where possible  publicly available sources and information contained in client reports and estimates 
the loss information is applied to the company s book of in force contracts to establish an estimate of the company s ultimate exposure to the loss event 
for some large loss events  the company estimates an ultimate loss expectation for the individual event 
paid losses  case reserves and any additional case reserves are then deducted from the ultimate loss to ascertain the ibnr estimate for these individual large claims or catastrophe events 
the size of event for which the company establishes a separate ultimate loss estimate may vary based on an assessment of the materiality of the event  as well as on other factors 
during and  given the complexity and severity of notable loss events in the year  an explicit reserve for potential development on and notable loss events was included within the company s ibnr reserving process 
as uncertainties surrounding initial notable loss events develop  it is expected that the reserve will be allocated to specific notable loss events 

table of contents b 
attritional losses ibnr reserves are established using some combination of the actuarial methods described above  including the chain ladder method  the generalized cape cod method and the bornhuetter ferguson method 
in situations where limited historic development data is available and or the year being analyzed is more recent less mature  the expected loss method and the bornhuetter ferguson method are more commonly used 
under all methods used at both validus re and talbot  an ultimate loss amount is established 
paid losses  case reserves and any additional case reserves are then deducted from the ultimate loss to ascertain the attritional ibnr reserves 
for all sources of ibnr  net reserves are estimated by first estimating gross ibnr reserves  then estimating reinsurance recoverables on ibnr 
the company s reserving methodology was not changed materially in the year ended december  from the methodology used in the year ended december  for either validus re or talbot 
management s best estimate of the gross reserve for losses and loss expenses and loss reserves recoverable at december  were  million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between gross case reserves and gross ibnr by segment at december  as at december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves gross ibnr total gross reserve for losses and loss expenses validus re talbot eliminations total management s best estimate of the gross reserve for losses and loss expenses and loss reserves recoverable at december  were  million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between gross case reserves and gross ibnr by segment at december  as at december  dollars in thousands gross case reserves gross ibnr total gross reserve for losses and loss expenses validus re talbot eliminations total to the extent insurance and reinsurance industry data is relied upon to aid in establishing reserve estimates  there is a risk that the data may not match the company s risk profile or that the industry s reserving practices overall differ from those of the company and its clients 
in addition  reserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss event take place near the end of an accounting period  particularly if it involves a catastrophic event 
these factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms  may result in losses and loss expenses materially different from the reserves initially established 
changes to prior year 
table of contents reserves will affect current period underwriting income by increasing income if the prior year ultimate losses are reduced or decreasing income if the prior year ultimate losses are increased 
the company expects volatility in results in periods when significant loss events occur because us gaap does not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have both occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim 
as a result  the company is not allowed to record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses 
the company anticipates that claims arising from future events will require the establishment of substantial reserves in future periods 
given the risks and uncertainties associated with the process for estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses  management has performed an evaluation of the potential variability in loss reserves and the impact this variability may have on reported results  financial condition and liquidity 
management s best estimate of the net reserve for losses and loss expenses at december  is  million 
the following tables show the effect on estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses as of december  of a change in two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves loss emergence patterns  accelerated or decelerated by three and six months  and expected loss ratios varied by plus or minus five and ten percent 
management believes that a reasonably likely scenario is represented by such a standard  as used by some professional actuaries as part of their review of an insurer s or reinsurer s reserves 
utilizing this standard as a guide  management has selected these variances to determine reasonably likely scenarios of variability in the loss emergence and loss ratio assumptions 
these scenarios consider normal levels of catastrophe events 
loss reserves may vary beyond these scenarios in periods of heightened or reduced claim activity 
the reserves resulting from the changes in the assumptions are not additive and should be considered separately 
the following tables vary the assumptions employed therein independently 
in addition  the tables below do not adjust any parameters other than the ones described above 
specifically  reinsurance collectability was not explicitly stressed as part of the calculations below 
net reserve for losses and loss expenses at december  sensitivity to loss emergence patterns change in assumption reserve for losses and loss expenses dollars in thousands six month acceleration three month acceleration no change selected three month deceleration six month deceleration net reserve for losses and loss expenses at december  sensitivity to expected loss expenses change in assumption reserve for losses and loss expenses dollars in thousands favorable favorable no change selected unfavorable unfavorable the most significant variance in the above scenarios  six month deceleration in loss emergence patterns  would have the effect of increasing losses and loss expenses by million 

table of contents management believes that the reserve for losses and loss expenses is sufficient to cover expected claims incurred before the evaluation date on the basis of the methodologies and judgments used to support its estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that actual payments will not vary significantly from total reserves 
the reserve for losses and loss expenses and the methodology of estimating such reserve are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
premiums 
for insurance business  written premium estimates are determined from the business plan estimates of premiums by class  the aggregate of underwriters estimates on a policy by policy basis  and projections of ultimate premiums using generally accepted actuarial methods 
in particular  direct insurance premiums are recognized in accordance with the type of contract written 
the majority of our insurance premium is accepted on a direct open market or facultative basis 
we receive a premium which is identified in the policy and recorded as unearned premium on the inception date of the contract 
this premium will typically adjust only if the underlying insured values adjust 
we actively monitor underlying insured values and record adjustment premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
for business written on a facultative basis  although a premium estimate is not contractually stated for the amount of business to be written under any particular facility  an initial estimate of the expected premium written is received from the coverholder via the broker 
our estimate of premium is derived by reference to one or more of the following the historical premium volume experienced by any facility  historical premium volume of similar facilities  the estimates provided by the broker  and industry information on the underlying business 
we actively monitor the development of actual reported premium against the estimates made  where actual reported premiums deviate from the estimate  we carry out an analysis to determine the cause and may  if necessary  adjust the estimated premiums 
in the year ended december   premiums written on a facultative basis accounted for approximately million of total gross premiums written at talbot 
for contracts written on a losses occurring basis or claims made basis  premium income is generally earned proportionately over the expected risk period  usually months 
for all other contracts  comprising contracts written on a risks attaching basis  premiums are generally earned over a month period due to the fact that some of the underlying exposures may attach towards the end of the contract  and such underlying exposures generally have a month coverage period 
the portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as unearned premiums 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  a dollars in thousands gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums gross written premiums proportional non proportional total a the results of operations for ipc are consolidated only from the september date of acquisition 
no pre acquisition results of operations for ipc are presented in the analysis above 
for reinsurance business where the assumed reinsurance premium is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis  reinsurance contracts are generally written prior to the time the underlying direct policies are written by cedants and accordingly cedants must estimate such premiums when purchasing reinsurance coverage 
for excess of loss contracts  the deposit premium is defined in the contract 
the deposit 
table of contents premium is based on the client s estimated premiums  and this estimate is the amount recorded as written premium in the period the risk incepts 
in the majority of cases  these contracts are adjustable at the end of the contract period to reflect the changes in underlying risks during the contract period 
subsequent adjustments  based on reports by the clients of actual premium  are recorded in the period in which the cedant reports are received  which would normally be reported within six months to one year subsequent to the expiration of the contract 
for pro rata reinsurance contracts  an estimate of written premium is recorded in the period in which the risk incepts 
the written premiums estimate is based on the pro rata cession percentage  on information provided by ceding companies and on management s judgment 
management critically evaluates the information provided by ceding companies based on experience with the cedant  broker and the underlying book of business 
throughout the term of the policy  periodic review of the estimated premium takes place based on the latest information available  which may include actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as an assessment of relevant economic conditions 
if necessary  subsequent adjustments are recorded at the time of review 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the appropriateness of these premium estimates based on the latest information available  which may include actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as an assessment of relevant economic conditions 
as the company s reinsurance lines have a short operating history  we have limited past history that reflects how our premium estimates will develop 
furthermore  past experience may not be indicative of how future premium estimates develop 
the company believes that reasonably likely changes in assumptions made in the estimation process would not have a significant impact on gross premiums written as recorded 
where contract terms on excess of loss contracts require the mandatory reinstatement of coverage after a client s loss  the mandatory reinstatement premiums are recorded as written and earned premiums when the loss event occurs 
management includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of cedants in the review process above  primarily based on market knowledge  reports from rating agencies  the timeliness of cedants payments and the status of current balances owing 
based on this assessment  management believes that as at december  no provision for doubtful accounts is necessary for receivables from cedants 
reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoverables 
as discussed in item business underwriting risk management  the company primarily uses ceded reinsurance for risk mitigation purposes 
talbot purchases reinsurance on an excess of loss and a proportional basis together with a relatively small amount of facultative reinsurance and ilws 
validus re purchases reinsurance on an excess of loss and a proportional basis together with ilw coverage 
for excess of loss business  the amount of premium payable is usually contractually documented at inception and management judgment is only necessary in respect of any loss related elements of the premium  for example reinstatement or adjustment premiums  and loss related commissions 
the full premium is recorded at inception and if the contract is purchased on a losses occurring during basis  the premium is earned on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
if the policy is purchased on a risks attaching during basis  the premium is earned in line with the inwards gross premiums to which the risk attaching relates 
after the contract has expired  a no claims bonus may be received for certain policies  and this is recorded as a reinsurance premium adjustment in the period in which it can be reasonably determined 

table of contents reinsurance receivable and reinsurance recoverable balances include amounts owed to us in respect of paid and unpaid ceded losses and loss expenses  respectively 
the balances are presented net of a reserve for non recoverability 
as at december   reinsurance recoverable balances were million and paid losses recoverable balances were million 
in establishing our reinsurance recoverable balances  significant judgment is exercised by management in determining the amount of unpaid losses and loss expenses to be ceded as well as our ability to cede losses and loss expenses under our reinsurance contracts 
our ceded unpaid losses and loss expense consists of two elements  those for reported losses and those for losses incurred but not reported ibnr 
ceded amounts for ibnr are developed as part of our loss reserving process 
consequently  the estimation of ceded unpaid losses and loss expenses is subject to similar risks and uncertainties in the estimation of gross ibnr see reserve for losses and loss expenses 
as at december   ceded ibnr recoverable balances were million 
although our reinsurance receivable and reinsurance recoverable balances are derived from our determination of contractual provisions  the recoverability of such amounts may ultimately differ due to the potential for a reinsurer to become financially impaired or insolvent or for a contractual dispute over contract language or coverage 
consequently  we review our reinsurance recoverable balances on a regular basis to determine if there is a need to establish a provision for non recoverability 
in performing this review  we use judgment in assessing the credit worthiness of our reinsurers and the contractual provisions of our reinsurance agreements 
as at december   we had a provision for non recoverability of million 
in the event that the credit worthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for non recoverability 
the company uses a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be uncollectible 
default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions 
at december   the use of different assumptions within the model could have an effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
to the extent the creditworthiness of the company s reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes  actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than the company s provision 
investment valuation 
consistent with us gaap  the company recognizes fixed maturity and short term investments at their fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
us gaap also established a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon whether the inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability are observable or unobservable in the market at the measurement date  with quoted market prices being the highest level level and unobservable inputs being the lowest level level 
generally  the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments inversely correlates with the availability of observable inputs 
all of the company s fixed maturity and short term investment fair value measurements have either quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
the company s external investment accounting service provider receives prices from independent pricing sources to measure the fair values of its fixed maturity investments 
these independent pricing sources are prioritized with respect to reliability to ensure that only the highest priority pricing inputs are used 
the independent pricing sources are received via automated feeds from indices  pricing and broker dealers services 
pricing is also obtained from other external investment managers 
this information is 
table of contents applied consistently across all portfolios 
the company s external investment accounting service provider confirms and documents all prices received from broker dealers on a daily basis for quality control and audit purposes 
in addition to internal controls  management relies on the effectiveness of the valuation controls in place at the company s external investment accounting service provider supported by a ssae report in conjunction with regular discussion and analysis of the investment portfolio s structure and performance 
to date  management has not noted any issues or discrepancies related to investment valuation 
the company s investment custodian performs independent monthly valuations of the investment portfolio using available market prices 
management obtains this information from the company s investment custodian s internet based reporting system and compares it to valuations received from the company s external investment accounting service provider 
other investments consist of an investment in a fund of hedge funds  a private equity investment and a deferred compensation trust held in mutual funds 
the fund administrator provides monthly reported net asset values nav with a one month delay in its valuation 
as a result  the fund administrator s november  nav was used as a partial basis for fair value measurement in the company s december  balance sheet 
the fund investment manager provides an estimate of the performance of the fund for the following month based on the estimated performance provided from the underlying third party funds 
the company utilizes the fund investment manager s primary market approach estimated nav that incorporates relevant valuation sources on a timely basis 
as this valuation technique incorporates both observable and significant unobservable inputs  the fund of hedge funds is classified as a level asset 
to determine the reasonableness of the estimated nav  the company assesses the variance between the estimated nav and the one month delayed fund administrator s nav 
immaterial variances are recorded in the following reporting period 
during the fourth quarter of  a majority of the fund of hedge funds was redeemed 
the remaining portion is a side pocket of million at december  while a redemption request has been submitted  the timing of receipt of proceeds on the side pocket is indeterminable refer to item a

dollars in thousands three months ended december  of sub total three months ended december  of sub total change validus re talbot sub total corporate eliminations total the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting income  as set out in the table below  is reconciled to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by the addition or subtraction of certain consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income line items  as illustrated below 
dollars in thousands three months ended december  three months ended december  underwriting income net investment income other income finance expenses net realized gains losses on investments net unrealized gains losses on investments foreign exchange gains transaction expenses tax expense benefit net income underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 

table of contents the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining the total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income

selected ratios the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its combined ratio  which is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio

the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap measure as previously defined

underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 
the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net 
table of contents income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income

during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million was driven primarily by increased levels of underwriting net premiums written arising from the impact of the ipc acquisition in late a significant portion of the incurred losses had yet to be paid as of december   which resulted in cash provided from operating activities for the period being higher than net income for the period 
net cash provided by investing activities of million was driven primarily by the net sales of short term securities of million and a decrease in securities lending collateral of million 
the decrease in securities lending collateral was due to the winding down of the securities lending program beginning in the third quarter of net cash used in financing activities of million was driven primarily by the purchase of million of common shares under the company s share repurchase program and the payment of million in quarterly dividends  partially offset by the issuance million of senior notes due we anticipate that cash flows from operations will continue to be sufficient to cover cash outflows under our contractual commitments as well as most loss scenarios through the foreseeable future

as a result  it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from such estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in loss severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation  litigation and tort reform 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which the company has operated  thereby providing limited claims loss emergence patterns specifically for the company 
the lack of historical information for the company has necessitated the use of industry loss emergence patterns in deriving ibnr 
further  expected losses and loss ratios are typically developed using vendor and proprietary computer models and these expected loss ratios are a material component in the calculation deriving ibnr 
actual loss ratios will deviate from expected loss ratios and ultimate loss ratios will be greater or less than expected loss ratios 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability will exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the actual payment of the reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts

the uk government has set out proposals to replace the current system of financial regulation  which it believes has weaknesses  with a new regulatory framework 
the key weakness it identified was that no single institution has the responsibility  authority and tools to monitor the financial system as a whole  and respond accordingly 
that power will be given to the bank of england 
the uk government intends to create a new 
table of contents financial policy committee fpc within the bank  which will look at the wider economic and financial risks to the stability of the system 
in addition  the fsa will cease to exist in its current form  and the uk government will create two new focused financial regulators a new financial conduct authority fca will have a strong mandate for promoting confidence and transparency in financial services and to give greater protection for consumers of financial services 
the financial services bill was introduced to parliament on january  subject to the parliamentary timetable the uk government s aim is for the bill to gain royal assent by the end of  and for the new system to be operational in early lloyd s is keeping abreast of these developments and lobbying on behalf of the market when necessary

accordingly  the company s investment portfolio is structured to provide significant liquidity and preserve capital  which means the investment portfolio contains a significant amount of relatively short term fixed maturity investments  such as us government securities  us government sponsored enterprises securities  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities

the impairment analysis of goodwill was performed in line with accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu which was released in september the assessment included a qualitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
reporting units are consistent with the segmental basis 
based on this analysis  management has concluded that an impairment valuation is not required against the carried goodwill 
the impairment analysis for intangibles was performed which included an evaluation of the fair value of talbot relative to its book value on the following basis gross premium written for and  internal demand for and valuation of syndicate capacity  and utilization of lloyd s licenses  and external demand for syndicate capacity

cash flows during the year ended december  and  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operations generally represent premiums collected  investment earnings realized and investment gains realized less losses and loss expenses paid and underwriting and other expenses paid 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially from net income 
as of december  and december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the company has written certain re insurance business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this results in volatility in both results and operational cash flows 
the potential for large claims or a series of claims under one or more reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may be required within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
management believes the company s unused credit facility amounts and highly liquid investment portfolio are sufficient to support any potential operating cash flow deficiencies 
please refer to the table detailing the company s borrowings and credit facilities as at december   presented above 
in addition to relying on premiums received and investment income from the investment portfolio  the company intends to meet these cash flow demands by carrying a substantial amount of short and medium term investments that would mature  or possibly be sold  prior to the settlement of expected liabilities 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that it will successfully match the structure of its investments with its liabilities due to uncertainty related to the timing and severity of loss events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  liquidity risk  and inflation risk 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio falls and the company has the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will be trading at depreciated values 
as interest rates decline  the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio increases and the company has reinvestment risk  as funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of the insurance and reinsurance liabilities the company assumes 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates based on us treasury yield would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates based on us treasury yield would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the company held million december  million  or december   of the company s fixed maturity portfolio in asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying loans increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
the adverse impact of prepayment is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
as a result  the company will be exposed to reinvestment risk  as cash flows received by the company will be accelerated and will be reinvested at the prevailing interest rates 
foreign currency risk certain of the company s reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss 
foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed 
therefore  we manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities were held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total liabilities held in foreign currencies was non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities were held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total liabilities held in foreign currencies were non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
when necessary  we may also use derivatives to economically hedge un matched foreign currency exposures  specifically forward contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
for further information on the accounting treatment of our foreign currency derivatives  refer to item  note derivative instruments used in hedging activities  of the consolidated financial statements 
to the extent foreign currency exposure is not hedged or otherwise matched  the company may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us 
the company s primary credit risks reside in investment in us corporate bonds and recoverable from reinsurers 
we limit our credit exposure by purchasing high quality fixed income investments to maintain an average portfolio credit quality of aa or higher with mortgage and commercial mortgage backed issues having an aggregate weighted average credit quality of aaa 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single issuer to or less of total investments  excluding treasury and agency securities 
with the exception of the bank loan portfolio the company s investment guidelines require that investments be rated bbb or higher at the time of purchase 
where investments are downgraded below bbb baa  we permit our investment managers to hold up to in aggregate market value  or up to with written authorization of the company 
at december   of the portfolio  excluding bank loans was below bbb baa and we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of total investments  other than with respect to government securities 
the amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of the company s financial assets 
the company s primary credit risks reside in investment in us corporate bonds and recoverables from reinsurers 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from its exposure to individual reinsurers 
the reinsurance program is generally placed with reinsurers whose rating  at the time of placement  was a or better rated by s p or the equivalent with other rating agencies 
exposure to a single reinsurer is also controlled with restrictions dependent on rating 
at december   of reinsurance recoverables which includes loss reserves recoverable and recoverables on paid losses were from reinsurers rated a or above  december  rated a or from reinsurers posting full collateral 
liquidity risk certain of the company s investments may become illiquid 
disruption in the credit markets may materially affect the liquidity of the company s investments  including non agency residential mortgage backed securities and bank loans which represent december  of total cash and investments 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophic event in a period of market illiquidity  the investments may be difficult to sell in a timely manner and may have to be disposed of for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions 
at december   the company had  million of unrestricted  liquid assets  defined as unpledged cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  government and government agency securities 
details of the company s debt and financing arrangements at december  are provided below
