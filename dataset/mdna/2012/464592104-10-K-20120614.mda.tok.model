our net line of credit availability at april  was approximately million as limited by our senior secured leverage covenant 
capital expenditures and development activities as part of our business development activities  historically we have entered into agreements which have resulted in the acquisition or development of businesses or assets 
these business development efforts and related agreements typically require the expenditure of cash  which may be significant 
the amount and timing of our cash expenditures relating to development activities may vary based upon our evaluation of current and future development opportunities  our financial condition and the condition of the financing markets 
our development activities are subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to obtaining permits  licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies  legislative changes and  in certain circumstances  negotiating acceptable leases 
construction is proceeding ahead of schedule for our isle casino cape girardeau development 
we anticipate opening by november   subject to regulatory approvals 
we currently estimate the cost of the project at approximately million and have incurred capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  of million through april  in fiscal  we plan to invest approximately million in project capital in our cape girardeau development project  barring any delays related to licensing and permitting  contractor negotiations  weather or other items 
our proposed casino in nemacolin  pennsylvania was selected by the pennsylvania gaming control board to receive the final resort gaming license in pennsylvania in april this award has been appealed to the pennsylvania supreme court by another applicant 
we have a development and management agreement with nemacolin woodlands resort to build and operate a casino with slot machines and table games 
subject to a successful ruling in the appeal and the receipt of all regulatory and other approvals  we expect to complete construction of the facility within approximately nine months after commencing construction 
we currently estimate the cost of the project at approximately million 
to date  we have incurred capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  of million 
the timing of additional significant expenditures is dependent upon resolution of the appeal 
historically  we have made significant investments in property and equipment and expect that our operations will continue to demand ongoing investments to keep our properties competitive 

table of contents we have identified several capital projects primarily focused on refreshing our hotel room inventory as well as additional improvements to our black hawk and lake charles properties  and further lady luck conversions 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced improvements to the hotel at our lake charles property and began rebranding our vicksburg property to a lady luck 
additionally we expect to make several other improvements to our properties including additional farmers pick buffets and other food and beverage outlets as well as ongoing maintenance capital 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million to million in fiscal related to these items 
the timing  completion and amount of additional capital projects will be subject to improvement of economic and local market conditions  cash flows from our continuing operations and borrowing availability under our credit facility 
typically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures through operating cash flow and debt financing 
while we believe that cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for our planned and necessary expenditures or that the level of our capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms if our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient or if we fail to stay in compliance with the covenants of our credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that  if they were to change from period to period  likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  representing of total assets 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  if necessary  we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  or on an interim basis if indicators of impairment exist 
for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each reporting unit to carrying value 
we must make various assumptions and estimates in performing our impairment testing 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable 
table of contents assumptions which represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets including their eventual disposition and by a market approach based upon valuation multiples for similar companies 
changes in estimates  increases in our cost of capital  reductions in transaction multiples  operating and capital expenditure assumptions or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
we engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist management in our annual impairment testing 
based upon our fiscal annual impairment testing  we noted reporting units with goodwill and or other long lived intangibles had fair values which exceeded their carrying values by at least  except for our lula and black hawk reporting units 
in conjunction with this impairment testing  we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill at our lula property of million  resulting in a remaining goodwill balance of million 
black hawk s goodwill and indefinite lived assets as of april  were million  which fair value exceeded its carrying value by 
property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation of million  representing of our total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property or equipment nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition  changes in technology and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment in accordance with the guidance in the impairment or disposal of long lived assets subsection of asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc topic 
for a long lived asset to be held and used  we review the asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of such property  equipment and other long lived assets  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values 
if these estimates or the related assumptions are not achieved or change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
in evaluating impairment of long lived assets for newly opened operations  estimates of future cash flows and residual values may require some period of actual results to provide the basis for an opinion of future cash flows and residual values used in the determination of an impairment loss for these assets 
for assets held for disposal  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value  less cost of disposal based upon appraisals  discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
during fiscal  following our agreement to sell our biloxi property  we recognized an impairment loss of million in discontinued operations related to the assets held for sale 
we also recognized during fiscal an impairment charge of million related to the sale of certain long lived assets at our lake charles property 
self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation and general liabilities 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue a discounted 
table of contents estimate for workers compensation liability and general liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the ultimate cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
based upon our current accrued insurance liabilities  a change in our discount factor would cause a million change in our accrued self insurance liability 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with the guidance in asc topic  income taxes asc topic 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states in which we operate 
we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year 
additionally  we are required to recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences 
temporary differences occur when differences arise between a the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and b the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
deferred tax assets recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that  in our judgment and based upon available evidence  may not be realizable 
at april  we have reduced our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance of million 
we assess our tax positions using a two step process 
a tax position is recognized if it meets a more likely than not threshold  and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized 
uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date 
liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts  and are classified as current or long term in the balance sheet based on the time until expected payment in accounts accrued liabilities other or other long term liabilities  respectively 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
stock based compensation we apply the guidance of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic in accounting for stock compensation 
generally  we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the estimate of the fair value of the stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
this model requires the use of various assumptions  including the historical volatility of our stock price  the risk free interest rate  estimated expected life of the grants  the estimated dividend yield and estimated rate of forfeitures 
subsequent to our fiscal year ended april   we granted restricted stock units rsus containing market performance conditions which will determine the amount of shares to vest  if any 
the fair value of these rsus is determined utilizing a lattice pricing model which considers a range of assumptions including volatility and risk free interest rates 
stock based compensation expense is included in the expense category corresponding to the employees regular compensation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
derivative instruments we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we may designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses related to the change in the market value 
table of contents are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that unacceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the hedged financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
our current interest rate swap agreements  which were designated as cash flow hedges  became ineffective upon the amendment of our senior secured credit facility in february we record them at fair value and measure their effectiveness using the long haul method 
the effective portion of any gain or loss on our interest rate swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
we use the hypothetical derivative method to measure the ineffective portion of our interest rate swaps 
the ineffective portion  if any  is recorded in other income expense 
we measure the mark to market value of our interest rate swaps using a discounted cash flow analysis of the projected future receipts or payments based upon the forward yield curve on the date of measurement 
we adjust this amount to measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps by applying a credit valuation adjustment to the mark to market exposure profile 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the guidance of asc topic contingencies asc topic 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  future operating results could be impacted 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides information as of the end of fiscal  about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the table presents contractual obligations by due dates and related contractual commitments by expiration dates in millions 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt estimated interest payments on long term debt operating leases long term obligations construction contractual obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations estimated interest payment on long term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding at our fiscal year end and forecasted libor rates for our senior secured credit facility 
long term obligations include future purchase commitments 
construction contractual obligations represent the estimated remaining capital expenditures on the construction of our new casino in cape girardeau  missouri 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  which amends asc intangibles goodwill and other 
this update permits entities to make a qualitative assessment of whether a reporting unit s fair value is  more likely than not  less than its carrying amount 
if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the entity is not required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
during fiscal  we adopted this standard  which did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which allows for the presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  the guidance eliminates the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december  while the adoption will impact where we disclose the components of other comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on those consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior secured credit facility 
senior secured credit facility during fiscal  we maintained interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap arrangements with an aggregate notional value of million and million as of april   respectively 
the swap agreement effectively converts portions of the senior secured credit facility variable debt to a fixed rate basis until the swap agreement terminates  which occurs in fiscal the following table provides information at april  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
