item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background viropharma incorporated is a global biotechnology company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products that address serious diseases  with a focus on products used by physician specialists or in hospital settings 
we intend to grow through sales of our marketed products  through continued development of our product pipeline  expansion of sales into additional territories outside the united states  through potential acquisition or licensing of products and product candidates and the acquisition of companies 
we expect future growth to be driven by sales of vancocin  sales of cinryze  both domestically and internationally  sales of buccolam and plenadren in europe  and by our primary development programs  including c esterase inhibitor and a non toxigenic strain of c 
difficile vp 
we market and sell cinryze in the united states for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema hae 
cinryze is a c esterase inhibitor therapy for routine prophylaxis against hae  also known as c inhibitor c inh deficiency  a rare  severely debilitating  life threatening genetic disorder 
cinryze was acquired in october and in january  we acquired expanded rights to commercialize cinryze and future c inh derived products in certain european countries and other territories throughout the world as well as rights to develop future c inh derived products for additional indications 
in june  the european commission granted us centralized marketing authorization for cinryze in adults and adolescents with hae for routine prevention  pre procedure prevention and acute treatment of angioedema attacks 
the approval also includes a self administration option for appropriately trained patients 
we have begun to commercialize cinryze in europe and continue to evaluate our commercialization plans in countries where we have distribution rights 
we also market and sell vancocin hcl capsules  the oral capsule formulation of vancomycin hydrochloride  in the us and its territories 
vancocin is indicated for the treatment of c 
difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
vancocin capsules are also used for the treatment of enterocolitis caused by staphylococcus aureus  including methicillin resistant strains 
on december   we announced the modernization of labeling for vancocin capsules made effective through the fda s approval of a supplemental new drug application snda 
on november   we acquired a ownership interest in duocort pharma ab duocort  a private company based in helsingborg  sweden focused on improving glucocorticoid replacement therapy for treatment of adrenal insufficiency  or addison s disease ad 
we paid approximately million swedish krona sek or approximately million in upfront consideration 
we have also agreed to make additional payments ranging from sek million up to sek million or approximately million to million  contingent on the achievement of certain milestones 
up to sek million or approximately million of the contingent payments relate to specific regulatory milestones  and up to sek million or approximately million of the contingent payments are related to commercial milestones based on the success of the product 
as part of the closing of this transaction  we also paid approximately sek million or million to certain of duocort s creditors 
we incurred approximately million of transaction cost as part of this acquisition 
the acquisition of duocort further expands our orphan disease commercial product portfolio 
on november   the european commission ec granted european marketing authorization for plenadren hydrocortisone  modified release tablet  an orphan drug for treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults  which will bring these patients their first pharmaceutical innovation in over years 
we anticipate commercial launch of plenadren in the eu in late or early a named patient program is currently available to patients in europe  which we expect to continue until commercial launch 

table of contents in may  we acquired auralis limited  a uk based specialty pharmaceutical company 
the acquisition of auralis provides us with the opportunity to accelerate our european commercial systems for potential future product launches and additional business development acquisitions 
in connection with the auralis acquisition  we acquired buccolam oromucosal solution  midazolam 
as hydrochloride in september of  the european commission granted a centralized pediatric use marketing authorization puma for buccolam  for treatment of prolonged  acute  convulsive seizures in infants  toddlers  children and adolescents  from months to less than years of age 
we have begun to commercialize buccolam in europe 
our product development portfolio is primarily focused on three programs  c esterase inhibitor 
human  vp and vp we are working on developing further therapeutic uses  potential additional indications in other c mediated diseases  and alternative modes of administration for c esterase inhibitor 
we are currently undertaking studies on the viability of subcutaneous administration of cinryze 
we intend to conduct viropharma sponsored studies and investigator initiated studies iis to identify further therapeutic uses and potentially expand the labeled indication for cinryze to include other c mediated diseases 
we are also conductiong our own studies of ciryze in antibody mediated rejection amr and delayed graft function dgf 
additionally  in may  halozyme therapeutics halozyme granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use halozyme s proprietary enhanze technology  a proprietary drug delivery platform using halozyme s recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme rhuph technology in combination with a c esterase inhibitor 
we intend to apply rhuph initially to develop an alternative subcutaneous formulation of cinryze for routine prophylaxis against attacks of hae 
in september  we initiated a phase study to evaluate the safety  and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous administration of cinryze in combination with rhuph we are also developing vp for the treatment and prevention of cdad 
in may  we initiated a phase dose ranging clinical study to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of vp for prevention of recurrence of cdad in adults previously treated for cdad 
on september   we entered into a license agreement for the worldwide rights of intellect neurosciences  inc ins to its clinical stage drug candidate  vp  which we expect to develop for the treatment of friedreich s ataxia fa  a rare  hereditary  progressive neurodegenerative disease 
vp  or indole propionic acid  is a naturally occurring  small molecule that has potent anti oxidant properties that can protect against neurodegenerative disease 
in a recent phase safety and tolerability study conducted in the netherlands  vp was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels tested 
we expect to initiate a phase study within to months of the date of this agreement  after completion of longer term toxicology studies 
we intend to file for orphan drug designation upon review of the phase proof of concept data 
under the terms of the agreement  we have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize vp for the treatment  management or prevention of any disease or condition covered by intellect s patents 
we paid ins a million up front licensing fee and may pay additional milestones up to million based upon defined events 
we will also pay a tiered royalty of up to a maximum percentage of low teens  based on annual net sales 
in addition to these programs  we have several other assets that we may make additional investments in 
these investments will be limited and dependent on our assessment of the potential future commercial success of or benefits from the asset 
these assets include maribavir for cmv  recombinant c inh and other compounds 
on december   we entered into an exclusive development and option agreement with meritage pharma  inc meritage  a private company based in san diego  ca focused on developing oral budesonide suspension obs as a treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis eoe 
eoe is a newly recognized chronic disease that is increasingly being diagnosed in children and adults 
it is characterized by inflammation and accumulation of a 
table of contents specific type of immune cell  called an eosinophil  in the esophagus 
eoe patients may have persistent or relapsing symptoms  which include dysphagia difficulty in swallowing  nausea  stomach pain  chest pain  heartburn  loss of weight and food impaction 
we have an exclusive option to acquire meritage  at our sole discretion  by providing written notice at any time during the period from december  to and including the date that is the earlier of a the date that is business days after the later of i the receipt of the final study data for the phase study and ii identification of an acceptable clinical end point definition for a pivotal induction study agreed to by the fda 
as consideration for the option  we paid an initial million and have the option to provide meritage up to an additional million for the development of obs 
meritage will utilize the funding to conduct additional phase clinical assessment of obs 
if we exercise this option  we have agreed to pay million for all of the outstanding capital stock of meritage 
meritage stockholders could also receive additional payments of up to million  upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
we intend to continue to evaluate in licensing or other opportunities to acquire products in development  or those that are currently on the market 
we plan to seek products that treat serious or life threatening illnesses with a high unmet medical need  require limited commercial infrastructure to market  and which we believe will provide both revenue and earnings growth over time 
executive summary since december   we experienced the following business activities cinryze shipped approximately  doses of cinryze to specialty pharmacy specialty distributors sp sd s  the european commission granted us centralized marketing authorization for cinryze in adults and adolescents with hae for routine prevention  pre procedure prevention and acute treatment of angioedema attacks and we began commercial sales of cinryze in europe in the fourth quarter of announced a collaboration with halozyme for combination of halozyme s recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme rhuph technology with a c esterase inhibitor and initiated a phase study to evaluate the safety  and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous administration of cinryze in combination with rhuph from which we receieved positive top line data from the trial  and  initiated a phase clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of c esterase inhibitor 
human 
for the treatment of acute antibody mediated rejection amr in recipients of donor specific cross match positive kidney transplants and withdrew cinryze from the register of orphan medicinal products of the ema  c 
difficile infection cdad announced the modernization of labeling for vancocin capsules made effective through the fda s approval of a supplemental new drug application snda  initiated a phase dose ranging clinical study to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of vp for prevention of recurrence of cdad in adults previously treated for cdad  and  vancocin scripts decreased in as compared to  buccolam received a puma pediatric use marketing authorization for buccolam from the european commission and we began commercial sales of buccolam in europe in the fourth quarter of  
table of contents business development entered into the ins license agreement  acquired duocort  and  entered into the development and option agreement with meritage  financial results net sales of cinryze increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net sales of vancocin increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and  reported net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity generated net cash from operations of million  ended with working capital of million which includes cash and cash equivalents of million and investments of million  entered into million revolving credit facility  and  repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million during and going forward  we expect to face a number of challenges  which include the following the commercial sale of approved pharmaceutical products is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future vancocin sales will meet or exceed the historical rate of sales for the product  for reasons that include  but are not limited to  generic and non generic competition for vancocin and or changes in prescribing habits or disease incidence 
the fda convened a meeting of its advisory committee for pharmaceutical science and clinical pharmacology to discuss bioequivalence recommendations for oral vancomycin hydrochloride capsule drug products on august  the advisory committee was asked if the proposed guidelines are sufficient for establishing bioequivalence for generic vancomycin oral capsules 
the advisory committee voted unanimously in favor of the component of the proposed ogd recommendation that requires bioequivalence to be demonstrated through comparable dissolution in media of ph  and for potential vancomycin hcl capsule generic products that a contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same amounts as vancocin hcl capsules  b meet currently accepted standards for assay  potency  purity  and stability equivalent to those in place for vancocin hcl capsules  and c are manufactured according to cgmp 
we have opposed both the substance of the fda s bioequivalence method and the manner in which it was developed 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with the positions stated in our vancocin related submissions or that our efforts to oppose the ogd s march and december recommendation to determine bioequivalence to vancocin through in vitro dissolution testing will be successful 
on december   we announced the modernization of labeling for vancocin capsules made effective through the fda s approval of a supplemental new drug application snda 
through the snda approval  vancocin s label for the first time includes clinical safety and efficacy data for the use of vancocin capsules in treating clostridium difficile 
vancocin s labeling now reflects safety and efficacy data from patients with c 
difficile associated diarrhea cdad treated with vancocin in two pivotal studies 
table of contents of genzyme corporation s investigational drug  tolevamer 
we purchased exclusive rights to the two studies from genzyme for which we will pay genzyme royalties of percent  percent and percent on net sales of vancocin for the three year period following the approval of the snda 
as a result of the snda approval  we believe vancocin meets the requirements for three years of exclusivity  and that generic vancomycin capsules will not be approved during this period 
under fda s regulations  labeling changes based on new clinical investigations that are essential to approval of the snda and to which the applicant has exclusive rights may be entitled to three years of exclusivity  and generic drug labeling cannot include information protected by such three year exclusivity 
a generic may seek approval by omitting labeling protected by three year exclusivity  however  if such omissions render the generic drug less safe or effective  it cannot be approved until the three year exclusivity expires 
we believe that attempting to omit vancocin labeling changes protected by exclusivity would render generic versions of vancocin less safe and effective 
however  ultimately  the decision on a grant of three year exclusivity and its effect on generic vancomycin capsule approvals resides with the fda 
we cannot predict the timeframe in which the fda will make a decision regarding either our citizen petition for vancocin or the approval of generic versions of vancocin 
if fda s proposed bioequivalence method for vancocin becomes effective  and either fda does not agree that our labeling changes made effective through our snda warrant exclusivity  or fda acknowledges such exclusivity but nonetheless determines that generic products would be no less safe or effective in the absence of such labeling changes  then the time period in which a generic competitor could be approved would be reduced and multiple generics may enter the market 
the approval of generic copies of vancocin would materially impact our operating results  cash flows and possibly intangible asset valuations 
this could also result in a reduction to the useful life of the vancocin related intangible assets 
management currently believes there are no indicators that would require a change in useful life as management believes that vancocin will continue to be utilized along with generics that may enter the market  and the number of generics and the timing of their market entry is unknown 
approval of new products  or expanded use of currently available products  to treat cdad  and particularly severe disease caused by c 
difficile infection  could materially and adversely affect our sales of vancocin 
the number of units sold of vancocin for the treatment of c 
difficile associated diarrhea has increased over the past months but vancocin s share of the us market for this indication may decrease due to competitive forces and market dynamics 
in may  fda approved optimer pharmaceuticals product  dificid fidaxomicin  for the treatment of cdad 
metronidazole  a generic product  is regularly prescribed to treat cdad at costs which are substantially lower than for vancocin 
products which are currently marketed for other indications by other companies may also be prescribed to treat this indication 
additionally  several other companies  including  merck co  sanofi aventis and cubist pharmaceuticals have clinical development programs with therapeutic agents for the treatment of c 
difficile infection that could be found to have competitive advantages over vancocin 
the fda approved cinryze for routine prophylaxis against angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with hereditary angioedema on october  cinryze became commercially available for routine prophylaxis against hae in december the commercial success of cinryze depends on several factors  including the number of patients with hae that may be treated with cinryze  manufacturing or supply interruptions and capacity which could impair our ability to acquire an adequate supply of cinryze to meet demand for the product  and our ability to achieve expansion of manufacturing capabilities in the capacities and timeframes currently anticipated  acceptance by physicians and patients of cinryze as a safe and effective treatment  our ability to effectively market and distribute cinryze in the united states  cost effectiveness of hae treatment using cinryze  relative convenience and ease of administration of cinryze  potential advantages of cinryze over alternative treatments  the timing of the approval of competitive products including another c esterase inhibitor for the acute treatment of hae  the market acceptance of competing approved products such as berinert  patients ability to obtain sufficient coverage or reimbursement by third party payors  variations in 
table of contents dosing arising from physician preferences and patient compliance  sufficient supply and reasonable pricing of raw materials necessary to manufacture cinryze 
in addition  our ability to develop life cycle management plans for cinryze  including designing and commencing clinical studies for additional indications and pursuing regulatory approvals in additional indications or territories will impact our ability to generate future revenues from cinryze 
in europe  the european commission has granted us centralized marketing authorization for cinryze in adults and adolescents with hae for routine prevention  pre procedure prevention and acute treatment of angioedema attacks 
the approval also includes a self administration option for appropriately trained patients 
in addition  the european commission has granted us a puma for buccolam 
we have begun the commercials sales of these products in europe during the fourth quarter of the commercial success of each of these products in europe will depend on a number of factors  including the impact of the loss of orphan designation on cinryze  market acceptance of each of the products and our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet patient needs 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of ppaca  as amended  is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the united states  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program 
several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  will affect us 
these include new requirements on private insurance companies that prohibit coverage denials because of a pre existing condition  prohibit the application of annual and lifetime benefits limits on health insurance policies  and prohibit coverage rescissions except for fraud and health based insurance rating 
in addition  ppaca  as amended  funds an interim high risk pool that states can draw on  following the expiration of this high risk pool funding  it provides for the creation of state run exchanges that will allow people without employer provided coverage  or who cannot afford their employer s plan  to buy health insurance  and provides federal subsidies to those who cannot afford premiums 
collectively  these factors may increase the availability of reimbursement for patients seeking the products that viropharma commercializes 
however  the act  as amended  will likely increase certain of our costs as well 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from to was effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march  in  ppaca also imposes a manufacturer s fee on the sale of branded pharmaceuticals excluding orphan drugs to specified government programs  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or doughnut hole 
we have determined that the manufacturing fee is immaterial relative to our anticipated operating income and cash flow 
we have also estimated that our incremental cost associated with the medicare part d coverage gap will be approximately million during our evaluation of ppaca  as amended  will continue to enable us to determine not only the immediate effects on our business  but also the trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation that may potentially impact on our business over time 
we will face intense competition in acquiring additional products to further expand our product portfolio 
many of the companies and institutions that we will compete with in acquiring additional products to further expand our product portfolio have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and greater resources to conduct business development activities 
we may need additional financing in order to acquire new products in connection with our plans as described in this report 
upon completion of business development transactions  we will face risks related to the integration of the acquired asset or business which could result in delays in development timelines  increased expenses or assumption of undisclosed liabilities  and disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with manufacturers  employees or other suppliers 
the outcome of our clinical development programs is subject to considerable uncertainties 
we are currently undertaking studies on the viability of subcutaneous administration of cinryze  either alone or in combination with halozyme s recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme rhuph technology  and to identify further therapeutic uses and potentially expand the labeled indication for cinryze to include other c mediated diseases  
table of contents such as amr and dgf 
in addition  we are also developing vp for the treatment and prevention of cdad and in may we initiated a phase dose ranging clinical study 
we anticipate that we will commence pre clinical and clinical studies with vp for the treatment of friedreich s ataxia 
there can be no assurance that that our clinical programs with cinryze  vp and vp will yield positive results or support further development 
there can be no assurance that the obs development efforts at maritage will yield positive results or support further development 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing and ultimately commercializing any of our product candidates  that the fda or other regulatory authorities will not require additional or unanticipated studies or clinical trial outcomes before granting regulatory approval  or that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates in the timeframes that we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments or cash flows from product sales will be sufficient to fund all of our ongoing development and operational costs  as well as the interest payable on our outstanding senior convertible notes  over the next several years  that planned clinical trials can be initiated  or that planned or ongoing clinical trials can be successfully concluded or concluded in accordance with our anticipated schedule and costs 
moreover  the results of our business development efforts could require considerable investments 
our actual results could differ materially from those results expressed in  or implied by  our expectations and assumption described in this annual report on form k 
the risks described in this report  our form k for the year ended december  are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results 
please also see our discussion of the risk factors in item a  which describe other important matters relating our business 
results of operations years ended december  and for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net product sales cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights operating income net income net income per share basic diluted the million in operating income for the twelve months ended december  increased million compared to the same period in the primary drivers of this increase are increased net sales of million 
partly offsetting the increased sales are an increase of million in cost of sales due to increased cinryze volume  an increase in research and development expense of million due to a million upfront fee and an additional million payment related to the achievement of a development milestone under our license arrangement with halozyme  a million upfront fee related to our license agreement with intellect neurosciences  inc ins  and  an increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily related to our european expansion efforts and our cinryze marketing programs 
additionally  we recorded the following in other operating expenses an impairment charge of approximately million related to certain assets acquired from auralis  a charge of approximately million related to the changes in the fair value of the auralis contingent consideration liability  and  a charge 
table of contents of approximately million of costs associated with the funding of cinryze manufacturing enhancements at sanquin 
we sell diamorphine in the uk  primarily to hospitals  through approved wholesalers 
we began commercial sales of cinryze and buccolam in europe during the fourth quarter of the revenues and operating income from these sales are not material to our consolidated revenues and operating income for or revenues revenues consisted of the following for the years ended december  in thousands net product sales vancocin cinryze other total revenues net product sales our sales of vancocin are influenced by wholesaler buying decisions related to their desired inventory levels and patient prescription demand  all of which could be at different levels from period to period 
in the us  we sell cinryze to specialty pharmacy specialty distributors sp sd s who then distribute to physicians  hospitals and patients  among others 
in europe  we sell cinryze to wholesalers who then distribute the product principally to pharmacies and hospitals 
we continue to work to expand our manufacturing capacity to ensure the availability of cinryze to meet growing patient needs and believe our efforts will allow us to continue to meet this growing patient demand for the foreseeable future 
in order to meet anticipated longer term demand  we submitted to the fda a prior approval supplement pas in the second quarter of the pas involves a larger scale manufacturing project to significantly increase the cinryze production capabilities at sanquin 
in october  the fda issued a complete response letter regarding the cinryze industrial scale manufacturing expansion activities 
in the complete response letter the fda has requested additional information related to observations from the pre approval inspection and review of the technical processes 
in february  the fda issued a second complete response letter which included three comments related to a portion of the cleaning validation for industrial scale manufacturing 
we believe that only one of the comments requires additional unplanned activity which can be completed in a relatively short time frame 
the fda also noted that it has not yet completed the review of our january updated responses to observations on form specific to the september inspection of the amsterdam facility 
in order to manufacture cinryze at the industrial scale we must respond to all fda questions and satisfactorily complete the fda review  including providing responses to all open observations on form during the year ended december   net sales of vancocin increased compared to the increase is primarily due to net realized price growth period over period 
the net increase in vancocin sales includes the negative impact on sales during of approximately million in sales deductions related to the medicare part d coverage gap discount enacted under ppaca which did not impact net sales in based upon data reported by ims health incorporated  prescriptions during the year ended december  decreased from the same period in by  which we believe is due to a decrease in the incidence of severe disease  improved aseptic technique and an increase in compounding  both in the hospital and long term care marketplace 
our net sales of cinryze during the year ended december  increased million 
table of contents compared to the same period in due to an increase in the number of patients receiving cinryze 
approximately million of the cinryze revenue increase was generated in the us 
vancocin product sales are driven by demand fluctuations in trade inventories which could be at different levels from period to period 
cinryze product sales are influenced by prescriptions and the rate at which new patients are placed on cinryze  as well as fluctuations in trade and patient inventory levels 
we receive inventory data from our three largest wholesalers through our fee for service agreements and our two sp sd s through service agreements 
we do not independently verify this data 
based on this inventory data and our estimates  we believe that as of december   the wholesalers and sp sd s did not have excess channel inventory of either product 
cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights cost of sales increased for the year ended december  by million as compared to the same period in primarily due to increased cinryze volume 
vancocin and cinryze cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs and excludes amortization of product rights 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts and clinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  stock compensation and other overhead costs 
due to advancements in our vp clinical program  our cinryze life cycle management program  the acquisition of duocort and the meritage development agreement  as well as cost associated with our efforts to advance additional initiatives intended to increase our cinryze capacity and the cost to develop vp and other compounds  we expect future costs in these programs to increase from historical levels 
research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs non toxigenic strains of c 
difficle vp cinryze c esterase inhibitor vancocin vp direct other assets cmv new initiatives other assets indirect development total direct expenses core development programs the increase in costs of vp for the year ended december  compared to the same period in relates to timing of costs associated with our phase clinical trial and the initiation of our phase clinical trial during the second quarter of 
table of contents our costs associated with our cinryze program increased during compared to as we incurred costs related to the continuation of our phase clinical trial and development of our life cycle program  including initiation of a phase study of subcutaneous administration of cinryze in combination with rhuph in the same period in the prior year  we incurred costs related to the preparation of our phase clinical trial 
during  we made a million upfront payment related to our entering into a license with halozyme for the development of a subcutaneous formulation of cinryze for routine prophylaxis against attacks of hae  and we made a million payment related to the achievement of a development milestone under our this license arrangement 
also during  we incurred a million upfront fee related to our license agreement with ins for the clinical stage drug candidate  vp  which is being developed for the treatment of friedreich s ataxia fa  a rare  hereditary  progressive neurodegenerative disease 
direct expenses other assets our direct expenses related to our cmv program decreased in compared to as we wound down our stem cell and liver transplant studies during during  we continue to evaluate potential alternative development strategies for maribavir 
our costs related to new initiatives represent expenses associated with our evaluation of a recombinant c inh technology and spending under our collaboration agreement with sanquin supporting their early stage research programs 
anticipated fluctuations in future direct expenses are discussed under liquidity development programs 
indirect expenses these costs primarily relate to the compensation of and overhead attributable to our development team 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a in compared to  sg a increased million 
this increase was primarily driven by higher compensation expense and employee cost of million  increased marketing expenses of million and increased corporate cost of million 
our european infrastructure and commercialization efforts and new cinryze marketing programs in the us are predominant reasons for the overall increase in sg a in both periods 
we anticipate that our sg a spending will continue to increase in future periods as we continue our commercialization and expansion efforts outside the united states 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the year over year increases are primarily due to the amortization of the auralis intangible assets acquired in may of impairment losses due to the approval and launch of buccolam  coupled with the launch of cinryze in europe  we have decided to alter our development and commercialization plans for the remaining auralis ipr d asset 
the decision resulted in the impairment of the ipr d asset and the auralis contract rights 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of approximately million approximately million during 
table of contents other operating expenses the re measurement of the fair value of the contingent consideration given for the acquisition of auralis resulted in a charge to income of approximately million during we incurred expense of approximately million for the re measurement of the fair value of the contingent consideration during also included in other operating expenses for is approximately million of costs associated with the funding of cinryze manufacturing enhancements at sanquin

income tax expense our income tax expense was million and million for and  respectively 
our income tax expense includes federal  state and foreign income taxes at statutory rates and the effects of various permanent differences 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate in is lower than the statutory us tax rate due to domestic manufacturing tax deductions and a reduction in the valuation allowance for state net operating losses partly offset by state income taxes  and by certain share based compensation and an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration  neither of which is deductible for tax purposes 
our effective tax rate in was higher than the statutory us tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and certain share based compensation that is not tax deductible 
the examination of our us income tax return concluded during the quarter ended march  with no material adjustments 
we are currently under examination in a foreign jurisdiction and by various states 
at this time  we do not believe that the results of these examinations will have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net product sales cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights operating income net loss income net loss income per share basic diluted the million in operating income for the twelve months ended december  increased million as compared to the same period in the primary drivers of this increase are increased net sales of million  the million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of for which no impairment occurred in  and  a decrease in our research and development expense of million primarily due to the wind down of our cmv program 
these were partly offset from increased cost of sales million due to the increase in cinryze sales volume and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
revenues revenues consisted of the following for the years ended december  in thousands net product sales vancocin cinryze other total revenues revenue vancocin and cinryze product sales during the year ended december   net sales of vancocin increased compared to the increase is primarily due to price increases during  offset by lower sales volumes 
based upon data reported by ims health incorporated  prescriptions during the year ended december  decreased from the same period in by  which we believe is due to a decrease in the severity of the disease state  improved aseptic techniques and a suspected increase in compounding seen both in the hospital and long term care marketplace 
the units sold for the year ended december  decreased by compared to the same period in our net sales of cinryze during the year ended december  increased million compared to the same period in due to an increase in the number of patients receiving cinryze 
vancocin product sales are driven by demand fluctuations in trade inventories which could be at different levels from period to period 
cinryze product sales are influenced by prescriptions and the rate at which new patients are placed on cinryze 
we receive inventory data from our three largest wholesalers through our fee for service agreements and our two sp sd s through service agreements

based on this inventory data and our estimates  we believe that as of december   the wholesalers and sp sd s did not have excess channel inventory of either product 

table of contents cost of sales excluding amortization of product rights cost of sales increased for the year ended december  by million as compared to the same period in due to increased cinryze volume  partially offset by the impact of the step up on cost of sales related to the acquisition of lev million 
we utilized the entire inventory that was recorded at fair value as part of the lev purchase during additionally  included in the cost of sales for the year ended december  are expenses of million related to non refundable start up costs paid to a new plasma supplier and a million write off of inventory  produced as part of our effort to receive fda approval for a larger scale manufacturing line 
vancocin and cinryze cost of sales includes the cost of materials and distribution costs and excludes amortization of product rights 
since units are shipped based upon earliest expiration date  we would expect the cost of product sales of both vancocin and cinryze to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we may experience fluctuations in quarterly manufacturing yields 
research and development expenses for each of our research and development programs  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include third party costs related to these programs such as contract research  consulting  cost sharing payments or receipts and clinical and development costs 
indirect expenses include personnel  facility  stock compensation and other overhead costs 
due to advancements in our vp preclinical program  and our cinryze phase commitment and phase study in children  we expect future costs in these programs to exceed historical costs 
research and development expenses were divided between our research and development programs in the following manner for the years ended december  in thousands direct core programs non toxigenic strains of c

table of contents vancocin costs in and related to additional research activities 
direct expenses other assets our direct expenses related to our cmv program decreased in compared to as we wound down our stem cell and liver transplant studies in in february  based upon preliminary analysis of the data  we announced that our phase trial evaluating maribavir used as prophylaxis in allogeneic stem cell  or bone marrow  transplant patients did not achieve its primary endpoints 
in addition  the study failed to meet its key secondary endpoints 
additionally  we announced that our phase trial evaluating maribavir in liver transplant patients was discontinued and that all patients on study drug were moved to current standard of care 
during we continued enrollment in our solid organ liver study through february  conducted follow up visits necessary to complete both our phase studies following receipt of the results of our stem cell transplant study and continued to evaluate the results of our phase programs 
we continue to evaluate any potential alternative development strategies for maribavir 
our costs related to new initiatives represent expenses associated with our evaluation of a recombinant c inh technology and spending under our collaboration agreement with sanquin supporting their early stage research programs 
included in the other assets is a one time charge of approximately million associated with a re negotiation of a royalty arrangement on a product in late stage development 
anticipated fluctuations in future direct expenses are discussed under liquidity development programs 
indirect expenses these costs primarily relate to the compensation of and overhead attributable to our development team 
during the second half of and through  our development team shifted its focus from our cmv program to our cinryze and vp programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million during compared to the increase was driven by increased marketing expenses million  legal costs million  compensation expense million and increased costs associated with our activities in europe  partly offset by decreased medical education expenses million 
included in sg a are legal and consulting costs incurred related to our opposition to the attempt by the ogd regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a generic drug application to request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing for copies of vancocin  which were million and million for the years and  respectively 
we anticipate that these additional legal and consulting costs will continue at the current level  or possibly higher  in future periods as we continue this opposition 
we anticipate continued increased spending in selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods as we continue to implement additional commercial programs related to cinryze and continue our european initiatives 
intangible amortization and acquisition of technology rights intangible amortization for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of our intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
this evaluation did not result in a change in the life of the intangible assets during the year ended december  we will continue to monitor the actions of the fda and ogd surrounding the bioequivalence recommendation for vancocin and consider the 
table of contents effects of our opposition efforts  any announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators 
we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets  as well as estimated useful lives  at such time 
impairment losses during the first quarter of  the market capitalization of viropharma fell below the carrying value of viropharma s net assets due to the announcements surrounding our maribavir development program 
this situation required us to test for impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets which lead to a goodwill impairment charge of million in there was no impairment of goodwill during during we incurred an impairment charge related to our previous corporate headquarters of million due to the down turn in the real estate market 
other operating expenses the re measurement of the fair value of the contingent consideration given relating to the acquisition of auralis resulted in a charge to income during the period ended december  of million 
there was no such charge during other income expense interest income interest income for year ended december  was million is flat compared to million in interest expense for the years ended december  in thousands interest expense on senior convertible notes amortization of debt discount amortization of finance costs total interest expense interest expense and amortization of debt discount and finance costs in and relates entirely to the senior convertible notes issued on march  other income  net our other income  net includes net foreign exchange gains and the rental income attributable to our previous corporate headquarters 
income tax expense our income tax expense was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was compared to in the effective tax rate in exceeded the federal statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and certain share based compensation that is not tax deductible 
the effective tax rate in exceeded the statutory tax rate because of a goodwill impairment charge which is not deductible for tax purposes and state income taxes  partially offset by an orphan drug credit 

table of contents liquidity in the near term  we expect that our sources of revenue will continue to arise from cinryze and vancocin product sales 
we began the commercial sales of buccolam and cinryze in europe during the fourth quarter of however  future sales of vancocin will vary based on the number of generic competitors that could enter the market if the three year exclusivity period is not granted by the fda as a result of the fda s approval of a supplemental new drug application snda for vancocin or if fda decides that any protected labeling can be omitted from the labels of generic products  and if generics are permitted to demonstrate bioequivalence through an in vitro dissolution method  the timing of entry into the market of those generic competitors and or the sales we may generate from an authorized generic version of vancocin 
in addition  there are no assurances that demand for cinryze will continue to grow or that demand for vancocin will continue at historical or current levels 
although we began commercial sales of cinryze and buccolam in europe during the fourth quarter of  the revenues and operating income from these sales are not material to our consolidated revenues and operating income for and there are no assurances that there will be growing demand for products in europe or we will be successful in our commercialization efforts in europe or any other territories we have the rights to sell these drug products 
our ability to generate positive cash flow is also impacted by the timing of anticipated events in our cinryze  vp  vp  plenadren and other development programs  including the timing of our expansions into other territories and the costs of our anticipated commercial activities  the scope of the clinical trials required by regulatory authorities  results from clinical trials  the results of our product development efforts  including the obs development efforts at meritage and variations from our estimate of future direct and indirect expenses 
the cash flows we have used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities  marketing and commercial efforts  business development activities  general and administrative expenses  debt service  and income tax payments 
bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase  phase  and phase clinical trials and fda and or ema or regulatory approval is a time consuming and expensive process 
because we have product candidates that are currently in the clinical stage of development  there are a variety of events that could occur during the development process that will dictate the course we must take with our drug development efforts and the cost of these efforts 
as a result  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs that we will incur through the commercialization of any product candidate 
however  our future costs may exceed current costs as we anticipate we will continue to invest in our pipeline  including our initiative to develop vp non toxigenic strains of c 
difficile  vp  any additional studies to identify further therapeutic uses and expand the labeled indication for cinryze to potentially include other c mediated diseases as well as new modes of administration for cinryze 
also  we will incur additional costs as we intend to seek to commercialize cinryze  buccolam and plenadren in europe in countries where we have distribution rights and certain other countries beginning in as well as conduct studies to identify additional c mediated diseases  such as amr and dgf  which may be of interest for further clinical development  and to evaluate new forms of administration for cinryze 
in may  halozyme therapeutics halozyme granted us an exclusive worldwide license to use halozyme s proprietary enhanze technology  a proprietary drug delivery platform using halozyme s recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme rhuph technology in combination with a c esterase inhibitor 
we intend to apply rhuph initially to develop a novel subcutaneous formulation of cinryze for routine prophylaxis against attacks 
under the terms of the license agreement  we paid halozyme an initial upfront payment of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a milestone payment of million related to the initiation of a phase study begun in september to evaluate the safety  and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneous administration of cinryze in combination with rhuph pending successful completion of an additional series of clinical and regulatory milestones  anticipated to begin during  we may make further milestone payments to halozyme which could reach up to an additional million related to hae and up to million of 
table of contents additional milestone payments for three additional indications 
additionally  we will pay an annual maintenance fee of million to halozyme until specified events have occurred 
upon regulatory approval  halozyme will receive up to a royalty on net sales of the combination product utilizing cinryze and rhuph  depending on the existence of a valid patent claim in the country of sale 
on september   we entered into a license agreement for the worldwide rights of intellect neurosciences  inc ins to its clinical stage drug candidate  vp  being developed for the treatment of friedreich s ataxia fa  a rare  hereditary  progressive neurodegenerative disease 
we expect to initiate a phase study within to months of the date of this agreement  after completion of longer term toxicology studies 
we intend to file for orphan drug designation upon review of the phase proof of concept data 
under the terms of the agreement  we have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize vp for the treatment  management or prevention of any disease or condition covered by intellect s patents 
we paid ins a million up front licensing fee and may pay additional milestones up to million based upon defined events 
we will also pay a tiered royalty of up to a maximum percentage of low teens  based on annual net sales 
on october   we completed our acquisition under which viropharma acquired lev pharmaceuticals  inc lev 
lev is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
the terms of the merger agreement provided for the conversion of each share of lev common stock into upfront consideration of million  or per lev share  comprised of per share in cash and per share in viropharma common stock  and contingent consideration of up to per share which may be paid on achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones 
the target for the first cvr payment of per share or million will not be paid as a third party s human c inhibitor product was approved for the acute treatment of hae and granted orphan exclusivity 
the second cvr payment of per share million becomes payable if cinryze reaches at least million in cumulative net product sales by october as of december   we have recognized approximately million of cumulative sales of cinryze and we anticipate achieving this milestone in on november   we acquired a ownership interest in duocort pharma ab duocort  a private company based in helsingborg  sweden focused on improving glucocorticoid replacement therapy for treatment of adrenal insufficiency  or addison s disease ad 
we paid approximately million swedish krona sek or approximately million in upfront consideration 
we have also agreed to make additional payments ranging from sek million up to sek million or approximately million to million  contingent on the achievement of certain milestones 
up to sek million or approximately million of the contingent payments relate to specific regulatory milestones  and up to sek million or approximately million of the contingent payments are related to commercial milestones based on the success of the product 
on december   we entered into an exclusive development and option agreement with meritage pharma  inc meritage  a private company based in san diego  ca focused on developing oral budesonide suspension obs as a treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis eoe 
as consideration for the agreement  we paid an initial million and have the option to provide meritage up to an additional million for the development of obs 
meritage will utilize the funding to conduct additional phase clinical assessment of obs 
we have an exclusive option to acquire meritage  at our sole discretion  by providing written notice at any time during the period from december  to and including the date that is the earlier of a the date that is business days after the later of i the receipt of the final study data for the phase study and ii identification of an acceptable clinical end point definition for a pivotal induction study agreed to by the fda 
if we exercise this option  we have agreed to pay million for all of the outstanding capital stock of meritage 
meritage stockholders could also receive additional payments of up to million  upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
the most significant of our near term operating development cash outflows are as described under development programs as set forth below 

table of contents in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca 
the ppaca  as amended  will likely increase certain of our costs as well 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from to was effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march  beginning in  the ppaca also imposes a manufacturer s fee on the sale of branded pharmaceuticals excluding orphan drugs to specified government programs  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or donut hole 
we have determined that the manufacturing fee is immaterial relative to our anticipated operating income and cash flow 
we have also estimated that our incremental cost associated with the medicare part d coverage gap will be approximately million during our evaluation of ppaca  as amended  will continue to enable us to determine not only the immediate effects on our business  but also the trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation that may potentially impact on our business over time 
capital resources while we anticipate that cash flows from cinryze and vancocin  our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together  our cash and revolving credit facility should allow us to fund our ongoing development and operating costs  as well our interest payments and future milestone payments or acquisition costs  we may need additional financing in order to expand our product portfolio 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
short term investments consist of high quality fixed income securities with remaining maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchase and high quality debt securities or obligation of departments or agencies of the united states 
at december   the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate on our short term investments was and the weighted average length to maturity was months 
at december   we also had million available under our revolving credit agreement 
at december   approximately million of our cash and availability under the credit agreement is subject to the minimum liquidity covenant  as defined in our credit agreement 
financing should we need financing  we would seek to access the public or private equity or debt markets  enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue equity or debt securities or enter into other alternative financing arrangements that may become available to us 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may significantly dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
if we raise additional capital by accessing debt markets  the terms and pricing for these financings may be much more favorable to the new lenders than the terms obtained from our prior lenders 
these financings also may require liens on certain of our assets that may limit our flexibility 
additional equity or debt financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our operating results  our inability to achieve regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce patent claims and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
from time to time  we may seek approval from our board of directors to evaluate additional opportunities to repurchase our common stock or convertible notes  including through open market purchases or individually negotiated transactions 

table of contents overall cash flows during the twelve months ended december   we generated million of net cash from operating activities  primarily from our net income after adjustments for non cash items  including the charge for the intangible assets impairment  partly offset by our net increase in working capital and our payment of the auralis contingent consideration

share repurchase program on march  our board of directors authorized the use of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock and or our senior convertible notes due purchases may be made by means of open market transactions  block transactions  privately negotiated purchase transactions or other techniques from time to time 
the sources of cash for this repurchase program were a combination of our available liquid assets and or our cash flows from operations 
on march   we entered into a three month accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a large financial institution to repurchase million of our common stock on an accelerated basis 
we paid million to the financial institution and received approximately million shares under this arrangement at an average purchase price of per share 
during the third quarter of  we reacquired approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million or an average price of per share 
these purchases effectively completed our repurchase program authorized by our board on march  on september   our board of directors authorized the use of up to an additional million to repurchase shares of our common stock and or our senior convertible notes due purchases may be made by means of open market transactions  block transactions  privately negotiated purchase transactions or other techniques from time to time 
to the extent repurchases are made  the sources of cash for this program are expected to be a combination of our available liquid assets and or cash flows from operations

from time to time  we may seek approval from our board of directors to evaluate additional opportunities to repurchase our common stock or convertible notes  including through open market purchases or individually negotiated transactions 
senior convertible notes on march   we issued million of senior convertible notes due march the senior convertible notes in a public offering 
net proceeds from the issuance of the senior convertible notes were million 
the senior convertible notes are unsecured unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with any other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year commencing on september  the debt and equity components of our senior convertible debt securities are bifurcated and accounted for separately based on the value and related interest rate of a non convertible debt security with the same terms 
the fair value of a non convertible debt instrument at the original issuance date was determined to be million 
the equity conversion options component of our convertible debt securities is included in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet and  accordingly  the initial carrying value of the debt securities was reduced by million 
our net income for financial reporting purposes is reduced by recognizing the accretion of the reduced carrying values of our convertible debt securities to their face amount of million as additional non cash interest expense 
accordingly  the senior convertible debt securities will recognize interest expense at effective rates of as they are accreted to par value 

table of contents as of december  senior convertible notes representing million of principal debt are outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of approximately million  based on the level valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurements standard 
the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the senior convertible notes may only be converted i anytime after december   ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  iii during any calendar quarter and only during such quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
upon conversion  holders of the senior convertible notes will receive shares of common stock  subject to viropharma s option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes  and shares for any excess 
we can irrevocably elect this option at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes may be required to be repaid on the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  as defined in the senior convertible notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the senior convertible notes  we entered into privately negotiated transactions  comprised of purchased call options and warrants sold  to reduce the potential dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the senior convertible notes 
the transactions  taken together  have the effect of increasing the initial conversion price to per share 
the net cost of the transactions was million 
the call options allowed viropharma to receive up to approximately million shares of its common stock at per share from the call option holders  equal to the number of shares of common stock that viropharma would issue to the holders of the senior convertible notes upon conversion 
these call options will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity dates of the related senior convertible notes or the first day all of the related senior convertible notes are no longer outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
concurrently  we sold warrants to the warrant holders to receive shares of its common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants expire ratably over a day trading period beginning on june  and will be net share settled 
the purchased call options are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the senior convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of viropharma common stock at the time of exercise is greater than  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the senior convertible notes  but less than the warrant exercise price 
the warrant exercise price is higher than the price per share of of our common stock on the pricing date 
if the market price per share of viropharma common stock at the time of conversion of any senior convertible notes is above the strike price of the purchased call options  the purchased call options will entitle us to receive from the counterparties in the aggregate the same number of shares of our common stock as we would be required to issue to the holder of the converted senior convertible notes 
additionally  if the market price of viropharma common stock at the time of exercise of the sold warrants exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants  we will owe the counterparties an aggregate of approximately million shares of viropharma common stock 
if we have insufficient shares of common stock available for settlement of the warrants  we may issue shares of a newly created series of preferred stock in lieu of our obligation to deliver common stock 
any such preferred stock would be convertible into more shares of our common stock than the amount of common stock we would otherwise have been obligated to deliver under the warrants 
initially  the purchased call options and warrants sold with the terms described above were based upon the million offering  and the number of shares we would purchase under the call option and the number of shares we would sell under the warrants was  to correlate to the million principal amount 
on march  
table of contents we repurchased  in a privately negotiated transaction  million in principal amount of our senior convertible notes due march for total consideration of approximately million 
the repurchase represented of our then outstanding debt and was executed at a price equal to of par value 
additionally  in negotiated transactions  we sold approximately million call options for approximately million and repurchased approximately million warrants for approximately million which terminated the call options and warrants that were previously entered into by us in march we recognized a million gain in the first quarter of as a result of this debt extinguishment 
for tax purposes  the gain qualifies for deferral until in accordance with the provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act 
as a result of the above negotiated sale and purchase transactions we are now entitled to receive approximately million shares of our common stock at from the call option holders and if the market price of viropharma common stock at the time of exercise of the sold warrants exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants  will owe the counterparties an aggregate of approximately million shares of viropharma common stock  which correlates to million of convertible notes outstanding 
the purchased call options and sold warrants are separate transactions entered into by us with the counterparties  are not part of the terms of the senior convertible notes  and will not affect the holders rights under the senior convertible notes 
holders of the senior convertible notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased call options or the sold warrants 
the purchased call options and sold warrants meet the definition of derivatives 
these instruments have been determined to be indexed to our own stock and have been recorded in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
as long as the instruments are classified in stockholders equity they are not subject to the mark to market provisions

these payments represent interest and principal related to our senior convertible notes due march pursuant to the terms of the row agreement  sanquin may conduct certain early stage research programs for which we will provide to sanquin  approximately million per year for a period of five years 
we have committed to purchase up to  liters of plasma in and up to  liters of plasma per year in through from our suppliers 
additionally  we are required to purchase a minimum number of units from our third party toll manufacturer 
excluded from these amounts is the manufacturing fee for cinryze produced under the eu and row agreement as the minimum purchase shall be determined by the joint steering committee in off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we consider the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements and that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows product sales our net sales consist of revenue from sales of our products  vancocin  cinryze  buccolam and diamorphine  less estimates for chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  returns and losses 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer  when estimated provisions for chargebacks  rebates  distribution service fees  returns and losses are reasonably determinable  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until estimates can be made for chargebacks  rebates and losses and all of the above conditions are met and when the product has achieved market acceptance  which is typically based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained during the period following launch 
at the end of each reporting period we analyze our estimated channel inventory and we would defer recognition of revenue on product that has been delivered if we believe that channel inventory at a period end is in excess of ordinary business needs 
further  if we believe channel inventory levels are increasing without a reasonably correlating increase in prescription demand  we proactively delay the processing of wholesaler orders until these levels are reduced 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates  sales discounts and product returns 
these accruals are primarily based upon the history of vancocin and for cinryze they are based on information on payee s obtained from our sp sd s and cinryzesolutions 
we also consider the volume and price of our products in the channel  trends in wholesaler inventory  conditions that might impact patient demand for our product such as incidence of disease and the threat of generics and other factors 
in addition to internal information  such as unit sales  we use information from external resources  which we do not verify  to estimate the vancocin channel inventory 
our external resources include prescription data reported by ims health incorporated and written and verbal information obtained from our three largest wholesaler customers with respect to their inventory levels 
based upon this information  we believe that inventory held at these warehouses are within normal levels 
chargebacks and rebates are the most subjective sales related accruals 
while we currently have no contracts with private third party payors  such as hmo s  we do have contractual arrangements with governmental agencies  including medicaid 
we establish accruals for chargebacks and rebates related to these contracts in the period in which we record the sale as revenue 
these accruals are based upon historical experience of government agencies market share  governmental contractual prices  our current pricing and then current laws  regulations and interpretations 
we analyze the accrual at least quarterly and adjust the balance as needed 
these analyses have been adjusted to reflect the us healthcare reform acts and their affect on governmental contractual prices and rebates 
we believe that a change in our estimate of the actual rate of sales subject to governmental rebates would affect our operating income and accruals by approximately million in the period of adjustment 
annually  as part of our process  we performed an analysis on the share of vancocin and cinryze sales that ultimately go to medicaid recipients and result in a medicaid rebate 
as part of that analysis  we considered our actual medicaid historical rebates processed  total units sold and fluctuations in channel inventory 
we also consider our payee mix for cinryze based on information obtained at the time of prescription 
under the ppaca we are required to fund of the medicare part d insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients staring on january  for vancocin sales subject to this discount we recognize this cost using an effective rebate percentage for all sales to medicare patients throughout the year 
for applicable cinryze sales we recognize this cost at the time of sale for 
table of contents product expected to be purchased by a medicare part d insured patient when we estimate they are within the coverage gap 
product return accruals are estimated based on vancocin s history of damage and product expiration returns and are recorded in the period in which we record the sale of revenue 
cinryze has a no returns policy 
impairment of long lived assets we test our long lived fixed and intangible assets for recoverability whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the impairment test is a two step test 
under step one we assess the recoverability of an asset or asset group 
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss is measured in step two as the difference between the carrying value of the asset or asset group and its fair value 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
such assumptions include  for example  projections of future cash flows and the timing and number of generic competitive entries into the market  in determining the undiscounted cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of the asset and whether impairment exists 
these assumptions are subjective and could result in a material impact on operating results in the period of impairment 
on an ongoing periodic basis  we evaluate the useful life of intangible assets and determine if any economic  governmental or regulatory event has modified their estimated useful lives 
on august  the fda s pharmaceutical science and clinical pharmacology advisory committee voted in favor of the component of the ogd s draft guidelines on bioequivalence for vancocin that permits bioequivalence to be demonstrated through comparable in vitro dissolution for potential vancomycin hcl capsule generic products that contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same amounts as vancocin  among other requirements 
if fda s proposed bioequivalence method for vancocin becomes effective  the time period in which a generic competitor could be approved would be reduced and multiple generics may enter the market  which would materially impact our operating results  cash flows and possibly intangible asset valuations 
this could also result in a reduction to the useful life of the vancocin related intangible assets 
management currently believes there are no indicators that would require a change in useful life as management believes that vancocin will continue to be utilized along with generics that may enter the market  and the number of generics and the timing of their market entry is unknown 
a reduction in the useful life  as well as the timing and number of generics  will impact our cash flow assumptions and estimate of fair value  perhaps to a level that could result in an impairment charge 
we will continue to monitor the actions of the ogd and consider the effects of our opposition actions and any announcements by generic competitors or other adverse events for additional impairment indicators 
we will reevaluate the expected cash flows and fair value of our vancocin related assets at such time a triggering event occurs 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  to determine whether impairment may exist 
the goodwill impairment test consists of two steps 
the first step compares a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying amount to identify potential goodwill impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the second step of the impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
step two requires an assignment of the reporting unit s fair value to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to determine the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized  if any 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets is a one step test  which compares the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value 
if 
table of contents the carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
based on accounting standards  it is required that these assets be assessed at least annually for impairment unless a triggering event occurs between annual assessments which would then require an assessment in the period which a triggering event occurred 
share based payments we record the estimated grant date fair value of awards granted as stock based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on pre tax earnings  enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates  determination of manufacturing income and related deduction limits  limitations on the use of tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards  evaluation of qualified expenses related to the orphan drug credit and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to projections of future taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax examinations 
as part of this evaluation  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which the related temporary difference becomes deductible or the nol and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
with respect to the reversal of valuation allowances  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the existence and nature of reversing deferred tax liabilities  the utilization of carryforwards and other factors 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
we recognize the benefit of tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if such tax position is more likely than not of being sustained 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact our income tax expense in the year of resolution 
acquisition accounting the application of the purchase accounting requires certain estimates and assumptions especially concerning the determination of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets and property  plant and equipment as well as the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition 
moreover  the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets  property  plant and equipment have to be determined 
the total purchase price of businesses acquired will be allocated to the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and the fair value of any contingent consideration 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be expensed in the period in which the change in fair value occurs 
additionally  acquired ipr d projects will initially be capitalized and considered indefinite lived assets subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events 
for those compounds that reach commercialization  the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives 
measurement of fair value and useful lives are based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows 
if actual cash flows vary from those used in calculating fair values  this may significantly affect our future results of operations 
in particular  the estimation of discounted cash flows of intangible assets of newly developed products is subject to assumptions closely related to the nature of the acquired products 
factors that may affect the assumptions regarding future cash flows long term sales forecasts  anticipation of selling price erosion after the end of orphan exclusivity due to follow on biologic competition in the market  behavior of competitors launch of competing products  marketing initiatives etc 
table of contents for significant acquisitions  the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent third party valuation specialists 
the valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date 
as our business evolves  we may face additional issues that will require increased levels of management estimation and complex judgments 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu amends certain disclosure requirements of topic to provide for additional disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and and for activity in level the asu also clarifies certain other disclosure requirements including level of disaggregation and disclosures around inputs and valuation techniques 
we adopted this asu on january  the new disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and we adopted this provision on january  the adoption of this disclosure provision did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  formerly eitf issue no 
asu  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb asc topic and provides accounting principles and application guidance on how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance changes how to determine the fair value of undelivered products and services for separate revenue recognition 
allocation of consideration is now based on management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item where there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this asu january  the adoption of the provisions of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in march  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition  and as a result of this ratification the fasb issued asu in april  which states that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model for revenue recognition if the milestones are substantive and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the milestones will be achieved 
the task force agreed that whether a milestone is substantive is a judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  we adopted this asu january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu  fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufactures eitf issue d  asc  which addresses how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in the income statement fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care education reconciliation act 
the asu specifies that the liability for the fee be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year 
the new guidance is effective for calendar years beginning after december  we adopted this asu january  the adoption of this guidance does not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  and the iasb issued ifrs  fair value measurement 
the new guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and ifrs 
the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
we do not expect the amendment to us gaap to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income topic 
this standard eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the standard is intended to enhance comparability between entities that report under us gaap and those that report under ifrs  and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
under the asu  an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
each component of net income and each component of other comprehensive income  together with totals for comprehensive income and its two parts  net income and other comprehensive income  would need to be displayed under either alternative 
the statement s would need to be presented with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements 
this asu does not change items that constitute net income and other comprehensive income  when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income or the earnings per share computation which will continue to be based on net income 
the new us gaap requirements are effective for public entities as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after december  and interim and annual periods thereafter 
early adoption is permitted  but full retrospective application is required under the accounting standard 
we do not expect the amendment to us gaap to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update this asu defers certain provisions of asu  which required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual periods 
this requirement is indefinitely deferred by this asu and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
the new asu is effective for public entities as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after december  and interim and annual periods thereafter  the same as that for the unaffected provisions of asu we do not expect the amendments in this asu to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard topic 
the objective of this update is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update provide the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
these include macro economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity s operating environment  entity specific events such as declining financial performance  and other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold 
an entity should also consider in its qualitative assessment the cushion between a reporting unit s fair value and carrying amount if determined in a recent fair value calculation 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  if a company has not yet issued financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are primarily comprised of money market funds holding only us government securities and fixed income securities  including a mix of corporate debt and government securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
our primary investment objective is the preservation of principal  while at the same time optimizing the generation of investment income 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in cash equivalents such as treasury bills and money market funds and fixed income securities such as us government and agency securities  municipal securities  taxable municipals  and corporate notes while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we generally invest in financial instruments with maturities of less than one year 
the carrying amount  which approximates fair value based on the level valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurement standard  and the annualized weighted average nominal interest rate of our investment portfolio at december   was approximately million and  respectively 
the weighted average length to maturity was months 
a one percent change in the interest rate would have resulted in a million impact to interest income for the quarter ended december  at december   we had principal outstanding of million of our senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year commencing on september  the senior convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the senior convertible notes may only be converted i anytime after december   ii during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each trading day of that measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  iii during any calendar quarter and only during such quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or iv upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
upon conversion  holders of the senior convertible notes will receive shares of common stock  subject to our option to irrevocably elect to settle all future conversions in cash up to the principal amount of the senior convertible notes  and shares for any excess 
we can irrevocably elect this option at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the senior convertible notes 
the senior convertible notes may be required to be repaid on the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  as defined in the senior convertible notes 
as of december   the fair value of the principal of the million convertible senior notes outstanding was approximately million  based on the level valuation hierarchy of the fair value measurements standard 
the carrying value of the debt at december  is million 
in connection with the issuance of the senior convertible senior notes  we have entered into privately negotiated transactions with two counterparties the counterparties  comprised of purchased call options and warrants sold 
these transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential equity dilution of our common stock upon conversion of the senior convertible notes 
these transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards  and diversification of counterparties 
additionally  if we were to utilize amounts under our revolving credit facility  we could be exposed to interest rate risk
