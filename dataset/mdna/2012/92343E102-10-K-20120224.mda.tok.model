overview we are a provider of internet infrastructure services 
by leveraging our global infrastructure  we provide network confidence and availability for mission critical internet services  such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services 
our service capabilities enable domain name registration through registrars and provide network availability for registrars and internet users alike 
our business consists of one reportable segment  naming services  which consists of registry services and network intelligence and availability nia services 
registry services operates the authoritative directory of all 
com  
net  
cc  
tv  and 
name domain names and the back end systems for all 
gov  
jobs and 
edu domain names 
as of december   we had approximately million domain names registered under the 
com and 
net registries  our principal registries 
the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising  e commerce  and the number of internet users  which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband  as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third party registrars 
although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in the us  growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us over the long term 
nia services provides infrastructure assurance services to organizations and is comprised of verisign idefense security intelligence services  managed domain name system services  and distributed denial of service protection services 
revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenue 
business highlights and trends we recorded revenues of million  an increase of as compared to the increase was primarily due to an year over year increase in active domain names ending in 
com and 
net and increases in our 
com and 
net registry fees in july we recorded operating income of million  an increase of as compared to  primarily due to an increase in revenues and as well as a reduction in general and administrative expenses as we completed the restructuring plan 
in april  we declared and in may paid a special dividend of per share of our common stock totaling million 
as a result of the dividend  we also paid million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debentures 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million in under the share buyback program 
in  we sold million of marketable securities  primarily to fund the may special dividend 

table of contents we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  an increase of as compared to the increase was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees as well as greater income taxes payable in as a result of the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business  before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units rsus 
the increase was partially offset by the elimination of cash flows from the divested authentication services business 
we renewed our agreement with icann to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the 
net registry for another six years  effective july  in november  we purchased our new corporate headquarters building in reston  virginia for million 
in november  we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility and borrowed million under this facility in part to finance the purchase of the reston building 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time 
fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs 
the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
however  at times  we enter into non standard arrangements including multiple element arrangements 
as a result  we must evaluate whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
fair value of financial instruments our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative 
the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value  and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize a valuation model based on stock price  bond price  risk adjusted interest rates  volatility  and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative 
several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 
litigation and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies are based on management s judgment as to the potential amount of loss incurred 
a liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents these liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment 
if actual results differ from these estimates  our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal  state  and international tax audits 
we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon 
we consider the following matters  among others  in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts  budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term  the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest  and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances 
if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings  the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
earnings per share we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share 
under this method  only a positive conversion spread related to the convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations 
this is based on management s intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the debt in cash 
a change in management s intent and ability would require us to use the if converted method  which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share

changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations  in each case as impacted by continued internet growth  promotional marketing programs  marketing expenditure by third party registrars  as well as fee increases as permitted under our agreements with icann 
on july   we increased our

net domain name registrations by up to each year during the term of our renewed agreement with icann through june  we offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate

mature markets such as the us  where broadband and e commerce have seen strong market penetration  are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets 
we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions  resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding e commerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and market risks 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
the impact of a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our interest expense in our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk 
as of december  we had million of fixed income securities  which consisted primarily of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies 
the impact of a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 
foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with both monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts  which are usually placed and adjusted monthly 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 
as of december   we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 
market risk management the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as 
table of contents interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately billion  based on quoted market prices 
the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk 
generally  the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures
