these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of care in heart recovery to heart failure patients 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab  by interventional cardiologists and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically or emergently before  during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures 
we believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for patients experiencing heart failure because it restores their quality of life 
in addition  we believe that for the care of such patients  heart recovery is the most cost effective solution for the healthcare system 
our strategic focus and the driver of the most recent revenue growth in our business is the market penetration of our impella product  which received k clearance in june for partial circulatory support for up to six hours 
we received k clearance in april for our impella and impella ld devices for circulatory support for up to hours 
these devices are larger and provide more blood flow than the impella in december  we announced a new higher flow impella device  named impella cvad 
the impella cvad is implanted via the femoral artery and provides peak flow of approximately four liters of blood per minute 
we received ce mark approval in april we will launch the impella cvad commercially in europe in early fiscal this product is not currently approved by the fda for sale in the us we expect the impella cvad to receive k clearance and be commercially available in the us in the second half of fiscal in addition  we are currently conducting initial patient use trials outside of the us of the impella rp 
the impella rp is a percutaneous catheter based axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of flow and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right heart failure 
this product is not currently available for sale in the us revenues from our other heart recovery products  largely focused on the heart surgery suite  have been lower recently as we have strategically shifted our sales and marketing efforts towards our impella products and the cath lab 
we expect revenues during fiscal from our non impella business  including bvs and ab  will continue to decrease as we continue to focus on our impella products 
in november  we announced symphony  a synchronized minimally invasive implantable cardiac assist device designed to treat chronic patients with moderate heart failure by improving patient hemodynamics and potentially improving quality of life 
the device is designed with the primary goal of stabilizing the progression of heart failure and or recovering remodeling the heart 
we recently conducted the initial first in man implants of symphony outside the us this product is not currently available for sale in the us for the year ended march   we recognized net income of million 
with the exception of fiscal  we have incurred net losses since our inception 
even though we were profitable in fiscal  we may incur additional losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development related to our products  conduct clinical studies and registries on our products  expand our commercial infrastructure and invest in new markets such as japan 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectability of receivables  realizability of inventory  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of long lived assets  accrued expenses  warranty provisions  stock based compensation  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to customers is deferred until all elements of the sale have been delivered 
all costs related to product shipment are recognized at time of shipment 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on our product sales and therefore do not record a provision for returns 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are included in product revenue and are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
revenue is recognized as it is earned in limited instances where we rent console medical devices to customers on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  delays in regulatory approval  other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that no write down for impairment of goodwill was required as the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates  including the probable outcome for awards with a performance condition or conditions 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
the calculation of the fair value of the options is net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we estimate the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historic forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
for awards with service conditions only  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with service and performance conditions  we recognize compensation costs using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period 
accruals of compensation cost for awards with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions 
the cumulative effects of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
based on the available evidence and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income  we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable as of march  and 
table of contents accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax laws  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we accrue for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest 
recently adopted accounting standards in april  we adopted the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices  we allocate consideration to the deliverables based on management s best estimate of the selling prices 
in addition  the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation 
the new accounting standard supersedes the prior multiple element revenue arrangement accounting rules that we previously used 
the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policy in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
under asu  the guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to ensure that fair value has the same meaning in gaap and in ifrs and that their respective fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same 
asu was effective for us on january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb  issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet determined which method of presentation we will use but we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu defers the asu requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income  or aoci in both net income and other comprehensive income  or oci on the face of the financial statements 
companies are still required to present reclassifications in aoci on the face of the financial statements or disclose those amounts in the notes to the financial statements 
the asu also defers the requirement to report reclassification adjustments in interim periods 
asu will be effective for us at the beginning of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this new accounting standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing for goodwill impairment 
asu amends current goodwill impairment testing guidance by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended march  revenues product funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total costs and expenses income loss from operations other income expense investment income  net gain on settlement of investment other expense  net income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella product revenue other products service and other revenue total product revenues funded research and development total revenues impella product revenue encompasses impella  impella  and impella ld product sales 
other product revenue includes ab  bvs and cannulae product sales 
service and other revenue represents revenue earned on service contracts and maintenance calls 
total revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in total revenue was primarily due to higher impella revenue due to greater utilization in the us 
table of contents impella product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella in the us  as we focus on controlled rollouts for new sites and increasing utilization of these products through continued investment in our sales force and physician training 
other product revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decline in bvs and ab disposable sales 
we expect that bvs and ab revenue will continue to decline in fiscal as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on impella and ld 
service and other revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in service contracts  primarily for impella consoles 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella product disposable pumps and improved manufacturing efficiency 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in spending on product development initiatives associated with impella rp  impella cvad and symphony  and was partially offset by a decrease in clinical trial expenditures as we completed our work associated with the protect ii trial for the impella research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial costs primarily associated with our impella us trials 
we expect research and development expenses to increase slightly in fiscal as we continue to focus on product development initiatives associated with impella rp  impella cvad and symphony 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increased field headcount as we concentrated our commercial efforts in the us and increased spending on marketing initiatives as we continued to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support 
we expect to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities in fiscal  with particular investments in clinical personnel with cath lab expertise 
we also plan to increase our marketing  service  and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and field clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
we expect to amortize the remaining net book value of our intangible assets  totaling million  during fiscal gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in fiscal we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
in fiscal we sold our remaining  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
gain on settlement of investment in december  we received million in proceeds in conjunction with a settlement agreement on an investment 

table of contents income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
we have also recorded million in income taxes in fiscal for income taxes in germany that we expect to pay in cash as they are not expected to be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
net income loss during fiscal  we incurred net income of million  or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the net income in fiscal compared to the net loss in fiscal was due primarily to increased impella sales due to greater demand in the us the profitability we achieved in the year ended march  may not be indicative of sustained profitability and we may incur losses from operations in future periods 
any losses incurred in the future may result primarily from  among other things  the expansion of our global distribution network  investment in other foreign markets  the introduction of the us medical device tax and ongoing product development 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella products other products service and other revenue total product revenues funded research and development total revenues total revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue due to greater demand in the us for the impella and  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue  primarily related to bvs and ab impella product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella as we focused on increasing utilization of impella through continued sales force and physician training 
we also generated sales of impella and impella ld in the us in fiscal through the expansion of these applications in the surgery suite following k clearance for these products received in april other product revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decline in bvs and ab disposable sales 
service and other revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in service contracts  primarily for impella consoles 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella product disposable pumps  improved manufacturing efficiency and a lower amount of console placements as we reduced the number of new site openings in fiscal 
table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher clinical trial activity expenditures 
research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella us trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to investments in marketing initiatives and commercial infrastructure to support the expansion of the impella platform 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in fiscal we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
in fiscal we sold our remaining  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of our focus on increasing impella utilization in the us liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at march  we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund the expansion of our commercial infrastructure in the us  increase our impella manufacturing capacity  increase our inventory levels in order to meet increasing customer demand for impella in the us  fund new product development and provide for general working capital needs 
through march   we have funded our operations principally from product sales and through the sale of equity securities 
we also generate cash through funded research and development revenue 
marketable securities at march  consist of million held in funds that invest solely in us treasury securities 
we are not a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we continue to monitor our cash position closely and currently only invest excess cash in short term us treasury securities 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million during the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to the net improvement of million reflected in our net 
table of contents income of million for fiscal compared to our net loss of million in fiscal  offset by changes in assets and liabilities used which consist of a million increase in cash used for inventories in order to meet the increased customer demand for impella in the us  a million increase in cash used for accounts receivable due to increases in sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal and a increase in cash used for accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily related to the closeout of the protect ii study and timing of payments 
in addition  net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by changes in non cash adjustments of a million increase in stock based compensation and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  offset by a million gain on settlement of an investment and a million decrease in write downs of inventory 
during the year ended march   net cash used for investing activities was million  compared to million during the prior year 
the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in net purchases of short term securities  offset by million cash proceeds from settlement of an investment 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million during the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be to million  which relate primarily to capital expenditures for manufacturing capacity increases for impella  leasehold improvements and software development projects 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million and million at march  and march   respectively 
our operating income outside the us is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
we do not intend or currently foresee a need to repatriate cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers ability to pay for our products 
factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients after our products are sold 
we continue to review our long term cash needs on a regular basis 
at march   we had no long term debt outstanding 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year in s total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease commitments contractual obligations total obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and expected liabilities under agreements with third parties  primarily for research and development activities  such as clinical trials 
we have no long term debt  capital leases or other material commitments for open purchase orders and clinical trial agreements at march  other than those shown in the table above 
our operating lease for our facility in danvers  massachusetts expires on february  monthly rent is as follows the base rent for november through june was  per month  the base rent for july through february is  per month  and the base rent for march through february will be  per month 
in addition  we have certain rights to terminate the lease early  subject to the payment of a specified termination fee based on the timing of the termination  as further outlined in the lease amendment 

table of contents we have a lease for our european headquarters in aachen  germany 
the lease payments are approximately  euro approximately us  at march  exchange rates per month and the lease term expires in december we are also party to a license agreement related to certain circulatory care device patents and know how 
under this agreement  we would be obligated to pay up to million in cash or stock  if certain development and regulatory milestones are achieved this amount has not been included in the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty related to the successful achievement of these milestones 
we apply the disclosure provisions of guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions require that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk primary market risk exposures our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
marketable securities at march  consist of million held in funds that invest solely in us treasury securities 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
currency exchange rates we have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and particularly with respect to the euro and british pound 
therefore  our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of stockholders equity 
had a depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
