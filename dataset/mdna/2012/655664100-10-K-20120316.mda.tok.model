risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these are not the only risks we face 
economic conditions we sell high quality apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories  which many consumers consider to be discretionary items 
during economic downturns  fewer customers may shop in our stores and on our website  and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases  all of which may lead to lower sales  higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending in response to lower demand 
deterioration of economic conditions and consumer confidence may also adversely affect our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates  increasing our bad debt expense 
some macroeconomic indicators suggest that a modest economic recovery has begun  however key factors such as employment levels  consumer credit and housing market conditions remain weak 
a sluggish economic recovery or a renewed downturn could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
impact of competitive market forces the fashion specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other national  regional  local and online retailers that may carry similar lines of merchandise  including department stores  specialty stores  off price stores  boutiques and internet businesses 
online retail shopping is rapidly evolving and we expect competition in the e commerce market to intensify in the future as the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping 
if we are unable to remain competitive in the key areas of customer service  the shopping experience across all channels  fashion newness  quality of products  depth of selection  store environment and location  we may lose market share to our competitors and our sales and profitability could suffer 
we believe owning our credit business allows us to fully integrate our loyalty program and drive more sales 
many of our competitors also offer general purpose credit card products with a variety of loyalty programs 
our credit segment faces competition from other retailers  large banks and other credit card companies  some of which have substantial financial resources 
in addition  there is intense competition for cardholders with prime credit ratings who make up a significant portion of our credit portfolio 
if we do not effectively anticipate or respond to the competitive banking and credit card environment  we could lose market share to our competitors  which could have an adverse effect on our credit business 

table of contents ability to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer and our shopping experience  both in store and online  remain current and compelling to our customers 
we make decisions regarding inventory purchases well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
therefore  our ability to predict or respond to constantly changing fashion trends  consumer preferences and spending patterns  and to match our merchandise levels  mix and shopping experience to sales trends and consumer tastes  significantly impacts our sales and operating results 
if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough  we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers 
if we purchase too much inventory  we may be forced to sell our merchandise at higher average markdown levels and lower average margins  which could harm our business 
conversely  if we fail to purchase enough merchandise  we may lose opportunities for additional sales and damage our relationships with our customers 
growth strategy our strategic growth plan focuses on both our stores and on e commerce 
there are risks associated with opening new stores 
the availability and cost of suitable locations for our stores depends on a number of factors  including competition from other retailers and businesses  local land use and other regulations  new shopping center construction and developers financial condition 
new store openings also involve certain risks  including constructing  furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and cost effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location 
our sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could adversely affect our return on investment 
as part of our growth strategy  we also intend to open stores in new and international markets 
expansion will require management attention and resources and may ultimately be unsuccessful  which could harm our future business development 
in addition  competition from strong local competitors  compliance with foreign and local laws and regulatory requirements and potentially unfavorable tax consequences may cause our business to be adversely impacted 
we are also pursuing a heightened focus on technology to enhance our website and mobile capabilities  broaden the selection of our online merchandise offering and improve the speed and quality of our delivery of merchandise to customers 
in addition  other growth opportunities may include acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses  as well as new technologies or other investments to improve the customer shopping experience in our stores and online 
if these technologies and investments do not perform as expected  our profitability and growth could be adversely affected 
leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is important to our long term success 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract  retain  train and develop future leaders  our business may suffer 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace 
if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without adequate succession plans  the loss of the services of any of these individuals  or any negative perceptions of our business as a result of those losses  could damage our brand image and our business 
merchandise planning we are making investments to improve our multi channel merchandise planning  procurement and allocation capabilities 
these efforts involve changes in personnel  processes and technology over a period of several years 
if we encounter challenges associated with change management  the ability to hire and retain key personnel involved in these efforts  implementation of associated information technology or adoption of new processes  our ability to continue to successfully execute our strategy could be adversely affected 
as a result  we may not derive the expected benefits to our sales and profitability  or we may incur increased costs relative to our current projections 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee and company data is vitally important to us 
as we operate in multiple retail channels and maintain our own credit operations  we are subject to privacy  security and cybersecurity risks and incidents 
our business involves the storage and transmission of customers personal information  consumer preferences and credit card information  in addition to employee information and company financial and strategic data 
in addition  we use mobile devices  social networking and other online activities to connect with our customers 
some of our critical systems also depend upon third party providers 
as techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  sabotage systems or otherwise attack our services change frequently and often are unforeseen  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures and they may remain undetected for some period 
concurrently  measures that we may take to prevent risks of fraud and breaches of privacy  security and cybersecurity have the potential to harm relations with our customers or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use or restricting the ability to meet customers expectations in terms of shopping experience 
any measures we implement to prevent a security or cybersecurity risk may not be totally effective 
in addition  the regulatory environment surrounding information security  cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding  with new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
security breaches and cyber incidents and their remediation  whether at our company or our third party providers  could expose us to a risk of loss or misappropriation of this information  litigation  potential liability  reputation damage and loss of customers trust and business 
we have expended  and will continue to expend  significant resources to protect our customers and ourselves against these breaches and to ensure an effective response to an internal or external security or cybersecurity breach  either actual or perceived 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents capital management and liquidity our access to debt and equity capital  and our ability to invest capital to maximize the total returns to our shareholders  is critical to our long term success 
we utilize capital to finance our operations  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  manage our debt levels and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
our ability to obtain capital and the cost of the capital depend on company performance  financial market conditions and independent rating agencies short and long term debt ratings  which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios 
if our access to capital is restricted or if our cost of capital increases  our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
further  if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  our operations  cash flows and returns to shareholders could be adversely affected 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that consumers may associate with a high level of customer service and quality merchandise  and is one of the reasons employees choose nordstrom as a place of employment 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales  diminish customer trust  reduce employee morale and productivity and lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees  any of which would harm our business 
information technology strategy we make investments in information technology and systems developments to advance our competitive position  and we believe they are key to our growth 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption  and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  if we do not maintain our current systems  we may see interruptions to our business and increase our costs in order to bring our systems up to date 
laws  regulations and litigation our policies  procedures and practices are designed to comply with federal  state  local and foreign laws  rules and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  the marketplace  the banking industry and foreign countries  which may change from time to time 
these obligations are complex  continuously evolving and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california  which has increased the cost of compliance 
significant legislative changes  including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform  could impact our relationship with our workforce  which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
possible legislative changes include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units 
recent health care reform could materially increase our employee related costs and if it is necessary to make changes to the health benefits provided to our employees as a result of health care reform  we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  legal and settlement costs  civil and criminal liability  increased cost of regulatory compliance  restatements of our financial statements  disruption of our business and loss of customers 
any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees  reduced sales  increased employment costs  low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations 
in addition  political and economic factors could lead to unfavorable changes in federal and state tax laws which may increase our tax liabilities 
an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
financial system reforms the recent financial crisis resulted in increased legislative and regulatory changes affecting the financial industry 
the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing  finance charges and fees  customer billing practices and payment application 
these rules required us to make changes to our credit card business practices and systems  and we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge 
depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules  and any interpretations or additional rules  the revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in july it significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry  creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending 
numerous regulations will be issued in the near future to implement the requirements of this act 
the final regulatory details remain uncertain at this time 
depending on the nature and extent of these regulations  and the enforcement approach of regulators under the new law  there could be an adverse impact to our credit segment 
availability and cost of merchandise our relationships with our merchandise vendors have been a significant contributor to our success and our position as a retailer of high quality fashion merchandise 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our key vendors  many of whom limit the number of retail channels they use to sell their merchandise 
competition to obtain and sell this merchandise is intense 
nearly all of the brands of our top vendors are sold by competing retailers  and many of our top vendors also have their own dedicated retail stores and websites 
if one or more of our top vendors were to limit or reduce our access to their merchandise  our business could be adversely affected 
further  if our merchandise costs increase due to increased raw material or labor costs or other factors  our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our sales or gross margins 

table of contents consumer credit our credit card operations help drive sales in our stores  allow our stores to avoid third party transaction fees and generate additional revenues from extending credit 
our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  interest rates  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  unemployment trends  laws and regulations and other factors 
elevated levels of unemployment have historically corresponded with increased credit card delinquencies and write offs  which may continue in the future 
further  these economic conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria and or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses 
this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
business continuity our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions  severe weather patterns  natural disasters  widespread pandemics and other natural or man made disruptions 
we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts of the united states  particularly in california  which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions 
these disruptions could cause  among other things  a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales  staffing shortages in our stores  distribution centers or corporate offices  interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores  disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers  increased costs  and a negative impact on our reputation and long term growth plans 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that the shareholder became an acquiring person

table of contents free cash flow non gaap financial measure we define free cash flow as free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures cash dividends paid change in credit card receivables originated at third parties change in cash book overdrafts free cash flow is one of our key liquidity measures  and in conjunction with gaap measures  provides us with a meaningful analysis of our cash flows 
we believe that our ability to generate cash is more appropriately analyzed using this measure 
free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating cash flows as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  free cash flow does have limitations free cash flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs  and other companies in our industry may calculate free cash flow differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
to compensate for these limitations  we analyze free cash flow in conjunction with other gaap financial and performance measures impacting liquidity  including operating cash flows 
the closest gaap measure calculated using gaap amounts is net cash provided by operating activities  which was  for each of the months ended january  and january  the following is a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures less cash dividends paid less change in credit card receivables originated at third parties less add change in cash book overdrafts free cash flow net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities credit capacity and commitments as of january   we had total short term borrowing capacity available for general corporate purposes of of the total capacity  we had under our commercial paper program  which is backed by our unsecured revolving credit facility revolver and under our a variable funding note a vfn 
during  we entered into a new revolver with a capacity of  which expires in june this revolver replaced our previous unsecured line of credit which was scheduled to expire in august under the terms of the revolver  we pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee based on our debt rating 
the revolver is available for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including liquidity support for our commercial paper program 
we have the option to increase the revolving commitment by up to  to a total of  provided that we obtain written consent from the new lenders 
during  we had no borrowings under our revolver 
our commercial paper program allows us to use the proceeds to fund share repurchases as well as operating cash requirements 
under the terms of the commercial paper agreement  we pay a rate of interest based on  among other factors  the maturity of the issuance and market conditions 
the issuance of commercial paper has the effect  while it is outstanding  of reducing borrowing capacity under our revolver by an amount equal to the principal amount of commercial paper 
during  we had no outstanding issuances under our commercial paper program 
during  we amended the terms of our a vfn to reduce the borrowing capacity to  maturing in january  from the previous facility 
the a vfn is backed by all of the nordstrom private label card receivables and a interest in the co branded nordstrom visa credit card receivables 
borrowings under the a vfn incur interest based upon one month libor plus basis points 
we pay a commitment fee for the notes based on the size of the commitment 
during  we had no borrowings against this facility 
our wholly owned federal savings bank  nordstrom fsb  also maintains a variable funding facility with a short term credit capacity of this facility is backed by the remaining interest in the nordstrom visa credit card receivables and is available  if needed  to provide liquidity support to nordstrom fsb

table of contents our next debt maturity is in april for our securitized series class a b notes 
in connection with this debt maturity  we began making monthly cash deposits into a restricted account in december as of january   we had accumulated  which is included in our consolidated balance sheet in prepaid expense and other 
after evaluating credit markets and our financing needs as we approached this maturity  we issued of senior unsecured notes and of securitized series class a notes  in the second half of this will allow us to maintain an adjusted debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ratio within our targeted range 
we continue to monitor credit markets and our potential future financing needs in order to ensure we have adequate cash on hand 
in the first quarter of  we expect to retire the series class a b notes with the accumulated restricted cash upon maturity 
we maintain trade and standby letters of credit to facilitate international payments 
as of january   we have available under a trade letter of credit  with outstanding 
we additionally hold a standby letter of credit  with outstanding under this facility at the end of the year 
impact of credit ratings under the terms of our revolver  any borrowings we may enter into will accrue interest at a floating base rate tied to libor in the case of euro dollar rate loans and to the highest of i the euro dollar rate plus basis points  ii the federal funds rate plus basis points and iii the prime rate in the case of base rate loans 
the rate depends upon the type of borrowing incurred  plus in each case an applicable margin 
this applicable margin varies depending upon the credit ratings assigned to our long term unsecured debt 
at the time of this report  our long term unsecured debt ratings  outlook and resulting applicable margin were as follows credit ratings outlook moody s baa stable standard poor s a stable base interest rate applicable margin euro dollar rate loan libor base rate loan various should the ratings assigned to our long term unsecured debt improve  the applicable margin associated with any such borrowings may decrease  resulting in a slightly lower cost of capital under this facility 
should the ratings assigned to our long term unsecured debt worsen  the applicable margin associated with our borrowings may increase  resulting in a slightly higher cost of capital under this facility 
debt covenants the revolver requires that we maintain a leverage ratio  defined as adjusted debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar  of less than four times see the following additional discussion of adjusted debt to ebitdar 
as of january  and january   we were in compliance with this covenant 
we will continue to monitor this covenant to ensure that we make any necessary adjustments to our plans  and we believe that we will remain in compliance with this covenant during 
table of contents adjusted debt to ebitdar non gaap financial measure adjusted debt to ebitdar is one of our key financial metrics  and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure 
our current goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment grade credit rating as well as operate with an efficient capital structure for our size  growth plans and industry 
investment grade credit ratings are important to maintaining access to a variety of short term and long term sources of funding  and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business 
we believe a higher ratio  among other factors  could result in rating agency downgrades 
in contrast  we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns 
as of january   our adjusted debt to ebitdar was compared with as of january  the increase was primarily the result of increased levels of debt as a result of new borrowings during  a portion of which was done in anticipation of pre funding our next debt maturity in april for our securitized series class a b notes 
adjusted debt to ebitdar is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings  net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  adjusted debt to ebitdar does have limitations adjusted debt is not exact  but rather our best estimate of the total company debt we would hold if we had purchased the property and issued debt associated with our operating leases  ebitdar does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  including leases  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted debt to ebitdar differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
to compensate for these limitations  we analyze adjusted debt to ebitdar in conjunction with other gaap financial and performance measures impacting liquidity  including operating cash flows  capital spending and net earnings 
the closest measure calculated using gaap amounts is debt to net earnings  which was and for and the following is a comparison of debt to net earnings and adjusted debt to ebitdar debt add rent expense x less fair value hedge adjustment included in long term debt adjusted debt net earnings add income tax expense add interest expense  net earnings before interest and income taxes add depreciation and amortization expenses add rent expense add non cash acquisition related charges ebitdar debt to net earnings adjusted debt to ebitdar the components of adjusted debt are as of january  and january   while the components of ebitdar are for the months ended january  and january  the multiple of eight times rent expense used to calculate adjusted debt is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease  or we had purchased the property

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of january  we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of  as of january   payable over the remaining life of the debts 
the capital and operating lease obligations in the table above do not include payments for operating expenses that are required by most of our lease agreements 
such expenses  which include common area charges  real estate taxes and other executory costs  totaled in  in and in in addition  some of our leases require additional rental payments based on a percentage of our sales  referred to as percentage rent 
percentage rent  which is also excluded from the obligations in the table above  was in and in each of and purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments 
other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits 
the payment amounts presented above were estimated based on historical payment trends 
other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments  such as deferred property incentives and deferred revenue  were excluded from the table above 
also excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash payments  if any  for these liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into commitments to extend credit to customers for use at third parties through our nordstrom visa credit cards 
the unused credit card capacity available to our customers represents an off balance sheet commitment 
as of january   this unfunded commitment was  we had no other off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  during critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that follow 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit card receivables as of the balance sheet date  including uncollectible finance charges and fees 
we estimate such credit losses based on several factors  including historical aging and delinquency trends  write off experience  concentration and risk metrics  and general economic conditions 
we believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations 
during  our delinquency and net write off results continued the improvements began in as a result of these improvements  we reduced our allowance for credit losses by during  from to  and by during  from to a change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale  net of an allowance for estimated sales returns 
revenue from our sales to customers shipped directly from our stores and our online and catalog sales includes shipping revenue  when applicable  and is recognized upon estimated receipt by the customer 
we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns  there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve 
a change in the sales return reserve would have had a impact on our net earnings for the year ended january  inventory our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
we do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve 
a change in the obsolescence reserve would not have had a material effect on our net earnings for the year ended january  goodwill we review our goodwill annually for impairment  or when circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  comprised of the principal business units within our retail segment 
to assess the fair value of our hautelook goodwill  we utilize both an income approach and a market approach 
to determine the fair value of goodwill related to nordstrom 
com and jeffrey  we utilize a market approach 
we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill 
as part of our impairment testing  we utilize certain assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors 
significant estimates in the market approach include identifying similar companies and acquisitions with comparable business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return of investment and assessing comparable earnings or revenue multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
assumptions in the income approach include future cash flows for the business  future growth rates and discount rates 
estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model or changes in operating performance 
based on the results of our review  we recognized an impairment charge of related to our hautelook goodwill 
we did not recognize an impairment loss for goodwill in a change in our fair value measurement for hautelook goodwill would have impacted net earnings by approximately for the fiscal year ended january  income taxes we regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal  state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances and information available to us 
if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained  we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
our unrecognized tax benefit was as of january  and as of january  unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances 
also  as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse  it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable  deferred tax assets  tax reserves or income tax expense 
such adjustments did not materially impact our effective income tax rate in or recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect any of these pronouncements to have a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in millions interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in short term interest rates 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of  which generate interest income at variable rates  and gross credit card receivables of  which generate finance charge income at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
additionally  we have long term debt of  including that bears interest at floating libor based rates and is scheduled to mature in april interest rate fluctuations can affect our interest income  credit card revenues and interest expense 
see note accounts receivable and note debt and credit facilities in item for additional information 
we use sensitivity analyses to measure and assess our interest rate risk exposure 
for purposes of presenting the potential earnings effect of a reasonably possible hypothetical change in interest rates from our reporting date  we utilized two sensitivity scenarios i linear growth of approximately basis points over the year  and ii linear decline of approximately basis points over the year  due to the fact that current interest rates are at or near historically low levels 
other key parameters and assumptions in our sensitivity analyses include the average cash and cash equivalents balance  average credit card receivables balance and no new floating rate debt issuance 
the first hypothetical scenario would result in an approximate increase in future earnings  while the second hypothetical scenario would not have a material effect on future earnings 
we occasionally enter into interest rate swaps typically to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
we did not have interest rate swaps on our debt as of january   although we continue to amortize  as a reduction of interest expense  the remaining adjustment to long term debt originating from gains realized on previously designated fair value hedges 
for our long term fixed rate debt  our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the change in fair value of the debt 
as of january   the fair value of our fixed rate debt was  foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenues  expenses and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
however  we periodically enter into merchandise purchase orders denominated primarily in euros 
from time to time we may use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices 
as of january   we had no outstanding forward contracts
