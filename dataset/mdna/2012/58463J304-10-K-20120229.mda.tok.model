item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless otherwise indicated  references to our  we and us in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to medical properties trust  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  including mpt operating partnership  lp overview we were incorporated in maryland on august  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased healthcare facilities across the united states 
we also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants 
we conduct our business operations in one segment 
we have operated as a reit since april   and accordingly  elected reit status upon the filing in september of our calendar year federal income tax return 
our existing tenants are  and our prospective tenants will generally be  healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations 
we offer financing for these operators real estate through lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long term basis ranging from to years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers 
we also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases 
our existing portfolio minimum escalators range from to  while a limited number of our properties do not have an escalator 
most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases 
in addition to the base rent  our leases require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility 
some leases also require our tenants to pay percentage rents  which are based on the level of those tenants revenues from their operations 
finally  from time to time we acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant s income or loss 
we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable reit subsidiaries  which they use for acquisitions and working capital 
we consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons it provides opportunities to make income earning investments that yield attractive risk adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise  and by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators  we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of  and financing sources for  healthcare facilities 
at december   our portfolio consisted of properties healthcare facilities of the facilities that we own are leased to tenants  one is presently not under lease  four are under development  and the remainder are in the form of mortgage loans collateralized by interests in health care real estate to one operator

critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances 
we believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of our revenues  credit losses  fair values either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analysis and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets  and stock compensation expense  along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results  have significant effects on our financial statements 
each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments 
we rely on our experience  collect historical and current market data  and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting 
table of contents 
index to financial statements policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
our accounting estimates include the following revenue recognition we receive income from operating leases based on the fixed  minimum required rents base rents per the lease agreements 
rent revenue from base rents is recorded on the straight line method over the terms of the related lease agreements for new leases and the remaining terms of existing leases for acquired properties 
the straight line method records the periodic average amount of base rent earned over the term of a lease  taking into account contractual rent increases over the lease term 
the straight line method typically has the effect of recording more rent revenue from a lease than a tenant is required to pay early in the term of the lease 
during the later parts of a lease term  this effect reverses with less rent revenue recorded than a tenant is required to pay 
rent revenue as recorded on the straight line method in the consolidated statements of income is presented as two amounts billed rent revenue and straight line revenue 
billed rent revenue is the amount of base rent actually billed to the customer each period as required by the lease 
straight line rent revenue is the difference between rent revenue earned based on the straight line method and the amount recorded as billed rent revenue 
we record the difference between base rent revenues earned and amounts due per the respective lease agreements  as applicable  as an increase or decrease to straight line rent receivable 
certain leases provide for additional rents contingent upon a percentage of the tenant revenue in excess of specified base amounts thresholds percentage rents 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which revenue thresholds are met 
rental payments received prior to their recognition as income are classified as deferred revenue 
we may also receive additional rent contingent rent under some leases when the us department of labor consumer price index exceeds the annual minimum percentage increase in the lease 
contingent rents are recorded as billed rent revenue in the period earned 
in instances where we have a profits interest in our tenant s operations  we record revenue equal to our percentage interest of the tenant s profits  as defined in the lease or tenant s operating agreements  once annual thresholds  if any  are met 
we begin recording base rent income from our development projects when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility  which may be different from the stated start date of the lease 
also  during construction of our development projects  we are generally entitled to accrue rent based on the cost paid during the construction period construction period rent 
we accrue construction period rent as a receivable and deferred revenue during the construction period 
when the lessee takes physical possession of the facility  we begin recognizing the accrued construction period rent on the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease 
we receive interest income from our tenants borrowers on mortgage loans  working capital loans  and other long term loans 
interest income from these loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal outstanding and terms of the loans 
commitment fees received from development and leasing services for lessees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the initial term of an operating lease to produce a constant effective yield on the lease interest method 
commitment and origination fees from lending services are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the life of the loan using the interest method 
investments in real estate 
we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility  to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance  we expense those costs as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the weighted average useful life of years for buildings and improvements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements when circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments which was the case with our denham springs facility during  we review the recoverability of the facility s carrying value 
the review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  from the facility s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends  and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to inability to recover the carrying value of a facility  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility 
we do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at december  or  however  given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken 
acquired real estate purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we record above market and below market in place lease values  if any  for the facilities we own which are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize any resulting capitalized above market lease values as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize any resulting capitalized below market lease values as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long term lease arrangements at market rates relative to our acquisition costs  we do not expect the above market and below market in place lease values to be significant for many of our anticipated transactions 
we measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant when acquired 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing  and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which we expect to be about six months depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal costs  and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
other intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values  which are based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which have a weighted average useful life of years at december  the value of customer relationship intangibles  if any  is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
if a lease is terminated  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense 
at december   we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles 
loans loans consist of mortgage loans  working capital loans and other long term loans 
mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property 
working capital and other long term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees 
we record loans at cost 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal for each of our loans to determine whether they are impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loans effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
losses from rent receivables a provision for losses on rent receivables including straight line rent receivables is recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full 
the provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from the collateral  if any 
stock based compensation 
during the years ended december    and we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  of expense for share based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock  deferred stock units and other stock based awards 
in   and  we granted performance based restricted share awards that vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions as defined by the accounting rules 
market conditions are vesting conditions which are based on our stock price levels or our total shareholder return stock price and dividends compared to an index of other reit stocks 
because these awards vest based on the achievement of these market conditions  we must initially evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving those market conditions in order to determine the fair value of the award and over what period we should recognize stock compensation expense 
for example  in  the compensation committee made awards which are earned only if we achieve certain stock price levels  total shareholder return or other market conditions 
the awards were made pursuant to our multi year incentive plan mip adopted by the compensation committee and consisted of three components service based awards  core performance awards cpre  and superior performance awards spre 
the service based awards vest annually and ratably over a seven year period 
we recognize expense over the vesting period on the straight line method for service based awards 
the cpre and spre awards vest based on the achievement of certain market conditions 
only one third of the spre awards were earned as of december  with the remainder being forfeited  however  these awards require additional service after being earned in order to vest 
for the cpre awards  the period over which the awards are earned is not fixed because the awards provide for cumulative measures over multiple years 
the accounting rules require that we estimate the period over which the awards will likely be earned  regardless of the period over which the award allows as the maximum period over which it can be earned 
also  because some awards have multiple periods over which they can be earned  we must segregate individual awards into tranches  based on their vesting or estimated earning periods 
these complexities required us to use an independent consultant to assist us in modeling both the value of the award and the various periods over which each tranche of an award will be earned 
we used what is termed a monte carlo simulation model which determines a value and earnings periods based on multiple outcomes and their probabilities 
beginning in  we recorded expense over the expected or derived vesting periods using the calculated value of the awards 
we recorded expense over these vesting periods even though the awards have not yet been earned and  in fact  may never be earned

index to financial statements principles of consolidation property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated 
all inter company balances and transactions are eliminated 
for entities in which we own less than of the equity interest  we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities activities based upon the terms of the respective entities ownership agreements 
for these entities  we record a non controlling interest representing equity held by non controlling interests 
we continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity 
if we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity  we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
the evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
we consolidate each variable interest entity in which we  by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity  are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
at december  and  we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any of our variable interest entities because we do not control the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations  or ffo  as a supplemental performance measure 
while we believe net income available to common stockholders  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is the most appropriate measure  our management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity

it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward 
the table below is a summary of our distributions declared for the three year period ended december  declaration date record date date of distribution distribution per share november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  november  december  january  august  september  october  may  june  july  february  march  april  we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code code  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a reit under the code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in addition  the value of our facilities will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the ability of our tenants to generate profits  all of which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary 
the changes in the value of our facilities would be impacted also by changes in cap rates  which is measured by the current base rent divided by the current market value of a facility 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates and equity prices as if these changes had occurred 
the hypothetical changes chosen for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in market conditions 
in addition  they do not include measures we may take to minimize our exposure such as entering into future interest rate swaps to hedge against interest rate increases on our variable rate debt

index to financial statements interest rate sensitivity for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   our outstanding debt totaled million  which consisted of fixed rate debt of million including million of floating debt swapped to fixed and variable rate debt of million 
if market interest rates increase by one percentage point  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would decrease by million 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we decided to repurchase the debt in the open markets 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million per year 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by million per year 
this assumes that the average amount outstanding under our variable rate debt for a year is million  the balance of our revolver at december  share price sensitivity in the third quarter  we funded a cash tender offer for of the outstanding exchangeable notes at a weighted average price of of the principal amount or million plus accrued and unpaid interest leaving only million of these notes outstanding as of december  our exchangeable notes have a conversion adjustment feature  which could affect their stated exchange ratio of common shares per  principal amount of notes  equating to an exchange price of per common share 
our dividends declared since we sold the exchangeable notes have not adjusted our conversion price as of december  future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
any adjustments for dividend increases until the exchangeable notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they may eventually be settled 
using the outstanding notes and  assuming a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional million shares
