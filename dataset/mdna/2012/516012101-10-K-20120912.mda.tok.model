part i item description of business business overview lannett company  inc and subsidiaries the company  lannett  we  or us was incorporated in under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation 
we develop  manufacture  market and distribute generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products 
we report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended june  all references herein to a fiscal year or fiscal refer to the applicable fiscal year ending june according to data reported by ims health in august  we are currently among the top companies  based on number of prescription transactions  for unbranded generic products in the united states 
we intend to grow our business organically as well as through strategic partnerships 
additionally  our levothyroxine sodium tablets levo were recognized by ims health as the th most prescribed pharmaceutical product  including both branded and generic products  in the us over the past year  reaching approximately million prescriptions for the twelve months ended june this product line represents approximately of the domestic prescription market 
over the past five years  we have experienced a growth in net sales from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year this growth has been achieved primarily through strategic partnerships and launches of additional manufactured drugs as well as opportunities resulting from our exceptional compliance with regulations 
competitive strengths proven ability to develop successful products and achieve scale in production 
we believe that our ability to select viable products for development  efficiently develop such products  including obtaining any applicable regulatory approvals  vertically integrate into certain markets and achieve economies of scale in production are critical for our success in the generic pharmaceutical industry in which we operate 
we intend to focus on long term profitability while seeking to secure market positions with fewer challenges from competitors 
two key examples are morphine sulfate oral solution and hydromorphone hcl tablets 

table of contents efficient development systems and manufacturing expertise for new products 
we believe that our manufacturing expertise  low overhead expenses  efficient product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities can help us remain competitive in the general pharmaceutical market 
we intend to dedicate significant capital toward developing new products because we believe our success is linked to our ability to continually introduce new generic products into the marketplace 
competition from new and other market participants for the manufacture and distribution of certain products would likely affect our market share with respect to such products as well as force us to reduce our selling price for such products due to their increased availability 
as a result  we believe that our success depends on our ability to properly assess the competitive market of new products  including market share  the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion 
we intend to reduce our exposure to competitive influences that may negatively affect our sales and profits  including the potential saturation of the market for certain products  by continuing to emphasize maintenance of a strong research and development r d pipeline 
mutually beneficial supply and distribution arrangements 
in  we entered into an exclusive ten year distribution agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceuticals jsp covering four different product lines 
two of these product lines  levo and digoxin  collectively accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal year and both products have experienced significant market growth in sales over the past few years 
preliminary discussions have been held with jsp over contract renewal 
distribution agreements with other manufacturers have also increased our net sales in recent years 
dependable supplier to our customers 
we believe we are viewed within the generic pharmaceutical industry as a strong  dependable supplier to our customer base 
we have cultivated strong and dependable customer relationships by maintaining adequate inventory levels  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders 
a majority of our orders are filled and shipped either on the day of  or the day following  the date that we receive the order 
strong track record of obtaining regulatory approvals for new products 
during the past two fiscal years  we have received ten approved abbreviated new drug applications each  an anda and one nda from the food and drug administration the fda 
we expect to receive several more during the next fiscal year 
these regulatory approvals will enable us to manufacture and supply a broader portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products 
reputation for regulatory compliance 
we have a strong track record of regulatory compliance and we believe that we have strong effective regulatory compliance capabilities and practices through hiring qualified individuals and implementing strong current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
two of our competitive strengths  our agility in responding quickly to market events and a strong reputation for regulatory compliance  position us to avail ourselves of market opportunities 
in addition  narcotics which are classified by the dea as controlled drugs are subject to a rigorous regulatory compliance regimen 
we are one of seven companies in the us that have been granted a license from the us drug enforcement administration dea to import raw concentrated poppy straw for conversion into active pharmaceutical ingredients api 
such licenses are renewed annually  and non compliance could result in a license not being renewed 
as a result  we believe that our strong reputation for regulatory compliance allows us to have a competitive edge in managing the production and distribution of narcotics and controlled drugs 
business strategies continue to broaden our product lines through internal development and strategic partnerships 
we are focused on increasing our market share in the generic pharmaceutical industry while concentrating additional resources on the development of new products  including narcotics and other controlled drugs 
we continue our efforts to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products  increasing unit sales to current customers  creating manufacturing efficiencies  and managing our overhead and administrative costs 
we have targeted four strategies for expanding our product offerings deploying our experienced r d staff to develop products in house  entering into additional product development agreements or strategic partnerships with third party product developers and formulators  purchasing andas from other generic manufacturers and marketing drugs under brand names 
we expect that each method will facilitate our identification  selection and development of additional generic pharmaceutical products that we may distribute through our existing network of customers 
we have several existing supply and development agreements with both international and domestic companies  and are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with additional international companies  through which we can market and distribute future products 
we intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build our market share for such products 
improve our operating profile in certain targeted specialty markets 
in certain situations  we may increase our focus on certain specialty markets within the generic pharmaceutical industry 
by narrowing our focus to specialty markets  we can provide increased 
table of contents product alternatives in categories with relatively few other market participants 
we plan to strengthen our relationships with strategic partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  api and finished products 
we believe that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could enhance our competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
leverage ability to vertically integrate as a manufacturer  supplier and distributor of narcotics and controlled drugs 
we view our april acquisition of cody laboratories  inc cody labs or cody as an important step in becoming a vertically integrated narcotics manufacturer and distributor by allowing us to concentrate on developing and completing our dosage form manufacturing in order to reduce our narcotic api costs 
in july  the dea granted cody labs a license to directly import raw concentrated poppy straw for conversion into api 
only six other companies in the us have been granted this license to date 
this license will allow us to avoid increased costs associated with buying narcotic api from other manufacturers 
we anticipate that we can use this license to become a vertically integrated manufacturer of narcotic products  as well as a supplier of api to the pharmaceutical industry 
market indicators have shown us that the aging domestic population will likely result in a higher demand for pain management pharmaceutical products and controlled substances 
cody labs manufacturing expertise in narcotic apis will allow us to build a market with limited domestic competition 
we anticipate that demand for narcotics and other controlled drugs will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation ages 
we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities by concentrating additional resources in the narcotics and other controlled drugs area 
key products all of our products currently manufactured and or sold are prescription products 
of the products listed in the table entitled current products below  our top five products in each fiscal year collectively accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our products containing levo are produced and marketed with varying potencies 
in addition to generic levo tablets  we also market and distribute unithroid tablets  a branded version of levo  which is produced and marketed with varying potencies 
both generic levo tablets and unithroid tablets are manufactured by jsp 
we began buying generic levo from jsp and selling it to our customers in april in september  we began buying the branded unithroid tablets from jsp and selling them to our customers 
levo tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders 
levo remains one of the most prescribed drugs in the us and is used by patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds 
we signed a distribution agreement with jsp in march that granted us exclusive distribution rights to levo tablets through march the jsp distribution agreement 
in june  jsp received a letter from the fda approving its supplemental application for generic bioequivalence to levoxyl 
in december  jsp received a letter from the fda approving its supplemental application for generic bioequivalence to synthroid 
net sales of levo have grown in recent years from approximately million in to almost million in in our distribution of these products  we compete with two branded levo products abbott laboratories synthroid and monarch pharmaceutical s levoxyl as well as generic products from mylan and sandoz 
digoxin tablets are produced and marketed with two different potencies 
this product is manufactured by jsp and we distribute it under the jsp distribution agreement 
we began buying this product from jsp and selling it to our customers in september digoxin tablets are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds 
net sales of this product have increased from approximately million in to million in in our distribution of these products  we compete with three similar generic products from caraco  impax  and west ward 
we distribute two products containing butalbital 
we have manufactured and sold one of the products  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules  for more than years 
the other butalbital product  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules  is manufactured by jsp 
we began buying this product from jsp and selling it to our customers in december both butalbital products  which are in orally administered capsule dosage forms  are prescribed to treat tension headaches caused by contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulder area and migraines 
the drug is prescribed primarily for adults of various demographic backgrounds 
migraine headaches are an increasingly prevalent condition in the united states 
as conditions continue to grow  we believe the demand for effective medical treatments will continue to grow 
although new innovator drugs to treat migraine headaches have been introduced by brand name drug companies  we believe that there is still a loyal following of doctors and consumers who prefer to use butalbital products for treatment 
morphine sulfate oral solution is produced and marketed in three different size containers 
we manufacture these solution dosage forms at our cody labs subsidiary and are currently finishing the manufacturing methods and capabilities to make the api 
this drug is prescribed primarily for the management of pain in adults where other products or delivery methods are not tolerable to the patient 
as recently as march  nine different companies  including lannett  were manufacturing and or distributing this product 
as a 
table of contents result of actions by the fda during fiscal years and see item government regulation  six of those companies  including lannett  left the market by july from july through june  only one company had an approved nda for this product and enjoyed market exclusivity selling it 
in june  lannett became the second approved manufacturer of this product 
lannett resumed sales of this product during the first fiscal quarter of cocaine topical solution c topical is produced and marketed under a preliminary new drug application pind in two different strengths and two different size containers 
we manufacture these liquid dosage forms at our cody labs subsidiary and we expect to complete finishing the manufacturing methods and capabilities to make the api commercially within the next fiscal year 
sales of c topical approximated of lannett s net sales during fiscal this drug is utilized primarily for the anesthetization of the patient during ear  nose or throat surgery 
it also works as a vasoconstrictor 
validated pharmaceutical capabilities our  square foot manufacturing facility sits on approximately acres of company owned land 
in addition  we own a  square foot building residing on approximately acres of company owned land 
this facility is located within one mile of our manufacturing facility 
the facility houses packaging  research and development  and has capacity for additional manufacturing space  if needed 
in october  we purchased a  square foot building on acres of land  for approximately million  plus the cost of fit out of approximately million 
this facility is being used for certain administrative functions  warehouse space and shipping and has capacity for additional manufacturing space  if needed 
the manufacturing facility of our wholly owned subsidiary  cody labs  consists of an approximately  square foot facility located on approximately acres of land in cody  wyoming 
cody labs leases the facility from cody lci realty  llc  which is owned by lannett and by an officer of cody labs 
cody labs manufacturing facility currently has capacity for further expansion  both inside and outside the existing structure 
we have adopted many new processes in support of regulations relating to cgmps in the last several years  and we believe we are operating our facilities in material compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations 
in designing our facilities  full attention was given to material flow  equipment and automation  quality control and inspection 
a granulator  an automatic film coating machine  high speed tablet presses  blenders  encapsulators  fluid bed dryers  high shear mixers  and high speed bottle filling are a few examples of the sophisticated product development  manufacturing and packaging equipment used in the production process 
in addition  our quality control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments  such as automated liquid chromatographs  gas chromatographs  robots and laser particle size analyzers 
we continue to pursue our comprehensive plan entitled quality by design for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs in our pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities 
the fda periodically inspects our production facilities to determine our compliance with the fda s manufacturing standards 
typically  after completing its inspection  the fda will issue a report  entitled a form  containing observations arising from an inspection 
the fda s observations may be minor or severe in nature and the degree of severity is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  any consequences to the consumer of the products  and whether the observation is subject to a warning letter from the fda 
by strictly complying with cgmps and the various fda guidelines  and good laboratory practices glps  as well as adherence to our standard operating procedures  we have successfully minimized the number of observations in our fda inspections in recent years  and in years of business have never received a cgmp warning letter 
research and development process over the past several years  we have heavily invested in r d projects  including new generic product offerings 
the costs of these r d efforts are expensed during the periods incurred 
we believe that such costs may be recovered in future years when we receive marketing approval from the fda to distribute such products 
in addition to using cash generated from our operations  we have entered into financing agreements with third parties to provide additional cash when needed 
these financing agreements are more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
we have embarked on a plan to grow in future years  which includes organic growth to be achieved through r d efforts  as well as efforts in our specialty pharma unit which has initiated marketing projects in order to expand future revenue 
we expect that our growing list of generic products under development will drive future growth 
over the past several years  we have hired additional personnel in product development  production  formulation and the r d laboratory 
we also intend to use our r d infrastructure to continually devote resources to additional r d projects 
the following steps outline the numerous stages in the generic drug development process formulation and analytical method development 
after a drug candidate is selected for future sale  product development scientists perform various experiments on the incorporation of active ingredients into a dosage form 
these experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for our 
table of contents subsequent development process 
various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator drug 
during this time  we may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients 
during the formulation phase  our r d chemists begin to develop an analytical  laboratory testing method 
the successful development of this test method will allow us to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future 
all of the information used in the final formulation  including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate  will be included as part of the chemistry  manufacturing and controls section of the anda submitted to the fda in the generic drug application 
scale up 
after product development scientists and the r d chemists agree on a final formulation for use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process  we then attempt to increase the batch size of the product 
the batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product 
the determination of batch size affects the amount of raw material that is input into the manufacturing process and the number of expected dosages to be created during the production cycle 
we attempt to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage  the available production equipment and unit sales projections 
the scaled up batch is then generally produced in our commercial manufacturing facilities 
during this manufacturing process  we document the equipment used  the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product 
this information  generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process  is included in the anda submitted to the fda 
clinical testing 
after a successful scale up of the generic drug batch  we schedule and perform bioequivalency  and in some cases clinical  testing procedures on the product if required by the fda 
these procedures  which are generally outsourced to third parties  include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug 
the results of this testing are then documented and reported to us to determine the success of the generic drug product 
success  in this context  means that we are able to demonstrate that our product is comparable to the innovator product in dosage form  strength  route of administration  quality  performance characteristics and intended use 
since bioequivalence meaning that the product performs in the same manner and in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the fda s cgmps  lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy  which are required by the fda for innovator drug approvals  are typically unnecessary for generic companies 
if the results are successful  we will continue the collection of documentation and information for assembly of the drug application 
submission of the anda for fda review and approval 
the anda process became formalized under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  also known as the hatch waxman act hatch waxman act 
the hatch waxman act amended the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdca to permit the fda to review and approve an anda for a generic equivalent of a new drug product  which previously received fda approval through its new drug approval process  without having the generic drug company conduct costly clinical trials 
an anda is a comprehensive submission that contains  among other things  data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient  drug product formulation  specifications and stability of the generic drug  as well as analytical methods  manufacturing process validation data  and quality control procedures 
according to information obtained from the fda  the current fda average review time for andas exceeds months 
while we have received approval for some of our andas in months  we have also waited longer than months before receiving approval 
subsequently  the fda advised that electronic submissions of applications may shorten the approval process 
we currently file our andas and ndas electronically 
andas and ndas submitted for our products may not receive fda approval on a timely basis 
when a generic drug company files an anda with the fda  it must certify that no patents are listed in the orange book  the fda s reference listing of approved drugs and listed patents 
an anda filer must certify  with respect to each application whether the filer is challenging a patent  either i that no patent was filed for the listed drug a paragraph i certification  ii that the patent has expired a paragraph ii certification  iii that the patent will expire on a specified date and the anda filer will not market the drug until that date a paragraph iii certification  or iv that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture  use  or sale of the new drug a paragraph iv certification 
a paragraph iv certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved anda to which the anda refers 
a paragraph iv certification can trigger an automatic month stay of the anda if the innovator company files a claim which would delay the approval of the generic company s anda 
currently  we have filed no paragraph iv certifications with our andas 
sales and customer relationships we sell our pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors  drug wholesalers  chain drug retailers  private label distributors  mail order pharmacies  other pharmaceutical manufacturers  managed care organizations  hospital buying groups  
table of contents governmental entities and health maintenance organizations 
we promote our products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications and bids 
we continue to expand our sales to major chain drug stores 
our policies of maintaining an adequate inventory  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of those orders have contributed to a strong reputation among our customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals 
some of our new generic products were developed and are manufactured by us while other products were developed and manufactured by other companies 
the products currently manufactured by us and those manufactured by others are identified in the section entitled current products in item of this form k 
management we have been focused on increasing the size and quality of our management team in anticipation of continuing our growth 
we have hired experienced personnel from large  established  brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team 
as we continue to grow  additional personnel may need to be added to our management team 
we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge base and expertise within our personnel ranks

table of contents we have additional products currently under development 
these products are either orally administered  solid dosage products ie tablet capsule or oral solutions  topicals or parentarels designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
our developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  clinical testing and fda review 
the cost associated with each product that we are currently developing is dependent on numerous factors  including but not limited to  the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the price of the raw materials and the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies depending on the fda s orange book classification 
the average estimated cost to develop a new generic product ranges from approximately million to million 
in addition  we currently own several andas that are dormant for products which we currently do not manufacture and market 
occasionally  we review such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed to make it attractive for us to reconsider manufacturing and selling 
if we decide to introduce one of these products into the consumer market  we must review the original anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of the applicable drug 
generally  in these situations  we file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
we would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for an anda supplement is similar to that of a new anda 
in addition to the efforts of our internal product development group  we have contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development  and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products include orally administered solid dosage products  injectables and nasal delivery products that are intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
we intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for some of these r d products to our own commercial manufacturing sites 
we initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of our own internal r d efforts 
the majority of our r d projects are being developed in house under our direct supervision and with our own personnel 
accordingly  we do not believe that our outside contracts for product development or manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor are we substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since we have no control over the fda review process  our management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
the following table summarizes key information related to our r d products 
the column headings are defined as follows stage of r d defines the current stage of the r d product in the development process  as of the date of this form k 
regulatory requirement defines whether the r d product is or is expected to be a new anda submission  an anda supplement  or a grand fathered product not requiring specific fda approval 
number of products defines the number of products in r d at the stage noted 
in this context  a product means any finished dosage form  including all potencies  containing the same api or combination of apis and which represents a generic version of the same reference listed drug rld or innovator drug  identified in the fda s orange book 
stage of r d regulatory requirement number of products fda review anda fda review anda supplement clinical testing anda scale up anda scale up anda supplement formulation method development anda we incurred r d expenses of approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the r d spending includes spending on bioequivalence studies  internal development resources as well as outsourced development 
while we manage all r d from our principal executive office in philadelphia  we have also been taking advantage of favorable development costs in other countries 
we have strategic partnerships with various companies that either act as 
table of contents contract research organizations or api suppliers as well as dosage form manufacturers 
in addition  us based research organizations have been engaged for product development to enhance our internal development 
fixed payment arrangements are established with lannett and these development partners  and can range up to million to develop a drug  and in some cases include a royalty provision 
development payments are normally scheduled in advance  based on attaining development milestones 
raw materials and finished goods inventory suppliers our use of raw materials in the production process consists of using pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms that are generally available from several sources 
fda approval is required in connection with the process of using most active ingredient suppliers 
in addition to the raw materials we purchase for the production process  we purchase certain finished dosage inventories  including capsule  tablet and oral liquid products 
we sell these finished dosage products directly to our customers along with the finished dosage products manufactured in house 
if suppliers of a certain material or finished product are limited  we will generally take certain precautionary steps to avoid a disruption in supply  such as finding a secondary supplier or ordering larger quantities 
our primary finished product inventory supplier is jsp in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods inventory from jsp accounted for approximately of our inventory purchases in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year on march   we entered into the jsp distribution agreement for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for million shares of our common stock 
the products covered under the jsp distribution agreement include butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levo tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid 
the initial term of the jsp distribution agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions and financial impact of the jsp distribution agreement 
during the term of the jsp distribution agreement  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products that we distribute 
the minimum quantity to be purchased in the first year of the jsp distribution agreement was million 
thereafter  the minimum purchase quantity increases by million per year up to million for the last year of the jsp distribution agreement 
we have met each applicable minimum purchase requirement to date  but there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
if we do not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the jsp distribution agreement 
we have entered into definitive supply and development agreements with certain international companies  including wintac of india  orion pharma of finland  azad pharma ag  swiss caps of switzerland  and pharma b formerly pharmaseed and the gc group of israel  as well as certain domestic companies  including jsp  banner pharmacaps  cerovene  and summit bioscience llc 
we are currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other international companies  through which we will market and distribute future products manufactured in house or by third parties 
we intend to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to build market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
customers and marketing we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  generic drug distributors  mail order pharmacies  group purchasing organizations  chain drug stores and other pharmaceutical companies 
the pharmaceutical industry s largest wholesale distributors  mckesson  cardinal health and amerisource bergen  accounted for   and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal year and  and  respectively  of our net sales in fiscal year our largest chain drug store customer  walgreens  accounted for and of net sales in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and have experienced no significant collection problems to date 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
sales to wholesale customers include indirect sales  which represent sales to third party entities  such as independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
we enter into definitive agreements with our indirect customers to establish pricing for certain covered products 
under such agreements  the indirect customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
we will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
for more information on chargebacks  see the section entitled chargebacks in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
these indirect sale transactions are recorded on our books as sales to the wholesale customers 
we promote our products through direct sales  trade shows and group purchasing organizations bidding processes 
we also market our products through private label arrangements  under which we manufacture our products with a label containing the name and logo of our customer 
this practice is commonly referred to as private label business 
private label business allows us to leverage our 
table of contents internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well respected pharmaceutical dosage suppliers 
the focus of our sales efforts is the relationships we create with our customer accounts 
strong and dependable customer relationships have created a positive platform for us to increase our sales volumes 
advertising in the generic pharmaceutical industry is generally limited to trade publications  read by retail pharmacists  wholesale purchasing agents and other pharmaceutical decision makers 
historically and in fiscal years  and  our advertising expenses were immaterial 
when our sales representatives make contact with a customer  we will generally offer to supply the customer our products at fixed prices 
if accepted  the customer s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase  receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets 
once a customer accepts our supply of a product  the customer typically expects a high standard of service  including timely receipt of products ordered  availability of convenient  user friendly and effective customer service functions and maintaining open lines of communication 
we believe that retail level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products 
in the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes  we believe that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply 
as a result  we attempt to develop and maintain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains  wholesale distributors and mail order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of our products through whatever channel the consumer prefers 
although we have agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of our sales  generally there are no minimum purchase quantities applicable to these agreements 
competition the manufacturing and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition to competitive pricing our competitive advantages are our ability to provide strong and dependable customer service by maintaining adequate inventory levels  employing a responsive order filling system and prioritizing timely fulfillment of orders 
we ensure that our products are available from national suppliers as well as our own warehouse 
the modernization of our facilities  hiring of experienced staff and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved our competitive cost position over the past five years 
we compete with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand name drugs 
each product manufactured and or sold by us has a different set of competitors 
the list below identifies the companies with which we primarily compete with respect to each of our major products

table of contents government regulation pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government  principally by the fda  and  in cases of controlled drugs the dea  and to a lesser extent by other federal regulatory bodies and state governments 
the fdca  the controlled substance act the csa and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  pricing  advertising  and promotion of our generic drug products 
noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  personal and or corporate prosecution and debarment  and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications 
the fda also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug products 
generally  fda approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed 
a new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use 
new drugs are typically developed and submitted to the fda by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it 
the fda review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate 
however  less burdensome approval procedures are generally used for generic equivalents 
typically  the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the innovator drug 
there are currently three ways to obtain fda approval of a drug new drug applications nda unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following sections is available  a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the fda complete clinical studies to establish a drug s safety and efficacy 
the new drug approval process generally involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the fda s glp regulations  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind application for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations  and submission to and approval by the fda of an nda 
the results of preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
further  each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
these phases generally include phase i  during which the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or  on occasion  patients and is tested for safety  stability  dose tolerance  and metabolism  phase ii  during which the drug is introduced into a limited patient population to determine the efficacy of the product in specific targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  and phase iii  during which the clinical trial is expanded to a larger and more diverse patient group at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy  optimal dosage  and safety 
the drug sponsor  the fda  or the independent institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies  together with other detailed information  are submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
the fda may approve or disapprove the nda if applicable fda regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional clinical data 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and 
table of contents post market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are identified after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post marketing studies 
the fda has broad post market regulatory and enforcement powers  including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties  suspend or delay issuance of approvals  seize or recall products  and withdraw approvals 
satisfaction of fda new drug approval requirements typically takes several years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity  and novelty of the product or disease 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon a manufacturer s activities 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be subject to varying interpretations that could delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approval 
even if a product receives regulatory approval  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
abbreviated new drug applications anda an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy 
however  it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect 
bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved 
the fda will approve the generic product as suitable for an anda application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product 
a product is not eligible for anda approval if the fda determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug  if it is intended for a different use  or if it is not subject to an approved suitability petition 
however  such a product might be approved under an nda  with supportive data from clinical trials 
in addition to establishing a new anda procedure  the hatch waxman act created statutory protections for approved brand name drugs 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid 
prior to this act  the fda gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug 
upon nda approval  the fda lists in its orange book the approved drug product and any patents identified by the nda applicant that relate to the drug product 
any applicant who files an anda seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the fda s orange book before expiration of the referenced patent s  must certify to the fda that no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the anda has been submitted to the fda  such patent has expired  the date on which such patent expires  or such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture  use  or sale of the drug product for which the anda is submitted 
this last certification is known as a paragraph iv certification 
a notice of the paragraph iv certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved nda to which the anda refers 
before the enactment of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the mma  which amended the hatch waxman act  if the nda holder or patent owner s asserted a patent challenge within days of its receipt of the certification notice  the fda was prevented from approving that anda until the earlier of months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph iv certification  the expiration of the patent  when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in an anda applicant s favor  or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court 
this prohibition is generally referred to as the month stay 
in some cases  nda owners and patent holders have obtained additional patents for their products after an anda had been filed but before that anda received final marketing approval  and then initiated a new patent challenge  which resulted in more than one month stay 
the mma amended the hatch waxman act to eliminate certain unfair advantages of patent holders in the implementation of the hatch waxman act 
as a result  the nda owner remains entitled to an automatic month stay if it initiates a patent infringement lawsuit within days of its receipt of notice of a paragraph iv certification  but only if the patent infringement lawsuit is directed to patents that were listed in the fda s orange book before the anda was filed 
an anda applicant is now permitted to take legal action to enjoin or prohibit the listing of certain of these patents as a counterclaim in response to a claim by the nda owner that its patent covers its approved drug product 
if an anda applicant is the first to file a substantially complete anda with a paragraph iv certification and provides appropriate notice to the fda  the nda holder  and all patent owner s for a particular generic product  the applicant may be awarded a day period of marketing exclusivity against other companies that subsequently file andas for that same product 
a substantially complete anda is one that contains all the information required by the hatch waxman act and the fda s regulations  including the results of any required bioequivalence studies 
the fda may refuse to accept the filing of an anda that is not substantially complete or may determine during substantive review of the anda that additional 
table of contents information  such as an additional bioequivalence study  is required to support approval 
such a determination may affect an applicant s first to file status and eligibility for a day period of marketing exclusivity for the generic product 
the mma also modified the rules governing when the day marketing exclusivity period is triggered or forfeited and shared 
prior to the legislation  the day marketing exclusivity period was triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda or a court decision holding the patent invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
for andas accepted for filing before march  that court decision had to be final and non appealable other than a petition to the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari 
in march  the fda changed its position in response to two court cases that challenged the fda s original interpretation of what constituted a court decision under the hatch waxman act 
under the changed policy  the day marketing exclusivity period began running immediately upon a district court decision holding the patent at issue invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed  regardless of whether the anda had been approved and the generic product had been marketed 
in codifying the fda s original policy  the mma retroactively applies a final and non appealable court decision trigger for all andas filed before december  leaving intact the first commercial marketing trigger 
as for andas filed after december   the marketing exclusivity period is only triggered upon the first commercial marketing of the anda product  but that exclusivity may be forfeited under certain circumstances  including  if the anda is not marketed within days after a final and non appealable court decision by the first to file or other anda applicant  or if the fda does not tentatively approve the first to file applicant s anda within months 
in addition to patent exclusivity  the holder of the nda for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non patent market exclusivity  during which the fda cannot approve an anda 
if the listed drug is a new chemical entity nce  the fda may not accept an anda for a bioequivalent product for up to five years following approval of the nda for the nce 
if the listed drug is not a new chemical entity but the holder of the nda conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the nda or a supplement thereto  the fda may not approve an anda for a bioequivalent product before expiration of three years 
certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the listed drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications 
section b new drug applications for a drug that is identical to a drug first approved after  a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full nda procedure 
instead  it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports where at least some of information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
the hatch waxman act permits the applicant to rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product 
the manufacturer must also submit  if the fda so requires  bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects  within an acceptable range  as the previously approved innovator drug 
because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post drugs may not be available  this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an anda drug would be unless bioeqivalency testing were undertaken and approved by fda 
moreover  the utility of section b applications have with the exception of grandfathered drugs been diminished by the availability of the anda process  as described above 
additionally  certain products  marketed prior to the fdca may be considered grase generally recognized as safe and effective or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfather clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
please see additional discussion regarding grase and grandfathered products in item a 
risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing cgmp requirements among the requirements for new drug approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s methods conform to the fda s cgmp regulations to the satisfaction of the fda pursuant to a pre approval inspection before the facility may be used to manufacture the product 
the cgmp regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured and the manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and other authorities 
these inspections include reviews of procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess compliance with application regulations 
fda s cgmp regulations require among other things  quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
in complying with the standards set forth in the cgmp regulations  we must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 

table of contents failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  including but not limited to  the seizure or recall of non complying drug products  injunctions  consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations  and or civil and criminal penalties 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval 
other regulatory requirements with respect to post market product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the fdca  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and or federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices  the experimental use of animals  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research 
in each of these areas  as above  the fda has broad regulatory and enforcement powers  including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties  suspend or delay issuance of approvals  seize or recall products  and withdraw approvals 
any one or combination of fda regulatory or enforcement actions against the company could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
outside of the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing marketing authorization  pricing  and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within the european union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of safety  quality and efficacy 
dea regulation we maintain registrations with the dea that enable us to receive  manufacture  store  and distribute controlled substances in connection with our operations 
controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the dea under the csa 
the csa governs  among other things  the distribution  recordkeeping  handling  security  and disposal of controlled substances 
we are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the dea and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess our ongoing compliance with the dea s regulations 
any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions  including the revocation or a denial of renewal of our dea registration  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
fraud and abuse laws because of the significant federal funding involved in medicare and medicaid  congress and the states have enacted  and actively enforce  a number of laws whose purpose is to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs 
our business is subject to compliance with these laws  such as sarbanes oxley act of  dodd frank  and the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
anti kickback statutes and federal false claims act the federal health care programs anti kickback statutes prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  offering  receiving  or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as medicare or medicaid 
the definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value  including for example gifts  certain discounts  the furnishing of free supplies  equipment or services  credit arrangements  payment of cash and waivers of payments 
several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business  the statute has been violated 
penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines  imprisonment  and possible exclusion from medicare  medicaid  and other federal health care programs 
in addition some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the federal false claims act  discussed in more detail below 

table of contents the anti kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry 
recognizing that the anti kickback statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements  congress authorized the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services oig to issue a series of regulations  known as safe harbors 
these safe harbors  issued by the oig beginning in july  set forth provisions that  if all their applicable requirements are met  will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the anti kickback statute 
the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued 
however  conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as oig 
many states have adopted laws similar to the anti kickback statute 
some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source  not only the medicare and medicaid programs 
government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on marketing of health care services and products  among other activities  and recently have brought cases against companies  and certain sales  marketing  and executive personnel  for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business 
another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal civil false claims act ffca  and in particular  action brought pursuant to the ffca s whistleblower or qui tam provisions 
the ffca imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program 
the qui tam provisions of the ffca allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government  and to share in any monetary recovery 
in recent years  the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically 
in addition  various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the ffca  although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third party payor and not merely a federal health care program 
when an entity is determined to have violated the ffca  it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus civil penalties of  to  for each separate false claim 
there are many potential bases for liability under the ffca 
liability arises  primarily  when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the federal government has used the ffca to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care  kickbacks  and other improper referrals  and improper use of medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services  in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered 
in addition  the federal government has prosecuted companies under the ffca in connection with off label promotion of products 
our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products  the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal  state  and third party reimbursement of our products  and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws 
we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the ffca or a similar state law  or the impact of such actions 
however  the costs of defending such claims  as well as any sanctions imposed  could significantly affect our financial performance 
foreign corrupt practices act the foreign corrupt practices act of  as amended fcpa  was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business 
specifically  the anti bribery provisions of the fcpa prohibit the bribery of government officials 
lannett believes it is in compliance with the fcpa 
hipaa and other fraud and privacy regulations among other things  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the hipaa health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowing and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payors 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment  and or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the hipaa false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing  or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious  or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items  or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 

table of contents pricing in the united states  our sales are dependent upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement for our products from third party payers  including federal and state programs such as medicare and medicaid  and private organizations such as commercial health insurance and managed care companies 
such third party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services and instituting cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services 
this includes the placement of our pharmaceutical products on drug formularies or lists of medications 
over the past several years  the rising costs of providing health care services has triggered legislation to make certain changes to the way in which pharmaceuticals  including our products  are covered and reimbursed  particularly by governmental programs 
for instance  recent federal legislation and regulations have created a voluntary prescription drug benefit  medicare part d  revised the formula used to reimburse health care providers and physicians under part b and imposed significant revisions to the medicaid drug rebate program 
these changes have resulted in  and may continue to result in  coverage and reimbursement restrictions and increased rebate obligations by manufacturers 
in addition  there continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care 
examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the united states may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include changing medicare reimbursement methodologies  revising drug rebate calculations under the medicaid program  reforming drug importation laws  fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies  and requiring pre approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies 
we cannot predict the likelihood or pace of such additional changes or whether there will be significant legislative or regulatory reform impacting our products  nor can we predict with precision what effect such governmental measures would have if they were ultimately enacted into law 
however  in general  we believe that legislative and regulatory reform activity likely will continue 
we are also subject to federal  state and local laws of general applicability  including laws regulating working conditions and the storage  transportation  or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances  hazardous waste  or environmental contaminants 
we monitor our compliance with all environmental laws 
we are in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies 
as a publicly traded company  we are also subject to significant regulations and laws  including the sarbanes oxley act of since its enactment  we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices and we continue to update the program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and are responsible for maintaining compliance with many regulatory requirements 
the us department of justice  acting on behalf of the dea  issued us a letter in august requesting additional information on certain record keeping matters regarding a dea inspection of our facilities 
we fully complied with their request and intend to fully comply with all requests for information that occur from time to time as a normal course of business

risk factors a major portion of our revenue is derived from sales of finished products manufactured by jerome stevens pharmaceuticals jsp 
if our contract with jsp is not renegotiated prior to its march  expiration date  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
approximately of our fiscal year net sales are of distributed products  primarily manufactured by jsp 
two of these products are levo and digoxin  which accounted for and  respectively  of our fiscal net sales  and and  respectively  of our net sales for fiscal our agreement with jsp currently expires on march  the company is currently engaged in discussions to renew the contract  however there is no guarantee that the contract will be renewed or extended 
if the company fails to renegotiate the agreement with jsp or it renews its contract with jsp with terms less favorable than those included in the existing agreement  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we materially rely on an uninterrupted supply of finished products from jsp for a majority of our sales 
if we were to experience an interruption of that supply  our operating results would suffer 
if the supply of these products is interrupted in any way by any form of temporary or permanent business interruption to jsp  including but not limited to fire or other naturally occurring  damaging event to their physical plant and or equipment  condemnation of their facility  legislative or regulatory cease and desist declaration regarding their operations  fda action  and any interruption in their source of api for their products  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we do not have  at this time  a second source for these products 
the generic pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
we face strong competition in our generic product business 
revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire or fall under patent challenges  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration 
as competing off patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products for which no separate regulatory approval is required  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins 
during the first quarter of fiscal  lannett faced significant pricing challenges on its top two selling products 
in order to keep the volume of business with the specific customer involved  lannett chose to reduce its selling price on both of the products 
this price reduction has had and may continue to have a significant impact to the gross profit margins and profitability of lannett in the future 
extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  including lannett  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  including the fda and in the case of controlled drugs  the dea  and state government agencies 
the fdca  the csa and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacturing  packing  labeling  storing  record keeping  safety  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
the process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments 
we are dependent on receiving fda and other governmental or third party approvals prior to manufacturing  marketing and shipping our products 
the fda approval process for a particular product candidate can take several years and requires us to dedicate substantial resources to securing approvals  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in a timely manner  or at all 
in order to obtain approval for our generic product candidates  we must demonstrate that our drug product is bioequivalent to a drug previously approved by the fda through the new drug approval process  known as an innovator drug 
bioequivalency may be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro by comparing the generic product candidate to the innovator drug product in dosage form  strength  route of administration  quality  dissolution performance characteristics  and intended use 
the fda may not agree that the bioequivalence studies we submit in the anda applications for our generic drug products are adequate to support approval 
if it determines that an anda application is not adequate to support approval  the fda could deny our application or request additional 
table of contents information  including clinical trials  which could delay approval of the product and impair our ability to compete with other versions of the generic drug product 
consequently  there is always the chance that we will not obtain fda or other necessary approvals  or that the rate  timing and cost of such approvals  will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations 
we carry inventories of certain product s in anticipation of launch  and if such product s are not subsequently launched  we may be required to write off the related inventory 
furthermore  the fda also has the authority to revoke drug approvals previously granted and remove these products from the market for a variety of reasons  including a failure to comply with applicable regulations  the discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  or because the ingredients in the drug are no longer approved by the fda 
additionally  certain products  marketed prior to the fdca may be considered grase or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act  act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfathered drug clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
recently  the fda has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek fda approval for grase or grandfathered products 
efforts have included issuing notices to companies currently producing these products to cease its distribution of said products 
lannett currently manufactures and markets two products that are considered grase or grandfathered products  including c topical solution and oxycodone hcl solution 
the fda is currently undertaking activities to force all companies who manufacture certain grase products to file applications and seek approval for these products or remove their products from the market 
as of july   lannett stopped manufacturing and distributing morphine sulfate oral solution ms as part of one the fda s enforcement actions 
lannett filed a b new drug application ms nda in february and was granted fda approval on the submission in june due to the length of time it took to receive approval on this application  the company fully reserved its ms inventory as of june  the company submitted  as part of the ms nda  a million application fee at the time of submission 
lannett is currently working with the fda to get part of this fee returned to the company 
as of june   the company has not received a final determination on whether any of the fee is refundable 
an estimate of the un returned amount was reclassified from other long term assets on the company s balance sheet as of june  into intangible assets upon shipment of the product which commenced in august the company began amortizing the intangible asset over its useful life upon shipment of the product in august amortization will be adjusted prospectively once the un returned amount is finalized 
lannett also has approximately million of net inventory value at june  of other grandfathered products which would also be at risk if the fda were to pursue enforcement actions on these products similar to their actions on morphine sulfate oral solution and oxycodone hcl oral solution 
in addition  lannett  as well as many of our significant suppliers of distributed product and raw materials  are subject to periodic inspection of facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of the finished products by the fda  the dea and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that pharmaceutical companies are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether systems and processes are in compliance with cgmp  and other fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form that could cause us or our suppliers to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
the dea and comparable state level agencies also heavily regulate the manufacturing  holding  processing  security  record keeping  and distribution of drugs that are considered controlled substances 
some of the pain management products we manufacture contain controlled substances 
the dea periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations 
if our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  it could result in regulatory action and additional costs 
our inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  delays in or denials of new product approvals  warning letters  fines  consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of sales  and or criminal prosecution 
any of these or other regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
although we have instituted internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
additionally  if the fda were to undertake additional enforcement activities with any of lannett s grase products  their actions could result in  among other things  removal of some of our products from the market  seizure of products and total or partial suspension of sales 
any of these regulatory actions could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our manufacturing operations as well as our suppliers manufacturing are subject to licensing by the fda and or dea 
if we or our suppliers are unable to maintain the proper agency licensing arrangements  our operating results would be materially negatively impacted 
all of our manufacturing operations as well as those of our suppliers rely on maintaining active licenses to produce and develop generic drugs 
specifically  our cody labs operations rely on a dea license to directly import and convert raw concentrated poppy straw into several apis or dosage forms 
this license is granted for a one year period and must be renewed successfully each year in order for us to maintain cody s current operations and allow the company to continue to work towards becoming a fully integrated narcotics supplier 
if the company is unable to successfully renew its fda and or dea licenses  the financial results of lannett would be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner  receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability  on commercially reasonable terms  of raw materials  including apis and other key ingredients  developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming  costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products  and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the fda of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of the off patent product by up to months  and in some cases  such patents have been issued and listed with the fda after the key chemical patent on the branded drug product has expired or been litigated  causing additional delays in obtaining approval 
as a result of these and other difficulties  products currently in development by lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing 
if any of our products  when developed and approved  cannot be successfully or timely commercialized  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 
the loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of our key personnel 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if they are unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason  our business may be significantly impaired 
if the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers in order to help retain these key individuals 
our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix  our product pricing and our costs to manufacture or purchase products 
our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix 
our sales of certain products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than do the products we purchase and resell 
as a result  our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period 
factors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the amount of new product introductions  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  
table of contents the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers  and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs  which could have an impact on products that we are developing 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means  our sales may decline 
if we experience a material decline in product sales  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will suffer 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
this is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the branded product is expiring  an area where infringement litigation is prevalent  and in the case of new branded products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  if we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials  our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded 
we are required to identify the supplier s of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the fda 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application 
however  some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and  in some of our drug applications  only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified  even in instances where multiple sources exist 
to the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time  and at reasonable cost  or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the fda  our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease  and our development and sales and marketing efforts could be delayed 

table of contents our policies regarding returns  allowances and chargebacks  and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post sale inventory allowances 
under these arrangements  from time to time  we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing 
therefore  if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products  we would likely reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals  group purchasing organizations  pharmacies or other customers 
a chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler s end customer pays for a product 
although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates 
health care initiatives and other third party payor cost containment pressures could cause us to sell our products at lower prices  resulting in decreased revenues 
some of our products are purchased or reimbursed by state and federal government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and managed care organizations  or mcos 
third party payors increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing 
there also continues to be a trend toward managed health care in the united states 
pricing pressures by third party payors and the growth of organizations such as hmos and mcos could result in lower prices and a reduction in demand for our products 
in addition  legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care and government insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which pharmaceutical products and medical devices are prescribed and purchased 
we expect there will continue to be federal and state laws and or regulations  proposed and implemented  that could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services 
the extent to which future legislation or regulations  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain 
for example  the american recovery and reinstatement act of  also known as the stimulus package  includes billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies 
the stimulus package funding is expected to be used for  among other things  to conduct  support or synthesize research that compares and evaluates the risk and benefits  clinical outcomes  effectiveness and appropriateness of products 
although congress has indicated that this funding is intended for improvement in quality of health care  it remains unclear how the research will impact coverage  reimbursement or other third party payor policies 
such measures or other health care system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability 
we may need to change our business practices to comply with changes to fraud and abuse laws 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including the federal fraud and abuse law sometimes referred to as the anti kickback statute which apply to our sales and marketing practices and our relationships with physicians 
at the federal level  the anti kickback statute prohibits any person or entity from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering  or paying any remuneration  including a bribe  kickback  or rebate  directly or indirectly  in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by federal health care programs  or the furnishing  recommending  or arranging for products or services covered by federal health care programs 
federal health care programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide health benefits funded by the federal government  including medicare and medicaid  among others 
the definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value  including  for example  gifts  discounts  the furnishing of supplies or equipment  credit arrangements  payments of cash  and waivers of payments 
several courts have interpreted the federal anti kickback statute s intent requirement to mean that if even one purpose in an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal health care programs  the statute has been violated 
the federal government has issued regulations  commonly known as safe harbors that set forth certain provisions which  if fully met  will assure parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal anti kickback statute 
the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement will be illegal or that prosecution under the federal anti kickback statute will be pursued  but such transactions or arrangements face an increased risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and an ongoing risk of prosecution 
if our sales and marketing practices or our relationships with physicians such as physicians serving on our scientific advisory board are considered by federal or state enforcement authorities to be knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering  or providing any remuneration in exchange for arranging for or recommending our products and services  and such activities do not fit within a safe harbor  then these arrangements could be challenged under the federal anti kickback statute 
if our operations are found to be in 
table of contents violation of the federal anti kickback statute we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties including fines of up to  per violation  civil monetary penalties of up to  per violation  assessments of up to three times the amount of the prohibited remuneration  imprisonment  and exclusion from participating in the federal health care programs 
in addition  hipaa and its implementing regulations created two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the hipaa health care fraud statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing  or attempting to execute  a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payors 
a violation of this statue is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment and or exclusion from government sponsored programs 
the hipaa false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items  or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
a number of states also have anti fraud and anti kickback laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute that prohibit certain direct or indirect payments if such arrangements are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients or the furnishing of goods or services 
some states anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply only to goods and services covered by medicaid 
other states anti fraud and anti kickback laws apply to all health care goods and services  regardless of whether the source of payment is governmental or private 
due to the breadth of these laws and the potential for changes in laws  regulations  or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could materially adversely affect our business 
certain federal and state governmental agencies  including the us department of justice and the us department of health and human services  have been investigating issues surrounding pricing information reported by drug manufacturers and used in the calculation of reimbursements as well as sales and marketing practices 
for example  many government and third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain pharmaceutical products based on the product s awp reported by pharmaceutical companies 
while lannett has only used suggested wholesale prices since  the federal government  certain state agencies  and private payors are investigating and have begun to file court actions related to pharmaceutical companies reporting practices with respect to awp  alleging that the practice of reporting prices for pharmaceutical products has resulted in a false and overstated awp  which in turn is alleged to have improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by medicare beneficiaries  insurers  state medicaid programs  medical plans  and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products 
in addition  some of these same payors are also alleging that companies are not reporting their best price to the states under the medicaid program 
we are not currently subject to any such investigations or actions and having not used awp pricing since would not likely become subject to these investigations 
we may become subject to federal and state false claims litigation brought by private individuals and the government 
we are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement 
the federal false claims act ffca  also known as qui tam  imposes civil liability and criminal fines on individuals or entities that knowingly submit  or cause to be submitted  false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government 
violations of the ffca and other similar laws may result in criminal fines  imprisonment  and civil penalties for each false claim submitted and exclusion from federally funded health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the ffca also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the ffca 
these suits  also known as qui tam actions  may be brought by  with only a few exceptions  any private citizen who has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed 
these suits have increased significantly in recent years because the ffca allows an individual to share in any amounts paid to the federal government in fines or settlement as a result of a successful qui tam action 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from federal health care programs  and or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties  damages  fines  curtailment  or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results  action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against them  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market  and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including lannett 

table of contents our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june   and  and  respectively  of our net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the loss of any of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows 
in addition  the company generally does not enter into long term supply agreements with its customers that would require them to purchase our products 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties  and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against lannett  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
rising insurance costs  as well as the inability to obtain certain insurance coverage for risks faced by lannett  could negatively impact profitability 
the cost of insurance  including workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance  has risen in prior years and may increase in the future 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverage to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverage  could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  certain insurance coverages may not be available to lannett for risks faced by lannett 
sometimes the coverages obtained by lannett for certain risks may not be adequate to fully reimburse the amount of damage that lannett could possibly sustain 
should either of these events occur  the lack of insurance to cover the entire cost to the company would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
significant balances of intangible assets  including product rights acquired  are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquired contractual rights to market and distribute products are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization and related impairment charges identified to date 
we determined the initial cost by referring to the original fair value of the assets exchanged 
future amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an additional impairment test on the affected asset and  if evidence of impairment exists  we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset 
such a charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this new requirement and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain  and could adversely affect our business

accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as rebates  chargebacks and returns payable and reductions to net sales 
the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments may not be proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in both the product and the customer mix 
increased sales to wholesalers will generally require additional accruals as they are the primary recipient of chargebacks and rebates 
incentives offered to secure sales vary from product to product 
provisions for estimated rebates and promotional credits are estimated based upon contractual terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns  and chargebacks  require management to make subjective judgments on customer mix 
unlike branded innovator drug companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims and wolters kluwer  in estimating future returns and other credits 
lannett calculates a chargeback rebate rate based on contractual terms with its customers and applies this rate to customer sales 
the only variable is customer mix  and this assumption is based on historical data and sales expectations 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix and the amount of those sales that end up at indirect customers with which the company has specific chargeback agreements 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks on actual sales may differ from actual chargeback reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key chain drug store  distributor and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca enacted in the us in march  the company participates in a new cost sharing program for certain medicare part d beneficiaries designed primarily for the sale of brand drugs and certain generic drugs if their fda approval was granted under a new drug application nda or b nda versus an abbreviated new drug application anda 
because our drugs used for the treatment of thyroid deficiency and our morphine sulfate oral solution product were approved by the fda as a b nda  they are considered branded drugs for purposes of the ppaca 
drugs purchased under this program during medicare part d coverage gap commonly referred to as the donut hole result in additional rebates 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase 
however  since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers  the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of customers that are eligible to receive rebates 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices  and credit terms 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors the provisions for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
the reserve for returns is included in the rebates  chargebacks and returns payable account on the balance sheet 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive 
table of contents market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated declines in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments are included in the rebates  chargebacks and returns payable account on the balance sheet 
the following tables identify the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity for fiscal years  and unless we have specific information to indicate otherwise  actual credits issued in a given year are assumed to be related to sales recorded in prior years based on the company s returns policy

the total reserve for chargebacks  rebates  returns and other adjustments increased from  at june  to  june  the increase in total reserves was due to an increase in the rebates reserve as a result of increased gross sales to customers who participate in rebate programs  the timing of actual rebate credits issued  as well as an additional rebate program the company became obligated to participate in under medicare part d 
the increase in chargeback reserves is due primarily to an increase in inventory levels at wholesale distribution centers as a result of increased gross sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal the activity in the other category for the year ended june  includes shelf stock  shipping and other sales adjustments 
the following tables compare the year end reserve balances in fiscal years and and the gross sales mix in fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended june  in thousands chargeback reserve rebate reserve return reserve other reserve fiscal year ended june  chain drug stores mail order wholesalers reserve activity vs 
the total reserve for chargebacks  rebates  returns and other adjustments decreased from  at june  to  at june  the decrease in total reserves was due to a decrease in the rebates reserve as a result of the timing of credits being processed by the customers and by the company  a decrease in chargeback reserves due primarily to a decrease in inventory levels at wholesale distribution centers  and a decrease in return reserve primarily due to timing of credits processed by the customer 

table of contents during fiscal  the company issued credits totaling  related to fiscal gross sales of morphine sulfate oral solution which were returned as a result of the fda s action to force the company to cease manufacturing and distributing this product as of july  the following tables compare the year end reserve balances in fiscal years and and the gross sales mix in fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended june  in thousands chargeback reserve rebate reserve return reserve other reserve fiscal year ended june  chain drug stores mail order wholesalers inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market  regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand  and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by presently enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense benefit is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the authoritative standards issued by the fasb also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of its net deferred tax assets are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset is greater than fair value 
the fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
definite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the undiscounted cash flows related to the assets 
our cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions which are considered level inputs  including estimates of future cash flow including long term growth rates  discount rates  and expectations about variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows 
as of june  and  the company had one indefinite lived intangible asset in the amount of  the company performed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment charges were required 
no events or changes in circumstances were identified during fiscal or fiscal that would indicate a need to perform impairment analyses for definite lived intangible assets 
as such  no impairment charges were required 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from to years 
the company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  the company incurred amortization expense of   and  respectively 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation costs are recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant less an estimate for forfeitures 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and the share price on the grant date to value restricted stock 
the fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life of the awards  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions which are generally outside the company s control 
changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on share based compensation costs recognized in the financial statements 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our black scholes weighted average assumptions for fiscal   and new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this authoritative guidance must be applied retrospectively  and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued an update deferring the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this guidance by the company on july  will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as it only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance

if either party were to terminate the purchase agreement  there would be a significant impact on the operating cash flows of the company from the termination 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions and financial impact of the jsp distribution agreement 
prospects for the future generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are constantly faced with pricing pressures in the marketplace as competitors attempt to lure business from distributors  wholesalers and chain retailers by offering lower prices than the incumbent supplier 
lannett tries to differentiate itself in the marketplace by complementing its lower cost offerings with higher levels of customer service and quality of the products 
but as lannett enters fiscal year  there is an increasing number of competitors on our key products that are attempting to supplant lannett as the preferred vendor 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  lannett faced significant pricing challenges on its top two selling products 
in order to keep the volume of business with the specific customers involved  lannett chose to reduce its selling price on both of the products 
these price reductions had and may continue to have a significant impact to the gross profit margins and profitability of lannett expected in the future 
the company has had difficulty marketing its oxycodone hcl solution product starting in the third quarter of fiscal due to the current limitations by the dea to grant additional manufacturing quota to cody labs for its production 
this product contributed approximately million in revenue in fiscal and million in fiscal the loss of this product would have a significant impact to the gross profit margins and profitability of lannett expected in the future 
the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered  topical  injectable and parenteral products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
as one of the oldest generic drug manufacturers in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  or the raw material supplier of the previously approved anda 
recently  the fda has announced that it will prioritize its review of  chemistry manufacturing and control cmc supplements in order to make progress on reviewing a backlog of over  andas 
this could negatively impact the sales of future products 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies and on average can range from million to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
the company views its april acquisition of cody laboratories  inc cody labs or cody as an important step in becoming a vertically integrated narcotics manufacturer and distributor by allowing it to concentrate on developing and completing its dosage 
table of contents form manufacturing in order to reduce narcotic api costs 
in july  the dea granted cody labs a license to directly import raw poppy straw for conversion into api and or various pharmaceutical products 
only six other companies in the us have been granted this license to date 
this license allows the company to avoid increased costs associated with buying narcotic api from other manufacturers 
the company anticipates that it can use this license to become a vertically integrated manufacturer of narcotic products  as well as a supplier of api to the pharmaceutical industry 
the company believes that the aging domestic population may result in a higher demand for pain management pharmaceutical products and that it will be well positioned to take advantage of this increased demand 
cody labs manufacturing expertise in narcotic apis will allow lannett to build a market with limited domestic competition 
the company anticipates that the demand for narcotics and controlled drugs will continue to grow as the baby boomer generation ages and that it is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities by concentrating additional resources in the narcotics and controlled drugs area 
the sale of pain management products approximated of net sales for the year fiscal and of net sales for the fiscal due to the fda s actions against morphine sulfate oral solution and a slow down in the demand for one other product that is manufactured at cody  lannett incurred a decrease in the percentage of sales related to pain management products during fiscal since the company received the fda approval for its b new drug application for morphine sulfate oral solution in june  net sales related to pain management products have increased 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products  topical  injectable or parenterals intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
we intend to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for most of these r d products to our own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
occasionally  the company will work on developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
certain prescription drugs do not require prior fda approval before marketing 
they include  for instance  drugs listed as desi drugs drug efficacy study implementation which are under evaluation by fda  grandfathered drugs  and prescription multivitamin drugs 
a generic manufacturer may sell products which are chemically equivalent to innovator drugs  under fda rules by simply performing and internally documenting the normal research and development involved in bringing a new product to market 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time required for fda approval 
more specifically  certain products  marketed prior to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act may be considered grase or grandfathered 
grase products are those old drugs that do not require prior approval from fda in order to be marketed because they are generally recognized as safe and effective based on published scientific literature 
similarly  grandfathered products are those which entered the market before the passage of the act or the amendments to the act 
under the grandfather clause  such a product is exempted from the effectiveness requirements 
of the act 
if its composition and labeling have not changed since and if  on the day before the amendments became effective  it was used or sold commercially in the united states  not a new drug as defined by the act at that time  and not covered by an effective application 
recently  the fda has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek fda approval for these grase products 
efforts have included granting market exclusivity to approved grase products and issuing notices to companies currently producing these products 
the company has entered supply and development agreements with certain international companies  including wintac of india  orion pharma of finland  azad pharma ag and swiss caps of switzerland  pharma b formerly pharmaseed of israel and the gc group  as well as certain domestic companies  including jsp  banner pharmacaps  cerovene and summit bioscience 
the company is currently in negotiations on similar agreements with other international companies  through which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by lannett or by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development and manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
lannett may increase its focus on certain specialty markets in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
such a focus is intended to provide lannett customers with increased product alternatives in categories with relatively few market participants 
while there is no guarantee that lannett has the market expertise or financial resources necessary to succeed in such a market specialty  management is confident that such future focus will be well received by lannett customers and increase shareholder value in the long run 

table of contents the company plans to enhance relationships with strategic business partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as finished goods 
management believes that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could allow for potential competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
the company plans to continue to explore such areas for potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value
