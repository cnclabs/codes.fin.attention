item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview and outlook we are headquartered in irvine  california and develop  manufacture  market and sell innovative medical devices for the 
table of contents treatment of aortic disorders 
our principal product is a stent graft and delivery catheter for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms through minimally invasive endovascular repair 
we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and in september  we began direct sales activity throughout much of western europe 
in certain european countries  and in other parts of the world  our products are sold through third party distributors 
in  we will continue to execute our mission of being the leading innovator of medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders  by focusing exclusively on the aorta for the commercialization of innovative medical devices 
designing and manufacturing devices that are easy to use and result in excellent clinical outcomes 
providing excellent clinical and technical support to physicians through an experienced and knowledgeable sales and marketing organization 
clinical trials and product developments overview we spent million in  million in  and million in  on research and development and clinical studies 
our focus is to continually develop innovative and cost effective medical device technology for the treatment of aortic disorders 
we believe that our ability to develop new technologies is a key to our future growth and success 
our research and development activities have focused on technology that makes our existing products easier to use  have the ability to treat more aaa patients  and that can address aortic disorders beyond aaa 
historically  we have focused on developing elg systems to treat infrarenal below the renal arteries aaa 
however  we expect to devote more resources in the future to develop new technologies to treat juxtarenal at or above the renal arteries and thoracic chest aneurysms and dissections of the aorta 
refer to item i  clinical trials and product developments  for a discussion regarding our ongoing clinical trials and product development projects 
characteristics of our revenue and expenses revenue revenue is derived from sales of our elg system including extensions and accessories to hospitals upon completion of an evar procedure  or from sales to distributors upon shipment of our elg system  provided our other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes compensation including stock based compensation and benefits of production personnel and production support personnel 
cost of goods sold also includes depreciation expense for production equipment  production materials and supplies expense  allocated facilities related expenses  and certain direct costs such as shipping 
research and development research and development expenses consist of compensation including stock based compensation and benefits for research and development personnel  materials and supplies  research and development consultants  and allocated facilities related costs 
our research and development activities primarily relate to the development and testing of new devices and methods to treat aortic disorders 
clinical and regulatory clinical and regulatory expenses consist of compensation including stock based compensation and benefits for clinical and regulatory personnel  regulatory and clinical payments related to studies  and allocated facilities related costs 
our clinical and regulatory activities primarily relate to studies in order to gain regulatory approval for the commercialization of our devices 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of the compensation including stock based compensation and benefits of our sales force  sales support  and marketing personnel 
it also includes costs attributable to marketing our products to our customers and prospective customers 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses primarily include compensation including stock based compensation and benefits for personnel that support our general operations such as information technology  executive management  financial accounting  customer services  and human resources 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense  patent and legal fees  financial audit fees  insurance  recruiting  other professional services  and allocated facilities related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews our significant accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following revenue recognition and accounts receivable inventory lower of cost or market goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis income taxes stock based compensation contingent consideration for business acquisition revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have appropriate evidence of a binding arrangement with our customer  the sales price for our elg system including extensions and accessories is established with our customer  our elg system has been used in an evar procedure  or shipped to a distributor  as applicable  and our collection of the relevant receivable is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
for sales made to a direct customer ie hospitals  we recognize revenue upon completion of an evar procedure  when our elg device is implanted in a patient 
for sales to distributors  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of our elg system to a distributor 
we do not offer rights of return and we have no post delivery obligations  other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
inventory lower of cost or market we adjust our inventory value for estimated amounts of obsolete or unmarketable items 
such assumptions involve projections of future customer demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
in determining the value of ipr d  we used the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method reflects the present 
table of contents value of the operating cash flows generated by the ipr d  after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with the invested capital 
the key drivers  which require significant judgment  are projected revenue and earnings generated by the project  estimated timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  the expected life of the asset  the contributory asset charges that would be paid to the requisite operating assets  and a discount rate that reflects the level of the risk associated with receiving future cash flows 
in the judgment of management  the value of the nellix ipr d was million at the time of the acquisition 
as of the time of acquisition  we expected that all acquired ipr d will reach technological feasibility  but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability will actually be achieved 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  delay or failure to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials  failure of clinical trials  delay or failure to obtain required market clearances  and patent litigation 
if commercial viability is not achieved  we will not realize the original estimated financial benefits 
income taxes our consolidated balance sheets reflect net deferred tax assets that primarily represent the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items  net of a valuation allowance 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized 
each quarter  we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our evaluation considers historical earnings  estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
adjustments to the valuation allowance increase or decrease net income or loss in the period such adjustments are made 
if our estimates require adjustments  it could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if it is more likely than not that we would not realize the deferred tax benefits  then all or a portion of the valuation allowance may need to be re established 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense over a stock option award vesting period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and the option s expected life 
the financial statements include such amounts based on our best estimates and judgments 
we amortize restricted stock grants on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant 
a portion of restricted stock vesting is dependent on us achieving certain regulatory and financial milestones 
we use significant judgment in estimating the likelihood and timing of achieving these milestones 
each period  we will reassess the likelihood and estimate the timing of reaching these milestones  and will adjust expense accordingly 
contingent consideration for business acquisition we determine the fair value of contingently issuable common stock related to the nellix acquisition using a probability based income approach using an appropriate discount rate 
changes in the fair value of the contingently issuable common stock are determined each period end and recorded in the other income expense section of the consolidated statements of operations and the non current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet

beginning in september  we transitioned from a third party distributor to our own direct sales organization in europe 
from january  through august  and all prior periods  our european sales were solely derived from independent distributors 
from september  through december   our european sales were derived from i our developing direct european sales force serving the markets of austria  belgium  the czech republic  denmark  france  germany  luxemburg  the netherlands  romania  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom excluding northern ireland  and ii four independent distributors serving the markets in italy  greece  turkey  and ireland

the million increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by the development activities related to the nellix device  which represented an increase of million of total research and development expenses for the twelve months ended december  in addition  research and development activities associated with the afx increased by million  as we prepared for its launch in august the remaining increase in research and development  as compared to  is related to services and materials for general research and development activities for our other projects  including ventana 
clinical and regulatory affairs 
the million increase in clinical affairs expenses is primarily driven by the continued enrollment and follow up costs associated with our pevar clinical trial 
marketing and sales 
the million increase in marketing and sales expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to was primarily related to additional sales personnel related costs 
we experienced an increase in variable compensation expense associated with our increase in us revenue for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the prior year 
additionally  with the recent hiring of sales representatives and clinical specialists  our average number of sales representatives and clinical specialists active in increased by and respectively  compared to we also had an increase in marketing costs associated with driving us sales growth  and incurred million of incremental expenses in to build our direct sales force in europe

these increases were partially offset by million of nellix acquisition costs that only arose in the prior year 
distribution contract termination 
upon mutual agreement  we terminated a european distribution agreement  effective september  in connection therewith  we were contractually required to pay this distributor million in order to start directly marketing and selling our products within certain western european countries 
additionally  upon mutual agreement  we early terminated a distribution agreement with an italian distributor  effective march  we were contractually required to pay this distributor million as part of the transfer of distribution rights to another italian distributor 
year ended december  versus december  revenue 
table of contents years ended december  variance percent change in thousands revenue sales increased to million in from million in us sales increased from million to million 
the increase in us sales was primarily due to the increased size and effectiveness of our sales force 
sales to distributors outside the us increased from million in to million in this increase was driven primarily by the release of intuitrak and its rapid acceptance by the customers of most of our international distributors 
cost of goods sold  gross profit  and gross margin percentage years ended december  variance percent change in thousands cost of goods sold gross profit gross margin percentage gross profit as a percent of revenue cost of goods sold increased from million in to million in  due to a increase in revenue  as discussed above 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher sales volumes in as compared to the gross margin increase in was due to a more favorable product mix  volume related efficiencies  and our cost effective transition to in house eptfe graft material processing for intuitrak 
operating expenses years ended december  variance percent change in thousands research and development clinical and regulatory affairs marketing and sales general and administrative research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from costs associated with enhancing and expanding our product line  along with incremental costs incurred in late as a result of our acquisition of the nellix technology 
clinical and regulatory affairs 
clinical and regulatory affairs expenses increased by to million from million in  primarily due to costs associated with our pevar clinical trial 
marketing and sales

c total current assets divided by total current liabilities 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in the prior year 
the increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily a function of increased research and development expenditures  increased expenditures to develop our european sales organization  and the increase in inventory purchases and production to support our revenue growth and afx launch 
our increased cash expenditures for inventory were partially offset by general improvements in our billing and collection processes  specifically within the area of monitoring and follow up of overdue accounts receivable balances from us customers 
for the years ended december  and  our cash collections from customers totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of revenue reported for the same periods 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million and primarily consisted of machinery and equipment used to produce our elg system  information technology enhancements  and leasehold improvements of our irvine facilities to support our business growth 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the million in cash provided by financing activities was attributable to million in proceeds from exercises of stock options and million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
credit arrangements in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo  which was last amended on february   whereby we may borrow up to million  subject to the calculation of a borrowing base wells credit facility 
all amounts owing under the wells credit facility will become due and payable upon its expiration on march  all outstanding amounts under the wells credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the wells prime rate  plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion of the wells credit facility is subject to an unused revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly in arrears  in an amount equal to per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line 
the wells credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business  as well as certain financial and negative covenants 
the wells credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets  except our intellectual property 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the wells credit facility  though as of that date we were bound by our then existing financial covenant requiring us to not exceed a net loss excluding non cash contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of nellix of million for the year ending december  net loss covenant 
we calculated our net loss  excluding non cash contingent consideration  to be million as of december   and therefore  we were in compliance with the net loss covenant 
our then existing negative covenants under the wells credit facility ie prior to the february  amendment included a limit of capital expenditures of million and an operating lease expenditure limit in of million 
we were in compliance with these negative covenants for the twelve months ended december  
table of contents the financial covenants of the wells credit facility require us to i maintain a minimum current ratio of  equal to the quotient of modified current assets to current liabilities and ii not exceed quarterly operating loss amounts excluding non cash contingent consideration associated with our acquisition of nellix of million for the quarter ended march   million for the six months ended june   million for the nine months ended september   and million for the year ended december  the wells credit facility also contains a material adverse change clause mac 
if we encountered difficulties that would qualify as a mac in our i operations  ii condition financial or otherwise  or iii ability to repay amounts outstanding under the wells credit facility  it could be canceled at wells sole discretion 
wells could then elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
credit risk the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the us however  we also have significant receivable balances from customers within the european union  japan  brazil  argentina  and mexico 
our accounts receivable in the us are primarily due from public and private hospitals 
our accounts receivable outside of the us are primarily due from independent distributors  and to a lesser extent  public and private hospitals 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
our independent distributors operate in certain countries such as greece and italy  where economic conditions continue to present challenges to our independent distributors businesses  and thus  could place in risk the amounts due to us from them 
our accounts receivable associated with our distributors in greece and italy  totaling million  are presently subject to payment delays 
these distributors are owed amounts from public hospitals that are funded by their governments 
adverse financial conditions may continue in these countries  thus negatively affecting the length of time that it will take us to collect these accounts receivable  or impact the likelihood of ultimate collection 
we recently performed a careful evaluation of each of these distributor s credit risk profile  and believe we will collect on their outstanding balances in full during future capital requirements we believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and successfully bring these technologies to market 
we expect to incur significant expenditures in completing product development and clinical trials for our nellix and ventana products 
we also expect to incur significant expenditures for the growth of our european sales force 
in december  in conjunction with our acquisition of nellix  we completed a private placement offering of our common stock to nellix s then largest shareholder  resulting in net proceeds of million 
the proceeds have been  and will continue to be used towards the commercial launch of the nellix device 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the need for working capital to support our sales growth  the need for additional capital to fund future development programs  the need for additional capital to fund our sales force expansion the need for additional capital to fund strategic acquisitions  our requirements for additional facility space or manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional information technology infrastructure and systems  and adverse outcomes from current or future litigation and the cost to defend such litigation 
we nonetheless believe that our future capital needs will be wholly met through the cash generated from our operations  and thus  we do not expect to access the capital markets  beyond maintaining our wells credit facility 
if we require additional financing  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain such financing it may cause substantial dilution in the case of an equity financing  or may contain burdensome restrictions on the operation of our business in the case of debt financing 
if we are not able to obtain required financing  we may need to curtail our operations and or our planned product development 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period at december  total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support  or involve leasing  hedging for our business  except for operating lease arrangements 
in addition  we have no arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our revolving credit facility with wells 
all outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of day libor  the federal funds rate  or the lender s prime rate  plus 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
however  if we draw down on our credit line with wells  we may be exposed to market risk due to changes in the rates at which interest accrues 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio consisted of solely money market instruments 
foreign currency transaction risk 
while a majority of our business is denominated in the us dollar  a portion of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro or the british pound sterling may affect our results of operations and the period to period comparisons of our operating results
