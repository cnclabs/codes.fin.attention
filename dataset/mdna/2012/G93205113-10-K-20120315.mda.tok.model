table of contents part i item business 
our company we are an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern  high specification drilling units 
our principal business is to contract drilling units  related equipment and work crews  primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers 
we also provide construction supervision services for  and will operate and manage  drilling units owned by others 
through our fleet of drilling units  we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies  focused primarily on international markets 
we are an exempted company incorporated with limited liability in the cayman islands  organized in drilling fleet jackups a jackup rig is a mobile  self elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support  at which point the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations 
all of our jackup rigs were built at ppl shipyard in singapore 
the design of our jackup rigs is the baker marine pacific class these units are ultra premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to feet of water  a cantilever drilling floor  and a total drilling depth capacity of approximately  feet 
drillships drillships are self propelled  dynamically positioned and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity 
the platinum explorer and the dragonquest are designed for drilling in water depths of up to  feet  with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to  feet 
the drillships hull design has a variable deck load of approximately  tons and measures feet long by feet wide 
the platinum explorer began operating in december the following table sets forth certain information concerning our owned and managed offshore drilling fleet 
name ownership year built expected delivery water depth rating feet drilling depth capacity feet status jackups emerald driller  operating sapphire driller  operating aquamarine driller  operating topaz driller  operating drillships platinum explorer   operating dragonquest   commissioning tungsten explorer   under construction the drillships are designed to drill in up to  feet of water  but are or will be equipped to drill in  feet of water 
the dragonquest was formerly known as the titanium explorer 
we are currently overseeing the construction of this drillship pursuant to a construction supervision agreement and have an eight year contract with petrobras to operate this vessel upon delivery 
see drilling unit agreements and drilling construction supervision and management service agreements 

table of contents strengths premium fleet 
our fleet is currently comprised of seven ultra premium high specification drilling units  including jackup rigs and drillships  of which we own four jackup rigs and two drillships 
we believe the emerald driller  sapphire driller  aquamarine driller and topaz driller are ultra premium jackup rigs due to their ability to drill in deeper depths  as well as their enhanced operational efficiency and technical capabilities when compared to a majority of the current global jackup rig fleet  which is primarily comprised of older  smaller  less capable rigs using less modern technology 
in addition  the platinum explorer is an ultra deepwater drillship that is equipped to drill in water depths of up to  feet  which we believe to be the upper limit water depth currently targeted by leading offshore exploration and production companies for new deepwater development projects 
strong asset coverage 
our owned fleet includes four jackups  at a cost of approximately million each  or million total  one drillship  at a cost of approximately million and one drillship under construction at a current cost to date of approximately million  anticipated total completed cost of approximately million  for a total of approximately billion 
these costs reflect all incurred costs associated with the purchase  construction  delivery and commissioning of the vessels  as well as significant supplies of spare major components with respect to the drillship 
as of december   we had approximately billion of debt outstanding  which represents a ratio of x total cost to debt outstanding 
proven track record 
we have a proven track record of successfully managing  constructing  marketing and operating offshore drilling units  having previously managed significant drilling fleets for some of our competitors 
our in house team of engineers and construction personnel has overseen complex rig construction projects 
as a result  the emerald driller  sapphire driller  aquamarine driller  topaz driller and platinum explorer have been delivered within budget and either on time or ahead of schedule 
collectively  our jackup fleet has experienced approximately of productive time during which we believe is above average for the industry 
the platinum explorer experienced approximately of productive time during  which we believe is outstanding for the first year of operation 
experienced management and operational team 
we benefit from our management team  which has extensive experience and an average of years in the drilling industry  including international and domestic public company experience involving numerous acquisitions and debt and equity financings 
strategy our strategy is to capitalize on customer demand for modern  high specification units 
we own and manage high specification state of the art drilling units  which are well suited to meet the requirements of customers for efficiently drilling through deep and complex geological formations  and drilling horizontally 
additionally  high specification drilling units generally provide faster drilling and moving times 
since  a majority of the bid invitations for jackups that we received required high specification units 
aside from their drilling capabilities  we believe that customers generally prefer new drilling units because of improved safety features and less frequent downtime for maintenance 
new  modern drilling units are also generally preferred by crews  which makes it easier to hire and retain high quality operating personnel 
focus on international markets 
we have been able to successfully deploy and operate our drilling units in some of the most active international oil and natural gas producing regions 
we believe that exposure to certain international markets with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies will increase the predictability of our cash flows because those markets have exhibited less cyclicality than the us gulf of mexico market  in which we do not currently operate 
we also believe that our internationally diverse platform reduces our exposure to a single market 
through the continued growth of our presence in asia and west africa  we intend to capitalize on our existing infrastructure to better serve our customers 

table of contents increase our deepwater exposure 
in recent years  there has been increased emphasis on exploration in deeper waters due  in part  to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective 
we believe that the water depth capability of our ultra deepwater drilling units is attractive to our customers and allows us to compete effectively in obtaining long term deepwater drilling contracts 
we will seek to manage or acquire additional deepwater drilling units to service this market 
expand key industry relationships 
we are focused on expanding relationships with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies  focused primarily on international markets  which we believe will allow us to obtain longer term contracts to build our backlog of business when dayrates and operating margins justify entering into such contracts 
we believe that our existing relationships with these companies have contributed to our strong contract backlog 
longer term contracts increase revenue visibility and mitigate some of the volatility in cash flows caused by cyclical market downturns 
identify and pursue acquisition opportunities 
we plan to continue to grow through strategic acquisitions of assets and other offshore drilling companies 
as part of our acquisition strategy  we anticipate raising additional debt and equity capital which may  at times  initially increase our overall leverage  but within a level that we believe to be appropriate based on our contract backlog and other factors 
our industry the offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling  workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling rigs 
historically  the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates 
periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time 
as is common throughout the oilfield services industry  offshore drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas 
sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and  as a result  greater demand for our services 
beginning in  global disruption in the financial markets and depressed oil and gas prices reduced demand for offshore drilling during these conditions improved in and as the financial markets stabilized and oil prices recovered 
with the market improvement  oil and gas companies have increased spending for offshore drilling services 
we believe that market conditions will generally continue to improve in and lead to a more robust contracting environment 
however  in civil unrest in the middle east  west africa and north africa reduced access to these markets and resulted in force majeure terminations or postponement of drilling contracts by customers operating in these regions 
additionally  the aftermath of the macondo incident in the us gulf of mexico continues to constrain deepwater drilling in a major market region 
markets offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another 
the cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions 
however  significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long term because of rig mobility 
the offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water ft  midwater ft  deepwater  ft 
and ultra deepwater  ft the global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups 
our jackup fleet is focused on the long legged ft high specification market 
the drillships that we operate and have agreements to operate are focused on the ultra deepwater segment which has been very strong in recent years as demand for ultra deepwater rigs has exceeded supply 

table of contents customers our customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies  government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers 
for the years ended december   and  the following customers accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the years ending december  oil and natural gas corporation ongc valencia drilling corporation valencia seadragon offshore limited pearl oil thailand ltd 
vaalco gabon etame  inc petrovietnam drilling and well services foxtrot international ldc drilling unit agreements our drilling contracts are the result of negotiation with our customers  and most contracts are awarded through competitive bidding against other contractors 
drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis  with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control 
currently all of our drilling contracts are on a dayrate basis 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term 
certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment 
such payments may not  however  fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee  under various circumstances such as non performance  in the event of downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues  or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events 
many of these events are beyond our control 
the contract term in some instances may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term 
our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the client to extend the contract to finish drilling a well in progress 
during periods of depressed market conditions  our clients may seek to renegotiate drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts 
suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the following table sets forth certain information concerning the contract status of our owned and managed offshore drilling fleet

table of contents average drilling revenue per day is based on the total estimated revenue divided by the minimum number of days committed in a contract 
unless otherwise noted  the total estimated revenue includes mobilization and demobilization fees and other contractual revenues associated with the drilling services 
for more information on the contract with ongc  see contract backlog below 
we will manage this vessel pursuant to a management services agreement and will only receive management fees pursuant to this agreement 
for more information  see drillship construction supervision and management services agreements 
the average drilling revenue per day includes the achievement of a bonus opportunity  but excludes mobilization revenues and revenue escalations included in the contract 
contract backlog as of december   our owned fleet had total contract backlog of approximately billion  including estimated contract backlog with ongc for the platinum explorer of approximately million 
based upon our current projections of operating expenses  we estimate that the ongc contract will generate approximately million to million in annual ebitda over the five year contract 
additionally  the dragonquest has contract backlog of approximately billion from which we expect to receive approximately to million per year in management fees over the eight year term of the contract 
drillship construction supervision and management services agreements we are party to agreements to manage the construction of the dragonquest and the dalian developer 
our counterparty for the dragonquest agreement is an affiliate of f capital  our largest shareholder and an affiliate of ours 
during the construction of each of these drillships  these agreements entitle us to receive a fixed fee 
we also have an agreement to manage the operations of the dragonquest 
once the dragonquest is operational  the agreement entitles us to receive a fixed fee per day plus a performance fee based on the operational performance of the drillship and marketing fees for every charter agreement we secure on behalf of the dragonquest 
valencia may terminate their obligations under the agreement if any of the following occur i we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement after being given notice and time to cure  ii we go into liquidation or cease to carry on our business  iii the dragonquest is damaged to the point of being inoperable  or iv the dragonquest is sold and no outstanding payments are owed to us 
valencia may terminate the agreement at will only if there are no outstanding bids  proposals or contractual commitments to customers 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive 
demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis 
pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
rig availability  capabilities  age and each contractor s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination 
operators also may consider crew experience  rig location and efficiency 
we believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future 
certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do  which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization  compete more effectively on the basis of price  build new rigs or acquire existing rigs 

table of contents our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller  locally owned companies 
competition for rigs is usually on a global basis  as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved  at a cost that is sometimes substantial  from one region to another in response to demand 
operating hazards our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the offshore drilling business  including  but not limited to blowouts  craterings  fires  explosions  equipment failures  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
these hazards could cause personal injury or death  serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment  suspension of drilling operations  or damage to the environment  including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas 
generally  we seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our customers for some of these risks 
to the extent not transferred to customers by contract  we seek protection against some of these risks through insurance  including property casualty insurance on our rigs and drilling equipment  protection and indemnity  commercial general liability  which has coverage extension for underground resources and equipment coverage  commercial contract indemnity and commercial umbrella insurance 
there are risks that are outside of our control 
nonetheless  we believe that we are adequately insured for liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
however  such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters  extensive fire damage or damage to the environment 
for more  see risk factors our business involves numerous operating hazards  and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses 
insurance we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage  third party liability  employer s liability  war risk  general liability  vessel pollution and other coverages 
however  our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages 
our primary marine package provides for hull and machinery coverage for our drilling units up to a scheduled value for each asset 
the maximum coverage for these assets is billion 
the policies are subject to exclusions  limitations  deductibles and other conditions 
deductibles for physical damage to our jackup rigs and the platinum explorer are million and million  respectively  per occurrence 
our protection and indemnity policy provides liability coverage limits of million per rig 
in addition to these policies  we have separate policies providing coverage for onshore general liability  employer s liability  auto liability and non owned aircraft liability  with customary coverage  limits and deductibles 
environmental regulation our operations are conducted primarily in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to  and affected in varying degrees by  governmental laws and regulations in countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and natural gas exploration and development  environmental protection  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of drilling units and other equipment 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so 
operations in 
table of contents less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries  which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings 
for a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation on our current operations  see risk factors our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages 
as our operations increase  we anticipate that we will make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
to date  we have not expended material amounts in order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures 
we currently do not have operations in the united states 
however  we are contracted to operate the dragonquest upon completion of construction  and are scheduled to commence operations in the u 
s 
gulf of mexico for petrobras 
heightened environmental concerns in the us gulf of mexico has led to greater and more stringent environmental regulation  higher drilling costs  and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process  which  in general  may adversely affect drilling activity in the us gulf of mexico 
in the united states  requirements applicable to our operations will include regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals  control the discharge of materials into the environment  require removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment  or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the us federal water pollution control act of  commonly referred to as the clean water act  prohibits the discharge of pollutants  including petroleum  into the navigable waters of the united states without a permit 
the regulations implementing the clean water act require permits to be obtained by an operator before discharge from specified exploration activities occur 
certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure plans and facility response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters 
violations of monitoring  reporting  permitting and other requirements can result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
the us oil pollution act of opa and related regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
a responsible party includes the owners or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
the opa establishes a liability limit for offshore facilities of all removal costs plus million  and a lesser limit for some vessels depending on their size 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa  and the liability could be substantial 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation in the event of a spill could subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement action 
congress has been urged to consider changes to opa that would increase or eliminate the limits on liability 
opa requires owners and operators of certain vessels to establish and maintain with the us coast guard evidence of financial responsibility 
vessel owners and operators may evidence their financial responsibility by showing proof of insurance  surety bond  self insurance or guarantee 
law governing air emissions and solid and hazardous waste may also apply to our operations 
the us outer continental shelf lands act authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the outer continental shelf 
included among these are regulations that require the preparation of spill contingency plans and establish air quality standards for certain 
table of contents pollutants  including particulate matter  volatile organic compounds  sulfur dioxide  carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides 
specific design and operational standards may apply to outer continental shelf vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures 
violations of lease conditions or regulations related to the environment issued pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases 
such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution 
in recent years  a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security were adopted to address terrorism risks  including the us coast guard regulations implementing the maritime transportation and security act of these regulations required  among other things  the development of vessel security plans and on board installation of automatic information systems  or ais  to enhance vessel to vessel and vessel to shore communications 
the united states is one of approximately member countries to the international maritime organization imo  a specialized agency of the united nations that is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships 
among the various international conventions negotiated by the imo is the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol 
marpol imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills  management of garbage  the handling and disposal of noxious liquids  harmful substances in packaged forms  sewage and air emissions 
annex vi to marpol sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances 
annex vi also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions 
for vessels gross tons and greater  platforms and drilling units  annex vi imposes various survey and certification requirements 
for this purpose  gross tonnage is based on the international tonnage certificate for the vessel 
the united states has ratified annex vi 
in addition  any drilling units we operate internationally are  however  subject to the requirements of annex vi in those countries that have implemented its provisions 
we believe the drilling units we currently offer for international projects are generally exempt from the more costly compliance requirements of annex vi 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring significant costs to comply with annex vi in the near term 
although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations  such compliance has not materially adversely affected our earnings or competitive position 
we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to which we are subject 
employees at january   we had a managed headcount of approximately  of which were our direct employees 
as we continue to enter into construction supervision and management services agreements  as well as acquire our own vessels  we will continue to hire more employees to meet our needs

risk factors 
there are numerous factors that affect our business and operating results  many of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of significant factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein  not currently known to us or currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial position  operating results and or cash flows 
our business is difficult to evaluate due to our limited operating history and our prospects will be dependent on our ability to meet a number of challenges 
because we have a limited operating history  you may not be able to evaluate our future prospects accurately 
our prospects will be primarily dependent on our ability to maintain customer drilling contracts for our drilling units and other factors listed below 
if we are not able to successfully meet these challenges  our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
a small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more of these customers could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a few customers 
during the fiscal year ended december   two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any one of these customers interrupt or curtail their activities  fail to pay for the services that have been performed  terminate their contracts  fail to renew their existing contracts or refuse to award new contracts and we are unable to enter into contracts with new customers on comparable terms 
the loss of any of our significant customers could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit risks of our key customers  including certain affiliated companies  and certain other third parties  and nonpayment by these customers and other parties could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers  including certain companies owned by or associated with our affiliates 
as of december   affiliates of f capital owed us approximately million on the dragonquest for construction services rendered by us 
additionally  we have deferred million of construction management fees until the delivery date of the dragonquest 
as a result  we have limited expenditures for this unit 
in addition  under the construction supervision contract for the cobalt explorer  a drillship for which construction was suspended in june  f capital owes us approximately million for services rendered in before the suspension of this contract 
any material nonpayment or nonperformance by these entities  other key customers and certain other third parties could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if any key customers or other parties default on their obligations to us  our financial results and condition could be adversely affected 
furthermore  some of these customers and other parties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks 
a material or extended decline in expenditures by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies due to a decline or volatility in oil and natural gas prices  a decrease in demand for oil and natural gas  or other factors  would adversely affect our business 
our business  including the utilization rates and dayrates we achieve for our owned and managed drilling units  depends on the level of activity in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production expenditures of our customers 
oil and natural gas prices and customers expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity 
commodity prices are affected by numerous factors  including the following changes in global economic conditions  including the continuation of the current recession  
table of contents the demand for oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  expectations regarding future prices  advances in exploration  development and production technology  the ability of opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves  the level of production in non opec countries  domestic and international tax policies  the development and exploitation of alternative fuels  weather  blowouts and other catastrophic events  the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves  and the worldwide military and political environment  uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or other crises in significant oil and natural gas producing regions or further acts of terrorism 
gulf of mexico drilling activity has been curtailed due to regulatory restrictions following the macondo blowout in early a prolonged decline in demand for drilling services may materially erode dayrates and utilization rates for drilling units  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and could have a significant negative impact on the market price of our securities 
our jackup drilling contracts are generally short term  and we could experience reduced profitability if customers reduce activity levels  terminate or seek to renegotiate drilling contracts with us  or if market conditions dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage or turnkey basis  rather than on a dayrate basis 
many jackup drilling contracts are short term  and oil and natural gas companies tend to reduce activity levels quickly in response to downward changes in oil and natural gas prices 
due to the short term nature of most of our jackup drilling contracts  a decline in market conditions can quickly affect our business if customers reduce their levels of operations 
during depressed market conditions  a customer may no longer need a unit that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable unit at a lower dayrate 
as a result  customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing drilling contracts or avoid their obligations under those contracts 
in addition  our customers may have the right to terminate  or may seek to renegotiate  existing contracts if we experience downtime  operational problems above the contractual limit or safety related issues  if the drilling unit is a total loss  if the drilling unit is not delivered to the customer within the period specified in the contract or in other specified circumstances  which include events beyond the control of either party 
some of our current jackup drilling contracts  and some drilling contracts that we may enter into in the future  may include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without cause  with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination payments 
in addition  we could be required to pay penalties  which could be material  if some of these contracts are terminated due to downtime  operational problems or failure to deliver 
some of the contracts with customers that we enter into in the future may be cancellable at the option of the customer upon payment of a penalty  which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract 
early termination of a contract may result in a drilling unit being idle for an extended period of time 
the likelihood 
table of contents that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness 
under most of our contracts  it is an event of default if we file a petition for bankruptcy or reorganization  which would allow the customer to terminate such contract 
currently  our drilling contracts are dayrate contracts  where we charge a fixed rate per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well 
while we plan to continue to perform services on a dayrate basis  market conditions may dictate that we enter into contracts that provide for payment based on a footage basis  where we are paid a fixed amount for each foot drilled regardless of the time required or the problems encountered in drilling the well  or enter into turnkey contracts  whereby we agree to drill a well to a specific depth for a fixed price and bear some of the well equipment costs 
these types of contracts are riskier for us than a dayrate contract as we would be subject to downhole geologic conditions in the well that cannot always be accurately determined and subject us to greater risks associated with equipment and downhole tool failures 
unfavorable downhole geologic conditions and equipment and downhole tool failures may result in significant cost increases or may result in a decision to abandon a well project which would result in us not being able to invoice revenues for providing services 
any such termination or renegotiation of contracts and unfavorable costs increases or loss of revenue could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
lower prices for oil and natural gas reduces demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
a slowdown in economic activity caused by the recession initially reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
benchmark crude prices peaked at over per barrel in july and then declined to approximately per barrel at year end during  the benchmark for crude prices fluctuated between the low s per barrel and low s per barrel 
demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
in addition  demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the near term levels of exploration  development  and production activity 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of our long lived assets 
failure to obtain delivery of the dragonquest may have a material and adverse effect on our business 
we have secured a drilling contract for the dragonquest which we are supervising the construction of for an affiliate of f capital 
we are not a party to the construction contract for this drilling unit and do not have control over any agreements between the owner and the shipyard 
if this unit is not completed  completed in a timely manner  delivered to us upon completion of construction or acceptable to our customer  or if we are unable to deliver this unit or an acceptable replacement  our drilling contract may be cancelled and or we may be required to pay damages to our customer  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
construction projects are subject to risks  including delays and cost overruns  which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy we may contract from time to time for the construction of drilling units or may enter into agreements to manage the construction of drilling units for others 
construction projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project  including costs or delays resulting from the following unexpected long delivery times for  or shortages of  key equipment  parts and materials  
table of contents shortages of skilled labor and other shipyard personnel necessary to perform the work  unforeseen increases in the cost of equipment  labor and raw materials  particularly steel  unforeseen design and engineering problems  unanticipated actual or purported change orders  work stoppages  latent damages or deterioration to hull  equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions  failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes  disputes with shipyards and suppliers  delays and unexpected costs of incorporating parts and materials needed for the completion of projects  financial or other difficulties at shipyards  adverse weather conditions  and inability to obtain required permits or approvals 
if we experience delays and costs overruns in the construction of drilling units due to certain of the factors listed above  it could also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are managing the construction of the dragonquest  which we will operate upon completion of construction and is scheduled for commencement with petrobras in the third quarter of delays in the delivery of this unit would result in the delay in contract commencement  resulting in financial penalties and a loss of revenue to us  and may also cause the customer to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the unit pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses 
in the event this unit is not completed on a timely basis  we may not be able to secure a replacement unit that is acceptable to the customer 
our business is affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions and the condition of the oil and natural gas industry 
recent economic data indicates the rate of economic growth worldwide has declined significantly from the growth rates experienced in recent years 
current economic conditions have resulted in uncertainty regarding energy and commodity prices 
in addition  future economic conditions may cause many oil and natural gas production companies to further reduce or delay expenditures in order to reduce costs  which in turn may cause a further reduction in the demand for drilling services 
if conditions worsen  our business and financial condition may be adversely impacted 
our industry is highly competitive  cyclical and subject to intense price competition 
due to our limited operating history  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
the offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive  and contracts have traditionally been awarded on a competitive bid basis 
the technical capabilities  availability and pricing of a drilling unit are often the primary factors in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job 
other key factors include a contractor s reputation for service  safety record  environmental record  technical and engineering support and long term relationships with major  national and independent oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors in the offshore contract drilling industry generally have larger  more diverse fleets  longer operating histories with established safety and environmental records over a measurable period of time and long term relationships with customers 
this provides our competitors with competitive advantages that may adversely affect our efforts to contract our drilling units on favorable terms  if at all  and correspondingly negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
additionally  we are at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that are better capitalized because they are in a better position to withstand the effects of a downturn in our industry 

table of contents the offshore contract drilling industry  historically  has been very cyclical with periods of high demand  limited supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand  excess supply and low dayrates 
many offshore drilling units are highly mobile 
competitors may move drilling units from region to region in response to changes in demand 
it is currently estimated that newly constructed jackup rigs will be entered into service between now and december and deepwater rigs are scheduled for delivery through this could result in an excess supply of rigs in the markets in which we operate 
periods of low demand and excess supply intensify competition in the industry and often result in some drilling units becoming idle for long periods of time 
our limited operating history may put us at a competitive disadvantage and  as a result  our drilling units may become idle 
prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates  or extended idle time  could result in the recognition of impairment charges on our drilling units if cash flow estimates  based upon information available to management at the time  indicate that the carrying value of the drilling units may not be recoverable 
there may be limits to our ability to mobilize drilling units between geographic markets and the time and costs of such drilling unit mobilizations may be material to our business 
the offshore contract drilling market is generally a global market as drilling units may be mobilized from one market to another market 
however  geographic markets can  from time to time  have material fluctuations in costs and risks as the ability to mobilize drilling units can be impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  governmental regulation and customs practices  the significant costs to move a drilling unit  availability of tow boats  weather  political instability  civil unrest  military actions  and the technical capability of the drilling units to operate in various environments 
any increase in the supply of drilling units in the geographic areas in which we operate  whether through new construction  refurbishment or conversion of drilling units from other uses  remobilization or changes in the law or its application  could increase competition and result in lower dayrates and or utilization  which would adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  while a drilling unit is being mobilized from one geographic market to another  we may not be paid by the customer for the time that the drilling unit is out of service 
also  we may mobilize the drilling unit to another geographic market without a customer contract which will result in costs not reimbursable by future customers 
our business involves numerous operating hazards  and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses 
our operations will be subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punchthroughs  craterings  fires and pollution 
the occurrence of these events such as events similar to the incident in the us gulf of mexico involving the macondo well could result in the suspension of drilling or production operations  claims by the operator and others affected by such events  severe damage to  or destruction of  the property and equipment involved  injury or death to drilling unit personnel  environmental damage and increased insurance costs 
we may also be subject to personal injury and other claims of drilling unit personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal operating conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services and personnel shortages 
in addition  our operations will be subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our drilling units could be damaged by high winds  turbulent seas  or unstable sea bottom conditions which could potentially cause us to curtail operations for significant periods of time until such damages are repaired 
damage to the environment could result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
we may also be subject to property  environmental and other damage claims by host governments  oil and natural gas companies and other businesses operating offshore and in coastal areas  as well as claims by individuals living in or around coastal areas 

table of contents as is customary in our industry  the risks of our operations are partially covered by our insurance and partially by contractual indemnities from our customers 
however  insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we may not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
moreover  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our drilling units  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our offshore drilling operations could be adversely impacted by the macondo well incident and the resulting changes in regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity 
in may  the us department of the interior implemented a six month moratorium suspension on certain drilling activities in water depths greater than feet in the us gulf of mexico 
the us department of the interior subsequently issued ntl s implementing additional safety and certification requirements applicable to drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico  imposed additional requirements with respect to development and production activities in the us gulf of mexico and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow water areas 
on july   the us department of the interior issued a revised moratorium suspension on drilling in the us gulf of mexico  which was lifted on october  after the adoption on september  of new regulations relating to the design of wells and testing of the integrity of wellbores  the use of drilling fluids  the functionality and testing of well control equipment  including blowout preventers  and other safety regulations 
as a condition to lifting of the moratorium suspension  the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement the boem was directed to require that each operator demonstrate that it has in place written and enforceable commitments that ensure that containment resources are available promptly in the event of a blowout and that the chief executive officer of each operator certify to the boem that the operator has complied with applicable regulations 
currently we do not have operations in the us gulf of mexico 
however  the dragonquest  which we will operate upon completion of construction  is currently scheduled to commence drilling operations in the us gulf of mexico in for petrobras 
at this time  we cannot predict the full impact of the macondo well incident and resulting changes in the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity on our operations or contracts or what actions may be taken by our customers  other industry participants or the us or other governments in response to the incident 
further legislative or regulatory enactments may impose new requirements for well control and blowout prevention equipment that could increase our costs and cause delays in our operations due to unavailability of associated equipment 
customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us 
consistent with standard industry practice  our customers generally assume liability for and indemnify us against well control and subsurface risks under our dayrate contracts  and we do not separately purchase insurance for such indemnified risks 
these risks are those associated with the loss of control of a well  such as blowout or cratering for example  the recent incident in the us gulf of mexico involving the macondo well  the cost to regain control or redrill the well and associated pollution 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain agreements from customers to indemnify us for such damages and risks or the indemnities that we do obtain may be limited in scope and duration 
additionally  even if our customers agree to indemnify us  there can be no assurance that they will necessarily be financially able to indemnify us against all of these risks 

table of contents our insurance coverage may not be adequate if a catastrophic event occurs 
as a result of the number and significance of catastrophic events in the offshore drilling industry in recent years  such as hurricanes and spills in the gulf of mexico  insurance underwriters have increased insurance premiums and increased restrictions on coverage and have made other coverages  such as gulf of mexico windstorm coverage  unavailable 
while we believe we have reasonable policy limits of property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for acts of terrorism  with financially sound insurers  we cannot guarantee that our policy limits for property  casualty  liability  and business interruption insurance  including coverage for severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  would be adequate should a catastrophic event occur related to our property  plant or equipment  or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages 
when any of our coverage expires  or when we seek coverage in the future  we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage will be available  offered at reasonable prices  or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness 
the occurrence of an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our drilling units could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage and or our liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer was unable to sufficiently or fully pay related claims or damages 
our international operations are subject to additional political  economic  and other uncertainties not generally associated with domestic operations 
a primary component of our business strategy is to operate in international oil and natural gas producing areas 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries  including political  social and economic instability  war and acts of terrorism  potential seizure  expropriation or nationalization of assets  damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees  including kidnappings  piracy  increased operating costs  complications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations  repudiation  modification or renegotiation of contracts  limitations on insurance coverage  such as war risk coverage in certain areas  import export quotas  confiscatory taxation  work stoppages  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  wage and price controls  imposition of trade barriers  imposition or changes in enforcement of local content laws  restrictions on currency or capital repatriations  currency fluctuations and devaluations  and other forms of government regulation and economic conditions that are beyond our control 

table of contents our financial condition and results of operations could be susceptible to adverse events beyond our control that may occur in the particular country or region in which we are active 
additionally  we may experience currency exchange losses where  at some future date  revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where we do not hedge exposure to a foreign currency 
we may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available in the country of operation  controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital 
many governments favor or effectively require that drilling contracts be awarded to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these practices may result in inefficiencies or put us at a disadvantage when bidding for contracts against local competitors 
our offshore contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the equipment and operation of drilling units  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and natural gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of drilling units and other equipment 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so 
operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries  which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings 
our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages 
many aspects of our operations are affected by governmental laws and regulations that may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry  including those requiring us to control the discharge of oil and other contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
countries where we currently operate have environmental laws and regulations covering the discharge of oil and other contaminants and protection of the environment in connection with operations 
additionally  any operations and activities in the united states and its territorial waters will be subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  including the clean water act  the opa  the outer continental shelf lands act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and marpol 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and even criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit our operations 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering us liable for environmental and natural resource damages without regard to negligence or fault on our part 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
the application of these requirements  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and natural gas could materially limit future contract drilling opportunities or materially increase our costs 
in addition  we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with laws and regulations 
furthermore  some financial institutions are imposing  as a condition to financing  requirements to comply with additional non governmental environmental and social standards  such as the equator principles  in connection with operations outside the united states 
such additional standards could impose significant new costs on us  which may materially and adversely affect us 

table of contents changes in us federal laws and regulations  or in those of other jurisdictions where we operate  including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages  may adversely affect our operations 
if the us government amends or prescribes new federal laws or regulations  our potential exposure to liability for operations and activities in the united states and its territorial waters may increase 
as a result of the macondo incident in the us gulf of mexico  the us congress is currently considering bills to repeal federal caps on liability for pollution or contamination under the oil pollution act of even if these caps are not repealed  future bills and regulations may increase our liability for pollution or contamination resulting from any operations and activities we may have in the united states and its territorial waters including punitive damages  administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
although we are contracted to operate the dragonquest in the us gulf of mexico upon completion of construction  currently we have no operations in the us gulf of mexico  however  other jurisdictions where we operate may also modify their laws and regulations in a manner that would increase our liability for pollution and other environmental damage 
new technology and or products may cause us to become less competitive 
the offshore contract drilling industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling techniques and services using new technologies  some of which may be subject to patent protection 
as competitors and others use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
further  we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that may allow them to access technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technology or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
thus  our inability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technology may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 
as of december   on a consolidated basis  we had total senior indebtedness outstanding of approximately billion consisting of the senior secured notes and the f capital note 
subject to the restrictions in the indenture governing the senior secured notes  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences for an investment in us and significant effects on our business 
for example  our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our indebtedness and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase senior secured notes tendered to us if there is a change of control or in connection with an excess cash flow offer  which would constitute a default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on the senior secured notes and other debt  which would reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other investments  or general corporate purposes  which may limit our ability to execute our business strategy  heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business  our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions  
table of contents place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  limit management s discretion in operating our business  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  the industry in which we operate or the general economy  and result in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings 
each of these factors may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and viability 
our ability to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affecting our company and industry  many of which are beyond our control 
we may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
even with our existing level of debt  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial amounts of additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in the future  including debt under future credit facilities  some or all of which may be secured on a first priority basis and therefore would rank contractually senior to the senior secured notes to the extent of the value of that collateral 
as of december   we would have the ability to incur additional indebtedness under the indenture for the senior secured notes  including up to million of additional indebtedness under any credit agreement that may be entered into by us 
although the terms of the senior secured notes and any future credit facilities will limit our ability to incur additional debt  these terms do not and will not prohibit us from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt for specific purposes or under certain circumstances 
in addition  the indenture governing the senior secured notes will allow us to issue additional senior secured notes under certain circumstances  which additional notes will also be guaranteed by the guarantors and will share in the collateral that will secure the senior secured notes and guarantees 
we may also incur other additional indebtedness secured by liens that rank equal to those securing the senior secured notes in which case  the holders of that debt will be entitled to share equally with the holders of the senior secured notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with our winding up  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization or dissolution 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify and could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business 
the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries ability to take various actions  such as paying dividends  redeeming subordinated indebtedness or making other restricted payments  incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or  with respect to our restricted subsidiaries or any other subsidiary guarantor  issuing preferred stock  creating or incurring liens  incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries  consummating a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries assets  entering into transactions with affiliates  
table of contents transferring or selling assets  engaging in business other than our current business and reasonably related extensions thereof  issuing capital stock of certain subsidiaries  taking or omitting to take any actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing our indebtedness  terminating or amending certain material contracts  amending  modifying or changing our organizational documents  and employing our drilling units in certain jurisdictions 
we may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise if we fail to meet certain ratios or because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the indenture governing the senior secured notes 
in addition  the restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes and any future credit facility may also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions  meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations  enter into acquisitions  execute our business strategy  effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted or engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 
in the future  we may also incur debt obligations that might subject us to additional and different restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility 
we cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements  or that we will be able to refinance our debt on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure investors that we will satisfy those requirements 
a breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under our existing and future debt agreements which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable 
this would likely in turn trigger cross acceleration and cross default rights under the terms of our indebtedness outstanding at such time 
if the amounts outstanding under our indebtedness were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders 
our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions  fail to successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses we acquire  or are unable to obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of assets or businesses that we believe to be complementary to our drilling operations is an important component of our business strategy 
we believe that acquisition opportunities may arise from time to time  and that any such acquisition could be significant 
at any given time  discussions with one or more potential sellers may be at different stages 
however  any such discussions may not result in the consummation of an acquisition transaction  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisitions 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that any announcement or consummation of an acquisition would have on the trading price of our securities 
our business is capital intensive and any such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash 
we may need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings to execute our growth strategy and to fund acquisitions 
adequate sources of capital may not be available when needed on favorable terms 
if we raise additional capital by issuing additional equity securities  existing shareholders may be diluted 
if our capital resources are insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to fund acquisitions  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could harm our business 
any future acquisitions could present a number of risks  including the risk of using management time and resources to pursue acquisitions that are not successfully completed  
table of contents the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations  the risk of failing to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely  and the risk of diversion of management s attention from existing operations or other priorities 
if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other operations or assets  our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be unable to implement an important component of our business strategy successfully 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in integrating our acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
we do not expect operating and maintenance costs to necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in operating revenues 
operating revenues may fluctuate as a function of changes in dayrates 
however  costs for operating a drilling unit are generally fixed or only semi variable regardless of the dayrate being earned 
in addition  should the drilling units incur idle time between contracts  we would typically maintain the crew to prepare the drilling unit for its next contract and would not reduce costs to correspond to the decrease in revenue 
during times of moderate activity  reductions in costs may not be immediate as the crew may be required to prepare the drilling units for stacking  after which time the crew will be reduced to a level necessary to maintain the drilling unit in working condition with the extra crew members assigned to active drilling units or dismissed 
in addition  as drilling units are mobilized from one geographic location to another  the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly 
equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment 
contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized 
the loss of some of our key executive officers and employees could negatively impact our business prospects 
our future operational performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued service of key members of our management as well as marketing  sales and operations personnel 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and further motivate highly skilled management  marketing  sales and operations personnel 
we may experience intense competition for personnel  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain key employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining personnel in the future 
failure to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers or an increase in labor costs could hurt our operations 
we require skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services to  and support for  our drilling units 
in periods of increasing activity and when the number of operating units in our areas of operation increases  either because of new construction  re activation of idle units or the mobilization of units into the region  shortages of qualified personnel could arise  creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing 
the shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel also could negatively affect the quality and timeliness of our work 
in addition  our ability to expand operations depends in part upon our ability to increase the size of the skilled labor force 

table of contents while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from the requirement that we evaluate our internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required to comply with the management certification requirements of  and preparing for the auditor attestation under  section as a result  we have incurred additional expenses and a diversion of management s time 
while we have been able to fully implement the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate in the future to ensure compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act or the foreign corrupt practices act 
if we are not able to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  we may be susceptible to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec 
any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our securities 
changes in tax laws  treaties or regulations  effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws  treaties and regulations  both internationally and domestically 
tax laws  treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation 
we are subject to changing tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate 
our income tax expense is based upon the interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred 
a change in these tax laws  treaties or regulations  or in the interpretation thereof  could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings 
if any country successfully challenges our income tax filings based on our structure or the presence of our operations there  or if we otherwise lose a material dispute  our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and similar worldwide anti bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
our policies mandate compliance with these laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
despite our extensive training and compliance program  we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper acts committed by our employees or agents 
violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that us laws and regulations prohibit us from using 
in order to effectively compete in some foreign jurisdictions  we utilize local agents and seek to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance  if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or omissions  or due to the acts or omissions of others  including actions taken by our agents and our strategic or local partners  even though our agents and partners may not be subject to the fcpa  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may be required to repurchase certain of our indebtedness with cash upon a change of control 
upon the occurrence of specified change of control events in the indenture governing the senior secured notes  we will be required to offer to repurchase all of such outstanding notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of such notes repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any  up to  but not including the date of repurchase 
we may not have sufficient funds available to repurchase all of the notes tendered pursuant to any such offer and any other debt that would become payable upon a change of control or in connection with such an asset sale offer 
any of our future debt agreements may also limit our ability to repurchase these notes until all such debt is paid in full 
our failure to purchase these notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes  which would in turn likely trigger a default under our existing and any future debt agreements 
in addition  the occurrence of a change of control may also constitute an event of default under our existing and any future debt agreements 
in that event  we would need to cure or refinance the applicable debt agreements before making an offer to purchase 
moreover  any future indebtedness we incur may restrict our ability to repurchase these notes  including following a change of control 
we may be unable to repay all of such indebtedness or obtain a waiver of that type 
any requirement to offer to repurchase outstanding notes may therefore require us to refinance our other outstanding debt  which we may not be able to accomplish on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
these repurchase requirements may also delay or make it more difficult for others to obtain control of us 
our related party transactions with f capital and its affiliates may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect us 
we have entered into  and may  in the future  enter into various transactions and agreements with f capital and its affiliates 
f capital has no fiduciary duty to make decisions in our best interest 
f capital is entitled to vote our ordinary shares that it owns in accordance with its interests  which may be contrary to our interests and those of other shareholders 
f capital and its other affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and are not obligated to offer us business opportunities or to offer to sell additional assets to us 
we believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with f capital are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties 
however  these relationships could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and f capital or its affiliates 
the appearance of conflicts  even if such conflicts do not materialize  might adversely affect the public s perception of us  as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business 
in addition  conflicts of interest may arise between us and f capital and its affiliates 
f capital may favor its own interests over our interests and those of other shareholders 
f capital holds a significant interest in us 
as of january   on a fully diluted basis  f capital owned approximately of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares  including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants 
through his ownership of f capital  hsin chi su  a former director of the company  has significant influence over matters such as the election of our directors  control over our business  policies and affairs and other matters submitted to our shareholders 
because we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands  you may face difficulties in protecting your interests  and your ability to protect your rights through the us federal courts may be limited 
we are an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands 
in addition  most of our directors and executive officers are nationals or residents of jurisdictions other than the united states and all or a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for holders of our securities to effect service of process within the united states upon our directors or executive officers  or enforce judgments obtained in the us courts against our directors or executive officers 

table of contents our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association  the companies law revision as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time  and the common law of the cayman islands 
the rights of holders of our securities to take action against the directors  actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are  to a large extent  governed by the common law of the cayman islands 
the common law of the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands as well as from english common law  the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority  but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands 
the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under cayman islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the united states 
in particular  the cayman islands has a less developed body of securities laws thus providing significantly less protection to investors as compared to the united states  and some states  such as delaware  which have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law 
the cayman islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce against us judgment of courts of the united states based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws  and to impose civil liabilities against us  in original actions brought in the cayman islands  based on certain civil liability provisions of us securities laws that are penal in nature 
additionally  cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states 
there is no statutory recognition in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  although the courts of the cayman islands will in certain circumstances recognize and enforce a non penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without re examination of the merits at common law  provided such judgment is final and conclusive  is one in respect of which the federal court of the united states had jurisdiction over the defendant according to cayman islands conflict of law rules  is either for a liquidated sum not in respect of penalties or taxes or a fine or similar fiscal or revenue obligations or  in certain circumstances  for in personam non monetary relief  and was neither obtained in a manner  nor is of a kind enforcement of which is contrary to natural justice of the public policy of the cayman islands 
the grand court of the cayman islands may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere
