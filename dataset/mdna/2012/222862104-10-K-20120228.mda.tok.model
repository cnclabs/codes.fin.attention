our workers compensation customers are also subject to state governmental regulation 
historically  governmental strategies to contain medical costs in the workers compensation field have been limited to legislation on a state by state basis 
many states have adopted guidelines for utilization management and have implemented fee schedules that list maximum reimbursement levels for health care procedures 
in certain states that have not authorized the use of a fee schedule  we adjust bills to the usual and customary levels authorized by the payor 
federal regulation privacy  security and other hipaa requirements the use  disclosure and secure handling of individually identifiable health information by our business is regulated at the federal level  including the privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and privacy and security regulations pursuant to hipaa 
many of our business operations are considered to be covered entities entities covered by hipaa  while others are classified as business associates entities that handle identifiable information on behalf of covered entities 
in addition  our privacy and security practices are subject to various state laws and regulations 
varying requirements and enforcement approaches in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
these state and federal requirements change frequently as a result of legislation  regulations and judicial or administrative interpretations 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra broadened the scope of the hipaa privacy and security regulations 
among other things  arra extended the application of certain provisions of the hipaa security and privacy regulations to business associates and subjected business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations 
arra also strengthened the enforcement provisions of hipaa  which may result in increased enforcement activity 
under arra  hhs is required to conduct periodic hipaa compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates 
hhs has announced a pilot program to perform audits of up to covered entities by the end of arra broadened the applicability of the criminal penalty provisions under hipaa to employees of covered entities and requires hhs to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect 
arra also significantly increased the amount of the civil penalties  with penalties of up to  per hipaa violation with a maximum civil penalty of  in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement 
in addition  state attorneys general may bring civil actions seeking either an injunction or damages in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents 

table of contents state and local authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting individuals from identity theft  with a significant number of states enacting laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches involving personal information 
covered entities are required by regulations issued pursuant to arra to report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay  but not to exceed days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents 
notification must also be made to hhs and  in certain situations involving large breaches  to the media 
hipaa includes administrative requirements directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions and establishing uniform health care provider  payor and employer identifiers 
hipaa also imposes obligations for health insurance issuers and health benefit plan sponsors 
hipaa requires guaranteed health care coverage for small employers having two to employees and for individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements 
hipaa also requires guaranteed renewability of health coverage for most employers and individuals and contains nondiscrimination requirements 
hipaa limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions for individuals covered under group policies to the extent the individuals had prior creditable coverage 
failure to comply with any of the statutory and regulatory hipaa requirements  state privacy and security requirements and other similar federal requirements could subject us to significant penalties 
erisa the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
for instance  the us department of labor regulations under erisa insured and self insured regulate the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establish requirements for plan responses to appeals and expand required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
these requirements and the provisions thereunder have been expanded by ppaca  including external review procedures 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
medicare and medicaid some of our subsidiaries contract with cms to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare advantage program 
some of our health plans also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulations 
cms periodically performs risk adjustment data validation radv audits for any health plan operating under a medicare managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law and contractual obligations 
additionally  in some instances states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicare managed care plans 
our health plans are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
cms rules require medicaid managed care plans to have beneficiary protections and protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  states must assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
states and plans must identify enrollees with special health care needs and assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
these requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our business 
the federal anti kickback statute imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including medicare  medicaid and the fehbp 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or in part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 

table of contents with respect to the federal anti kickback statute  there exists a statutory exception and two safe harbors addressing certain risk sharing arrangements 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general oig has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our subsidiaries to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
cms has promulgated regulations that prohibit health plans with medicare contracts from including any direct or indirect payment to physicians or other providers as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services to a medicare beneficiary 
these regulations impose disclosure and other requirements relating to physician incentive plans such as bonuses or withholds that could result in a physician being at substantial financial risk as defined in medicare regulations 
our ability to maintain compliance with such regulations depends  in part  on our receipt of timely and accurate information from our providers 
although we believe we are in compliance with all such medicare regulations  we are subject to future audit and review 
the federal false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting false claims to the federal government 
private individuals known as relators or whistleblowers may bring actions on the government s behalf under the false claims act and share in any settlement or judgment 
violations of the federal false claims act may result in treble damages and civil penalties of up to  for each false claim 
in some cases  whistleblowers  the federal government and some courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes such as the federal anti kickback statute have thereby submitted false claims under the false claims act 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the false claims act by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly or improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
under the deficit reduction act of defra  every entity that receives at least million annually in medicaid payments must establish written policies for all employees  contractors or agents  providing detailed information about false claims  false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws  including the federal false claims act  and similar state laws 
we have established written policies that we believe comply with this provision of defra 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
defra creates an incentive for states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal false claims act 
from time to time  companies in the healthcare industry  including ours  may be subject to actions under the false claims act or similar state laws 
in july  the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa became law 
mippa increased restrictions on marketing and sales activities of medicare advantage plans  including limitations on compensation systems for agents and brokers  limitations on solicitation of beneficiaries and prohibitions regarding many sales activities 
mippa also imposed restrictions on special needs plans  increased penalties for reimbursement delays under part d  required weekly reporting of pricing standards by medicare part d plans and implemented focused cuts to certain medicare advantage programs 
failure to comply with mippa or the regulations promulgated pursuant to mippa could result in penalties  including suspension of enrollment  suspension of payment  suspension of marketing  fines and or civil monetary penalties 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the united states office of personnel management opm and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the fehbp 
these contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the oig of the opm who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with opm 
for our managed care contracts  the oig conducts periodic audits to  among other things  verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
for our experience rated plans  the oig focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges  the effectiveness of claims processing  financial and cost accounting systems  and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments 
the oig may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans 
these audits are generally a number of years in arrears 

table of contents risk management in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims for medical services denied by the company  medical malpractice actions  employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we maintain general liability  professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate  with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves

ruhlmann was elected senior vice president of our company in november he served as vice president of our company from november to november mr 
ruhlmann has served as the corporate controller of our company since november item a risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
accordingly  costs we incur in excess of our cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
we estimate our costs of future benefit claims and related expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  inflation  historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors 
we also record benefits payable for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include 
table of contents an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiations of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophic events  including epidemics and natural disasters  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other legislative or regulatory changes that increase our costs  clusters of high cost cases  changes in or new technology  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical liabilities in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and reported but not paid claims 
the estimates for medical liabilities are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for medical liabilities are adequate  but we cannot assure you of this 
increases from our current estimates of liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
ppaca provides for significant health insurance market reforms and other changes to the health care industry affecting premium revenue and health care costs 
for example  ppaca currently prohibits lifetime limits on essential health benefits and rescinding coverage absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation  expands dependent coverage to include dependents up to age and implements new mandated benefits for certain preventive services 
beginning january   ppaca  among other things  prohibits group health plans from establishing annual limits on essential health benefits and excluding individuals based on pre existing conditions 
ppaca  as enacted  also will require a plan to issue coverage to every employer and individual who applies and will obligate plans to renew coverage once issued 
further  ppaca will prohibit plans from establishing eligibility rules and premium rates based on most health status related factors 
in addition  ppaca provides for significant new taxes  including an industry user tax paid by health insurance companies beginning in  an annual fee imposed on average covered lives in health insurance policies issued on individuals resident in the us for fiscal years beginning after september  and ending before september   and an excise tax of on health insurers and employers offering high cost health coverage plans 
also  effective for taxable years beginning after december   ppaca prohibits us from deducting on our corporate income tax returns compensation exceeding  annually for any employee or other individual providing services to us that was earned in or subsequent years 
these  among other changes  will affect our ability to predict or control future health care costs and could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
because ppaca is complex  it will be implemented gradually and is subject to possible amendment  we are unable to predict its effect on our costs 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
ppaca provides for a number of health insurance reforms  as well as an industry tax  that may increase our health care costs 
at the same time  ppaca requires insurers to submit to hhs and state regulators justifications for unreasonable rate increases and mandates these justifications be publicly disclosed 
beginning september   any rate increase of or more is subject to additional review for reasonableness by the state or  if the state lacks an adequate process  by hhs 
beginning in september  state specific guidelines will replace the threshold in states with an adequate process as determined by hhs 
further  by plan year  ppaca provides for monitoring of all premium increases and requires plans with excessive rate increases to be excluded from the insurance exchanges created under ppaca 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 
general economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our business  results of operations and investment portfolio 
unfavorable economic conditions  particularly high unemployment and reduced economic growth  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and investment portfolio 
for instance  a decline in members covered under our plans could result from layoffs and downsizing or the elimination of health benefits by employers seeking to cut costs 
economic conditions could cause our existing members to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or could  in addition to significant membership loss  result in lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership 
in addition  the economic downturn could negatively affect our employer group renewals and our ability to increase premiums 

table of contents the state of the economy also adversely affects the states budgets  which can result in states attempting to reduce payments to medicaid plans in those states in which we offer medicaid plans and to increase taxes and assessments on our activities 
although we could attempt to mitigate our exposure from such increased costs through  among other things  increases in premiums  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
a drop in the prices of securities across global financial markets could negatively affect our investment portfolio 
additionally  defaults by issuers of the corporate and municipal bonds in which we invest may also adversely affect our investment portfolio 
for example  while investments in municipal bonds have historically experienced relatively low rates of default  the current economic environment has resulted in many municipalities operating at a deficit 
some of our investments could further experience other than temporary declines in fair value  requiring us to record impairment charges that adversely affect our financial results 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in legal requirements from recently enacted federal or state laws or regulations  court decisions  or government audits  investigations and proceedings could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to offer many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely affect our results of operations 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations  including regulatory changes resulting from ppaca 
legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely affect our business and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  increase limits or regulatory oversight of premium levels or establish new or more stringent minimum medical expense ratios for certain products  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  increase government sponsorship of competing health plans  impose new or higher fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  impose new or higher fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews  increase regulation of or prohibit rental access to health care provider networks  increase regulation of or prohibit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  increase limits on the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization  including any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  increase limits on contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  implement new mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials  impose additional health care information privacy or security requirements  and increase restrictions on marketing medicare advantage  prescription drug plans or other products to individuals 
these or other changes could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
from time to time  states consider legislative proposals that could affect our ability to obtain appropriate premium rates and that would mandate certain benefits and forbid certain policy provisions  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
ppaca represents significant change across the health care industry 
ppaca  as enacted  seeks to decrease the number of uninsured individuals and expand coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
in order to expand coverage  ppaca  as enacted  requires individuals to obtain health insurance or pay penalties and mandates that employers with more than full time employees offer affordable insurance to employees or pay an assessment 
in addition  ppaca requires greater federal involvement in the regulation of health plans 
for example  ppaca prohibits the use of gender  health status  family history or occupation in setting premium rates and eliminates pre existing condition exclusions 
further  ppaca requires hhs to award loans and grants to new non profit entities that will offer qualified health plans 
ppaca also requires states to establish a health insurance exchange and permits states to create federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid 
ppaca requires states to expand eligibility under existing medicaid programs to those at or below of the federal poverty level 
in addition  ppaca may lead to increased state legislative and regulatory initiatives in order for states to comply with new federal mandates and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities 

table of contents many of these provisions of ppaca do not become effective until other provisions of ppaca are more immediate in nature and have already taken effect 
for example  ppaca currently bans lifetime limits on essential health benefits and the rescission of health care coverage absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation and imposes new benefit mandates including requiring preventative services and the provision of immunizations without member cost sharing 
ppaca also expands dependent coverage to include children up to age and mandates minimum medical loss ratios for health plans as calculated under the definitions in ppaca and related regulations  such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on health care medical costs and quality improvement expenses  be at least for individual and small group health coverage and for large group coverage  with rebates to policyholders if the actual loss ratios fall below these minimums 
states may request waivers to the medical loss ratio requirements for the individual market  if the state insurance commissioner determines there is a reasonable likelihood that destabilization will occur when the medical loss ratio requirements are applied 
hhs has approved waivers  which result in a temporary alteration to the medical loss ratio requirements  in four states in which we do business 
the waivers  which allow for a more gradual phase in of the minimum medical loss ratio requirement for the individual market  are expected to have a diminished effect in future years 
implementation of ppaca  particularly those provisions expanding health insurance coverage  could be delayed or even blocked due to court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law 
some federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of ppaca or dismissed challenges to its constitutionality on procedural grounds 
others have held the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance or pay a penalty to be unconstitutional and have either found ppaca void in its entirety or left the remainder of the law intact 
on november   the us supreme court announced that it will hear challenges to ppaca and its decision is expected to be issued in it is unclear how these challenges to the constitutionality of ppaca will be resolved or what the effect will be on any resulting changes to the law 
for example  should the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage ultimately be deemed unconstitutional but the prohibition on health plans excluding coverage due to pre existing conditions be maintained  our business could be adversely affected 
given the complexities of ppaca  the numerous regulations still to be issued that will detail its requirements  the lack of interpretive guidance and our inability to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices afforded them by the law  we cannot predict the full effect of ppaca on us at this time 
we also cannot predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we also may be subject to governmental investigations or inquiries from time to time 
the existence of such investigations in our industry could negatively affect the market value of all companies in our industry 
as a result of recent investigations  including audits  cms has imposed sanctions and fines including immediate suspension of all enrollment and marketing activities and civil monetary penalties on certain medicare advantage plans run by our competitors 
in addition  suits may be brought by a private individual under a qui tam suit  or whistleblower suit  such whistleblower suits have resulted in significant settlements between governmental agencies and healthcare companies 
when a private individual brings such a whistleblower suit  the defendant often will not be made aware of the lawsuit for many months or even years  until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination as to whether it will intervene 
the significant incentives and protections provided under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act increase the risk that these whistleblower suits will become more frequent 
further  it is possible that governmental entities could directly initiate investigations or litigation involving our company 
any governmental investigations of coventry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business or result in significant liabilities to our company  as well as adverse publicity 
we may be adversely affected by guaranty fund assessments under state insurance guaranty association law 
we operate in a regulatory environment that may require us to participate in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws 
life and health guaranty associations were created to protect state residents who are policyholders and beneficiaries of policies issued by a life or health insurance company which subsequently becomes insolvent 
all insurance companies with limited exceptions licensed to write life and health insurance or annuities in a state with a life and health insurance guaranty association are required to be members 
if a member insurance company becomes insolvent  the state guaranty associations continue the coverage and pay the claims under the insolvent insurer s policies and are entitled to the ongoing insurance premiums for those policies 
our exposure to guaranty fund assessments is based on our share of business we write in the relevant jurisdictions for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants 
an insolvency of an insurance company could result in an assessment  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by changes in government funding and various other risks associated with our participation in medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal government and many states from time to time consider altering the level of funding for government healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
state budget deficits could lead to changes in eligibility  coverage or other program changes in efforts to reduce medicaid funding 
mippa reduced federal spending on the medicare advantage program by billion over the period 
ppaca imposes additional cuts to the medicare advantage program of approximately billion from to and subjects plans to fee adjustments based on whether the plans meet service benchmarks and their quality rankings 
pursuant to the budget control act of the bca a bipartisan joint congressional committee was created to identify deficit reductions of at least trillion by november  because the committee failed to meet this deadline  the bca requires automatic spending reductions of trillion for federal fiscal years through  minus any deficit reductions enacted by congress and debt service costs 
however  the percentage reduction for medicare may not be more than for a fiscal year  with a uniform percentage across all medicare programs 
we cannot predict future medicare or medicaid funding levels or ensure that changes to medicare or medicaid funding will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
additional risks associated with the medicare advantage and medicare prescription drug plans include potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and or verifying enrollment  uncollectability of premiums from members  inadequacy of underwriting assumptions  inability to receive and process correct information including inabilities due to systems issues by federal and state governments or us  increased medical or pharmaceutical costs  and the underlying seasonality of this business 
if we are unable to maintain the administrative and operational capabilities to address the additional needs and increasing regulation of our medicare programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business and operating results 
in order to qualify for auto assigned enrollment of low income members  our medicare prescription drug plan bids must result in an enrollee premium below a low income regional benchmark  which is calculated by cms after all regional bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the low income regional benchmark  we may lose existing auto assigned members and will not receive additional auto assigned members in the affected regions 
our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
if these assumptions are significantly incorrect as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program  or competitors actions  our business and result of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the laws and regulations governing participation in medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal fines  civil penalties or sanctions 
in connection with our participation in medicare and medicaid programs  we contract with various third parties to perform member related services 
although our contracts with third parties require their compliance with such laws and regulations  which we in turn monitor  we could have liability for or suffer penalties due to the noncompliance of such third parties 
any fines  penalties or sanctions imposed on us as a result of noncompliance by us or the third parties with whom we contract could affect our ability to participate in medicare and medicaid programs and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  legislative or regulatory changes to the medicare and medicaid programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if the cost or complexity of medicare programs exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts during the competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could reduce revenues and adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include competition in premium or plan benefits from other health care benefit companies  reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  adverse economic conditions  our increases in premiums or benefit changes  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  legislative or regulatory changes that may affect our ability to maintain membership  negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally  and catastrophic events  including natural disasters  epidemics  man made catastrophes and other unforeseen occurrences 

table of contents our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional managed care businesses  enter into new markets and successfully integrate those businesses into our operations 
part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans and other managed care businesses 
historically  we have significantly increased our revenues through a number of acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates  obtain required governmental approvals  successfully integrate the businesses we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings 
the businesses we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability 
our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions 
in such acquisitions  we may assume liabilities that could adversely affect our business 
additionally  we may issue stock in connection with such acquisitions  which would result in dilution to existing stockholders  or we could incur debt to finance such acquisitions 
in addition  part of our growth strategy is to enter into new markets through the successful procurements of state contracts  such as our successful bid in the commonwealth of kentucky during expansion into new markets is subject to risks  including  but not limited to  our ability to establish new networks  and accurately estimate medical cost without prior experience 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to manage these risks and successfully establish a presence in any new market 
competition may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered  and cost and risk of alternatives such as self insurance  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we compete with other managed care companies that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  larger contracting scale  lower costs and or greater financial and other resources 
we also may face increased rate competition from certain blue cross plan competitors that might be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that may be deemed excessive 
in addition  by  ppaca  as enacted  will significantly expand medicaid and require states to establish a health insurance exchange which may affect competition among health plans 
we may also face additional competition from new non profit entities that are eligible for loans and grants from hhs under ppaca 
the non renewal or termination of our government contracts  unsuccessful bids for business with government agencies or the renewal of government contracts on less favorable terms could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our contracts with state government programs are subject to renewal  termination and competitive bidding procedures 
in particular  the contract between our healthcare usa subsidiary and the missouri medicaid program  mo healthnet  is subject to two successive one year extensions running through june   if mo healthnet so elects 
mo healthnet did elect to continue our second one year extension which runs from july  through june  additionally  in november  mo healthnet issued a request for proposal for the award of medicaid contracts covering the period of july through june with options to renew for two additional years 
on february   mo healthnet awarded a medicaid contract to healthcare usa through june  additionally  the contract between our coventrycares of kentucky coventry health life insurance company subsidiary and the commonwealth of kentucky medicaid program  has an initial term of three years beginning on november  the contract may be renewed at the completion of the initial contract period for four additional one year periods upon mutual agreement 
on january  the company completed its previously announced acquisition of children s mercy s family health partners  a medicaid health plan 
with this acquisition coventry assumed a contract with the state of kansas medicaid program 
this contract runs through december  the state of kansas medicaid program issued a request for proposal for the award of medicaid contracts covering the period of january  through december  with options for renewal for two additional years 

table of contents certain health plans contract directly with the federal government  specifically the opm 
our subcontracts to administer fee for service plans in the fehbp are also tied to annual contracts held between the employee organizations that sponsor those plans and opm 
these contracts are subject to annual renewals 
if we are unable to renew or successfully re bid for these and or other of our state or federal contracts  or if such contracts were terminated or renewed on less favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we cannot assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers  who typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we cannot assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner 
due to the medical loss ratio requirements imposed on our industry by ppaca  we must spend a certain percentage of every premium dollar on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expense 
hhs has issued final regulations implementing the medical loss ratio requirements that categorize agent and broker compensation as an administrative expense 
accordingly  compensation paid to independent agents and brokers will not be categorized as a healthcare medical cost or quality improvement expense in determining whether we have met the medical loss ratio requirements 
as a result  we may need to change our commission schedules in order to operate successfully in this environment  and our ability to retain and maintain the allegiance of agents and brokers may be adversely affected 
if we fail to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers we may experience higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 
in addition  our ability to contract at competitive rates with our ppo and workers compensation related providers will affect the attractiveness and profitability of our products in the national account  network rental and workers compensation businesses 
in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation 
we cannot assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally  or our company in particular  could adversely affect our results of operations or business 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to a significant amount of negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally  or our company in particular  may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  further increasing our costs of doing business and adversely affecting our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services to employers  individuals or other customers 
negative publicity relating to our company also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 

table of contents the failure to effectively protect  maintain and develop our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we depend on our information technology systems for timely and accurate information 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and report our financial results timely and accurately depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information technology systems 
our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to protect  maintain and enhance existing systems and develop and integrate new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
there can be no assurance that our process of protecting  maintaining and enhancing existing systems  developing and integrating new systems and improving service levels will not be delayed  disrupted or adversely affected by internal or external factors  or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to protect  maintain  enhance or develop our information technology systems effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves  have difficulty preventing  detecting and controlling fraud  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed  have disruptions in our business operations  have increases in administrative costs  or suffer other adverse consequences 
effective october   health plans are required by hhs to transition to the new icd coding system  which greatly expands the number and detail of diagnosis and procedure codes 
recently  cms has indicated that it will postpone the october  deadline through the rulemaking process 
transition to the new icd system requires significant investment in information technology and software as well as personnel involved in the claims review and payment process 
in addition to these upfront costs of transition to icd  it is possible that we could experience disruption or delays due to implementation issues involving our systems or the systems and implementation efforts of our business partners or our providers 
disruptions or delays in icd implementation could interrupt our operations  damage our reputation and subject us to additional costs or fines and penalties due to delays in claims processing 
in addition  we may from time to time contract and obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties 
this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such independent third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract 
the failure by an independent third party to perform could adversely affect our operations and hinder our ability to effectively maintain and use our information technology systems 
compromises of our data security could adversely affect our results of operations 
we utilize information systems that provide critical services to both our employees and our customers 
additionally  our business involves the storage and transmission of personal information  which may contain protected health information  as defined by hipaa  related to our members  payment information and confidential business information 
incidents that affect the availability  reliability  speed  accuracy  security or other proper functioning of these systems or otherwise affect the privacy and security of confidential information we store and transmit could have a significant affect on our results of operations 
any intentional or inadvertent access to our computer system could result in misappropriation of personal information  payment information or confidential business information 
an employee  contractor or other third party could possibly circumvent our security measures and could purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach of confidential information 
we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of security threats 
increased types of threats may cause us to incur increasing costs  including costs to deploy additional personnel  purchase and install protection technologies  train employees  and engage third party specialists 
any compromise of our data  including system failure  security breach  disruption by malware  loss of personal  business or other confidential information  or other damage to our system  could disrupt or delay our operations  damage our reputation and customer confidence  cause a loss of customers  and subject us to additional costs and liabilities 

table of contents we have implemented measures and taken steps designed to prevent security breaches  secure our computer systems  and protect the privacy and security of confidential information we store and transmit 
these measures include protecting our information systems through physical and software safeguards as well as backup systems considered appropriate by management 
further  we have implemented network firewalls  access technology  encryption  and intrusion detection and prevention devices to provide security for processing  transmission and storage of confidential information 
however  it is not possible to predict every potential circumstance or security risk that may arise  and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise or that our security measures will be effective 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies which could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
cms uses a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity as supported by data provided by health care providers 
as required under the risk adjustment methodology  we collect  claim  diagnosis and encounter data from providers  who are generally relied upon to appropriately code the claim submissions and document their medical records 
cms then determines the risk score and payment amount based on the health care data submitted and member demographic information 
cms periodically performs radv audits and may seek return of premium payments made to our company if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by medical record data 
beginning with the contract year  cms instituted radv audits of select medicare advantage health plans to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by the health care providers 
we estimate and record reserves for cms audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include  among other things  significant estimates related to the amount of hierarchical condition category hcc revenue subject to audit  anticipated error rates  sample methodologies  confidence intervals  enrollee selection  and payment error extrapolation methodology 
certain of the company s health plans have been selected for audit 
although we maintain reserves for our exposure to the radv audits for the cms contract years through  that we deem to be appropriate  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
accordingly  cms radv audit results could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to litigation  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories that could adversely affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of non covered benefits  vicarious liability for medical malpractice claims filed against our providers  disputes with our providers alleging rico and antitrust violations  disputes with our providers over reimbursement and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our co payment calculations  customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations  and disputes over payments for out of network benefits 

table of contents we describe certain litigation to which we are or have been a party in note m  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event a plaintiff was to obtain a significant damage award it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their effect may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
currently  professional errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary 
potential liabilities that we incur may not be covered by insurance 
further  our insurers may dispute coverage or be unable to meet their obligations  or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry  may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets and the economy in general may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes or proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness imposes certain restrictions on our business and operations 
the indentures for our senior notes and bank credit agreement impose restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions may limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness will depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate the cash necessary to service our indebtedness is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
in addition  we could be more vulnerable to economic downturns  adverse industry conditions and competitive pressures as a result of our indebtedness 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents our ability to receive cash from our regulated subsidiaries is dependent on a number of factors 
our regulated subsidiaries conduct a substantial amount of our consolidated operations 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt and fund future acquisitions depends  in part  on the amount of cash that the parent company receives from our regulated subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to the parent company will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to hmo and insurance regulations that require them to meet or exceed various capital standards and may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make cash transfers to the parent company 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying the parent company dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to the parent company  it could have a material adverse effect on the parent company s cash flow

our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
among other things  these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting  provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares  provide that amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our results of operations and stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected if we have an impairment of our intangible assets 
due largely to our past acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our total assets  as described in note a  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note e  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we perform periodic assessments of our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
this impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
fair value is calculated using a blend of a projected income and market value approach 
estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be significantly different if other assumptions and estimates were to be used 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and stockholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
this item contains forward looking statements as described in part i 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties described in part i  item a  risk factors  of this form k 
the organization of our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is as follows executive level overview critical accounting policies new accounting standards acquisitions membership results of continuing operations liquidity and capital resources other disclosures executive level overview general operations we are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in bethesda  maryland  operating health plans  insurance companies  network rental and workers compensation services companies 
through our health plan and medical services  specialized managed care  and workers compensation reportable segments  which we also refer to as divisions  we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals  employer and government funded groups  government agencies  and other insurance carriers and administrators 
summary of performance implemented a medicaid contract with the commonwealth of kentucky effective november  providing services to approximately  new members at year end 
revenues from operations increased from the prior year 
medicare part d membership decreased by  members due to a loss of auto assign regions and a reduction in the product offerings 
cash flow from operations of million 
debt to capital ratio of  an increase of from the prior year 
operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were  compared to in the prior year 
diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations of  an increase of from diluted eps from continuing operations 
repurchased million shares for million during the year 
operating revenue and products we operate health plans  insurance companies  managed care services companies and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products 
managed care premiums for our commercial risk products  for which we assume full underwriting risk  can vary 
for example  premiums for our preferred provider organization ppo and point of service pos products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the ppo and pos members 
managed care premium rates for our government programs  medicare and state sponsored managed medicaid  are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies 
these government products are offered in select markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 

table of contents revenue for our management services products non risk is generally derived from a fixed administrative fee  provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis  for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services  for which we do not assume underwriting risk 
the management services we provide typically include health care provider network management  clinical management  pharmacy benefit management pbm  bill review  claims repricing  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
operating expenses we incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk 
our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements 
medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs 
drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national pharmacy benefit manager 
drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs 
we have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary health care services  such as laboratory services and  in some cases  physician and radiology services 
a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the capitated members 
under some professional or other capitation arrangements  physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization 
we are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements 
to the extent a provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements  we will be required to perform such obligations 
consequently  we may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements 
medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately of our total medical costs for the year ended december  we have established systems to monitor the availability  appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care provided to our members by our network providers 
we collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner 
medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services 
each health plan collects data showing each physician s utilization profile for diagnostic tests  specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plan s physicians 
the medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically appropriate  cost effective services 
we incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers 
these costs are associated with fee based products 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products 
to a lesser extent  our selling  general and administrative expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services 
we operate regional service centers that perform claims processing  premium billing and collection  enrollment and customer service functions 
our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale  implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems 
cash flows we generate cash through operations 
as a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive  we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations 
our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims 
any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions  to repay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions or other changes 
due to early timing of the premium billing  we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments included on two subsequent months billings 
current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments 
based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings  historical trends  bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts  we estimate  on a monthly basis  the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly 
as of december   we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately million  compared with approximately million at december  we also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease from the prior year is due to fewer members in the calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables 
we receive premium payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a monthly basis for our medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members 
premiums are fixed subject to retroactive risk adjustment on an annual basis by contracts with cms 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and can result in adjustments to revenue 
cms uses a risk adjustment model that incorporates the use of hierarchical condition category hcc codes to determine premium payments to health plans 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the individual member diagnosis data risk scores submitted to cms 
changes in revenue from cms resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
cms periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to us if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by underlying medical record data 
we estimate and record reserves for cms audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include  among other things  significant estimates related to the amount of hcc revenue subject to audit  anticipated error rates  sample methodologies  confidence intervals  enrollee selection  and payment error extrapolation methodology 
certain of the company s health plans may be selected for audit 
although we maintain reserves for our exposure to the risk adjustment data validation radv audits  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we contract with the united states office of personnel management opm and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the office of the inspector general oig of opm  which performs periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with opm 
for our managed care contracts  the oig conducts periodic audits to  among other things  verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
for our experience rated plans  the oig focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges  the effectiveness of claims processing  financial and cost accounting systems  and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefit payments 
the oig may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans 
these audits are generally a number of years in arrears 
we estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both our managed care contracts and our experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines and historical results 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 

table of contents effective in  as required by the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  ppaca  commercial health plans with medical loss ratios mlrs on fully insured products are required to issue rebates to policyholders if the actual loss ratio falls below the target 
the mandated minimum mlr targets for health plans as calculated under the definitions in ppaca and related regulations  such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on health care medical costs and quality improvement expenses  are set at for large employer groups  for small employer groups and for individuals  subject to state specific exceptions 
the potential for and size of the rebates are measured by regulated subsidiary  state and market segment individual  small group and large group 
accordingly  in the current year  we have recorded a rebate estimate in the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities line in the accompanying balance sheet and as contra revenue in managed care premiums in the accompanying statements of operations 
we estimate the rebate liability based on judgments and estimated information  including utilization  unit cost trends  quality improvement costs  and product pricing  features and benefits 
if actual experience varies from our estimates or future regulatory guidance differs from our current judgments  the actual rebate liability could differ from our estimates 
medical claims expense and liabilities medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported 
medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider  among other things  historical claims payment patterns  provider reimbursement changes  historical utilization trends  current levels of authorized inpatient days  other medical cost inflation factors  membership levels  benefit design changes  seasonality  demographic mix change and other relevant factors 
we employ a team of actuaries that have developed  refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years 
these reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported  but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities 
these reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities 
within these models  historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates 
this information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred 
completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period 
for the more recent incurred months  the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low 
as a result  the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months 
for that reason  incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns 
instead  they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels  or trend factors 
as these months mature over time  the two estimates completion factor and trend are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months 
actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims 
actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims 
in many situations  the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate 
adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or  as we experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims 
we believe that this favorable development has been a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend 

table of contents the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands 
medical liabilities  beginning of year acquisitions reported medical costs current year prior year development total reported medical costs claim payments payments for current year payments for prior year total claim payments change in part d related subsidy liabilities medical liabilities  end of year supplemental information prior year development current year paid percent acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date 
prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs 
current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs 
the negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated 
as noted above  these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization  mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends 
medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider 
accordingly  the prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year the significant favorable unfavorable factors driving the overall favorable prior year development for include lower than anticipated medical cost increases of million 
lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of million 
lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of million 
higher than expected completion factors of million 
higher than expected inpatient hospital utilization of million 
prior year development experienced in was less favorable compared to amounts experienced in the lower favorable development is primarily due to the non renewal of the medicare pffs product 
the medicare pffs product experienced favorable reserve development during which was not experienced in the current year 
this resulted in a million reduction in favorable restatements when compared to the change in medicare part d related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represents subsidy amounts received from cms for reinsurance  coverage gap and for cost sharing related to low income individuals 
these subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies 
within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services  we use certain assumptions 
for inpatient services  authorized days are used for utilization factors  while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts 
the per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix 
for non inpatient services  a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service  provider contracts  utilization and other factors 

table of contents changes in the completion factors  trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability 
the following example in thousands  except percentages provides the estimated effect to our december  unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion  trend  and inpatient day factors 
while we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable  certain factors and actual results may differ 
completion factor claims trend factor inpatient day factor decrease increase in completion factor increase decrease in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in claims trend factor increase decrease in unpaid claims liabilities decrease increase in inpatient days increase decrease in unpaid claims liabilities we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
a regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and  if appropriate  the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience 
our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of december  by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience 
we believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december  however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
investments we account for investments in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic investments debt and equity securities 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry or geographic area  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 

table of contents for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other cases  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
we use prices from independent pricing services and  when necessary  indicative non binding quotes from independent brokers to measure the fair value of our investment securities 
we utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values  however  we generally obtain one price quote for each individual security 
we perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
examples of the procedures performed include  but are not limited to  an on going review of pricing service methodologies  review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness 
we monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active 
as further validation  we sample a security s past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates 
generally  we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services  we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in asc topic the following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at december  for these investments  the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position in thousands

the unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements 
we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before a recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities 
our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits excluding monoline insurers 
although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality  million of our  million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer 
for our mortgage backed and asset backed securities  our holdings remain at investment grade with aa and aaa ratings  respectively 
we participate in only the higher level investment tranches 
for our asset backed securities  we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill goodwill is subject to an annual assessment and periodic assessments if other indicators are present for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we performed a goodwill impairment analysis  at the reporting unit level  as of october  our annual impairment test date 
however  each year we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment 
those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  regulatory actions such as health care reform that may affect operating results  divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
for our impairment analysis we relied on both the income and market approaches 
the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
the market approach estimates the company s fair value by comparing our company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies 
the approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality 
in order to further validate the fair values determined using the income and market approach for each of our reporting units  we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization 
the objective of this comparison is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units 
in addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization  we considered factors outlined in asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  including the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available  the market price of an individual equity security and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  and the quoted market price of an individual equity security  therefore  need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit 
as of october  our market capitalization was below our book value 
we concluded that this did not affect the overall goodwill impairment analysis  as we believe our suppressed market capitalization to be primarily attributed to negative economic conditions and the enactment of health care reform 
we will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified 
we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization  the difference of which is generally referred to as an implied control premium 
we then collect data on historical control premiums that resulted from business combinations of entities of a similar size and or within our industry and concluded that our implied control premium was reasonable 
additionally  the excess of fair value over the carrying value for our reporting units ranged from to 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets  it is possible a material change could occur 
under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates  capital expenditures  discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations 
if the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results  the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 
see note e  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets  which is incorporated herein by reference 
other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  general intangibles other than goodwill  we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we have chosen october as our annual impairment testing date 
our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization is a trade name which we determined was not impaired based on the result of the october  analysis 

table of contents also in accordance with asc topic we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in  we did not incur an impairment charge related to our other intangible assets 
our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists  licenses  and provider networks 
see note e  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets  which is incorporated herein by reference 
stock based compensation expense we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
therefore  the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

the increase was also attributed to medicaid risk revenue due to new markets entered during august in the state of nebraska and the launch of the new kentucky medicaid contract  effective november  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in medicare part d revenue as a result of the loss of membership resulting from the aforementioned loss of auto assign regions and reduction in product offerings 
the increases mentioned above were also partially offset by an accrual for the minimum medical loss ratio rebate for our commercial business required by ppaca 
medical costs and cost of sales medical costs increased from the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of mhp  new medicaid risk markets entered during and  and organic membership growth and medical trends 
this was partially offset by the decrease in medicare part d membership  as noted above 
the overall total medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue  mlr  increased over the prior year to from 
the increase is primarily as a result of the minimum mlr mandates previously described as well as the mlr increases during the current year for the medicare advantage and medicaid products  as described in the segment results of operations discussion that follows 
the mlr increase was partially offset by a lower mlr during the current year for the medicare part d mlr as a result of improved performance in our basic benefit product in cost of sales increased due to continued growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the workers compensation division 
selling  general and administrative and provider class action selling  general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the addition of normal operating costs associated with mhp including  but not limited to  salaries and benefits  professional fees and premium taxes 
the increase is also due to start up costs associated with the implementation of the kentucky medicaid contract and increased marketing expenses associated with the rollout of expanded medicare products for the increase is partially offset by lower legal fees in the current year as the prior year included incremental legal fees related to the provider class action in louisiana that were not incurred in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues decreased as a result of the growth in operating revenues in the current year 
during the second quarter of  a million charge for a provider class action was recorded resulting from the court of appeal  third circuit for the state of louisiana decision to affirm the trial court s decision to grant summary judgment against a wholly owned subsidiary of coventry in provider class action litigation in louisiana state court

managed care premiums managed care premium revenue decreased as a result of our exit from the medicare pffs product line 
this exit accounted for a decline of billion in revenue in partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisitions of preferred health systems  inc phs and mhp in  an increase in revenue from medicare advantage coordinated care plans medicare advantage ccp due to an increase in membership  and an increase in medicare part d revenue due to a slightly higher premium yield in medical costs and cost of sales medical costs decreased primarily as a result of not renewing our medicare pffs product 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in medical costs as a result of the acquisitions of phs and mhp in total mlr decreased over the prior year to from as a result of the change in the mix of business resulting from the non renewal of the medicare pffs product  which had a higher mlr of

cost of sales increased due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the workers compensation division 
selling  general and administrative and provider class action selling  general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower salaries and benefits costs as well as decreased broker commissions 
the salaries and benefits costs decrease resulted from a reduction in the number of full time employees associated with the non renewal of the medicare pffs product and continued general headcount reductions 
additionally  salaries and benefits declined as a result of executive severance accruals that occurred during the prior year that did not occur in the current year 
broker commissions decreased primarily as a result of the non renewal of the medicare pffs product 
although lower in absolute terms  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased as a result of the large decrease in operating revenues in the current year associated with the non renewal of the medicare pffs product which had a high premium rate and a low relative expense level

table of contents comparison of to health plan and medical services division health plan and medical services division revenue increased for its commercial risk  medicare advantage and medicaid risk products 
this increase in commercial risk and medicare advantage is primarily due to the acquisition of mhp in october the increase in medicaid risk revenue is due to entering new markets in august in the state of nebraska and in november in the commonwealth of kentucky 
partially offsetting this increase in revenue was a decrease in commercial management services revenue due to a decline of our fehbp membership 
there was an increase in the average realized premium per member per month for the commercial risk business due to renewal rate increases 
the increase in commercial risk revenue was partially offset by the accruals for the minimum mlr rebates  discussed above 
medicare advantage revenues increased primarily due to the acquisition of mhp  as well as a general increase in premiums per member per month 
the increase in medicaid risk revenue is primarily due to the two new markets  previously described 
the medicaid risk premiums per member per month increased as a result of a rate increase effective july   in missouri  our largest medicaid market  the implementation of the kentucky contract which has a higher than average premium per member per month and due to a change in member mix in our nebraska market 
the gross margin for this division decreased for the year primarily due to lower favorable prior year medical cost development  the accrual for the minimum mlr rebate for our commercial business and a decrease in the medicare pffs gross margin 
the medicare pffs product was not renewed effective january  the medicare pffs product experienced much more favorable incurred but not reported reserve development during which was not experienced in the current year 
these decreases were offset by growth due to the acquisition of mhp  as well as organic growth in existing markets 
the commercial risk mlr increased for the year primarily due to the accruals for the minimum mlr rebates as well as utilization beginning to return to normal levels 
the medicare advantage mlr and medicaid mlr have increased for the year primarily due to utilization beginning to return to normal levels 
additionally  the medicaid mlr has increased for the year due to higher initial medical costs associated with the new kentucky business 
specialized managed care division specialized managed care division revenue decreased for the year primarily due to lower medicare part d membership as a result of the loss of auto assign regions as well as a reduction in product offerings from five in to two in including the effect of the cms risk sharing premium adjustments as well as ceded revenue  the premium per member per month was in compared to in excluding the effect of cms risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties  medicare part d premium per member per month for increased to compared to in  primarily due to pharmacy cost trends and the loss of the lower priced premium products 
when reviewing the premium yield for the medicare part d business  we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements 
when reviewing the medicare part d business  adjusting for the risk sharing amounts is useful to understand the results of the part d business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue is insignificant on a full year basis 
the decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by the medicare part d membership losses 
this is partially offset by improved mlr on the medicare part d product and improved performance in our mental health products 
the medicare part d mlr was lower than the prior year as a result of improved performance in our basic benefit product in workers compensation division workers compensation division revenue increased for the year primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program  which was partially offset by a decline in volume and rates in our network products 
workers compensation gross margin decreased slightly for the year primarily due to decline in volume and rates in our network products offset by increased volume in our pharmacy benefit management program 
the decrease was partially offset by the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program 

table of contents comparison of to health plan and medical services division health plan and medical services division revenue decreased primarily due to our exit from the medicare pffs product line which resulted in a decline of billion 
partially offsetting this decrease in revenue was an increase in revenue across each of our other risk products 
the increase in commercial risk revenue was due to the acquisitions of phs and mhp in there was an increase in the average realized premium per member per month for the commercial risk business due to renewal rate increases 
the increase in medicare advantage ccp revenue was attributable to the acquisition of mhp as well as the increase in organic membership associated with that product 
the medicare advantage premium per member per month increased in as a result of the exit from the medicare pffs product which had a lower premium rate than the medicare advantage ccp product 
the medicare pffs premium yield was lower than the medicare advantage ccp premium rate since medicare pffs typically did not include a pharmacy benefit 
the increase in medicaid revenue was attributable to commencing operations during in the nebraska and pennsylvania markets 
the medicaid premium per member per month decreased in as a result of program benefit changes in missouri  our largest medicaid market 
effective october   the pharmacy benefit was removed from the program and thus was no longer included in the missouri medicaid rate payment 
gross margin increased primarily due to the improved medical loss ratios for the health plan commercial risk and medicare advantage ccp products 
the commercial risk mlr decreased primarily due to the lower than expected utilization trends and more benign flu season than the medicare advantage ccp mlr decrease resulted from lower than expected utilization trends and demographic changes within the product 
partially offsetting these increases in gross margin was a decrease in gross margin resulting from our exit from the medicare pffs product 
specialized managed care division specialized managed care division revenue increased primarily due to an increase in medicare part d revenue which resulted from the higher membership volumes in the early portion of including the effect of the cms risk sharing premium adjustments as well as ceded revenue  the premium per member per month was in compared to in excluding the effect of cms risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties  medicare part d premium per member per month for increased to compared to in  primarily due to pharmacy cost trends 
the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved mlr for the medicare part d product in compared to the improvement in mlr was primarily attributed to improved performance in our mainstream products which make up the majority of our part d business 
workers compensation division revenue in the workers compensation division decreased slightly primarily due to a decline in volume in our network and clinical programs  partially offset by the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program 
workers compensation gross margin decreased due to declines in our network and clinical program volumes  which are higher margin products  partially offset by increases attributable to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs 
premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned  and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period  typically to days after the date such medical services are rendered 
the lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth 
as a result  we typically hold approximately one to two months of float 
in addition  accumulated earnings provide further liquidity 
our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal 
the fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of aa and an effective duration of years as of december  typically  the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities 

table of contents our cash and investments  consisting of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations  risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business 
see part i  item a  risk factors  in this form k for more information 
management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations  cash and investments on hand  and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  capital expenditures  debt interest costs  debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements 
in addition  our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits 
cash flows operating activities net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was an inflow as a result of net earnings generated by our normal operations during the period  net of adjustments to earnings  an increase in medical liabilities primarily due to the implementation of our kentucky medicaid contract and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities related to minimum mlr rebate accruals 
offsetting these inflows is an increase in other receivables related to the timing of settlement of current year subsidy receivables for our medicare business due from cms that we expect to receive in additionally  offsetting these inflows was million paid to settle the provider class action litigation in louisiana 
for additional information regarding the provider class action matter  refer to note m  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financials statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
our net cash from operating activities in increased million from the corresponding period 
the increase was primarily a result of the unusually low cash flows in the prior year due to payments of medical claims liabilities associated with run out of the medicare pffs product 
the nature of our business is such that premium revenues are generally received in advance of the expected cash payment for the related medical costs 
this results in strong cash inflows upon the implementation of a benefit program and cash outflows upon the termination 
partially offsetting these increased inflows are the increase in current year subsidy receivables for our medicare part d business due from cms and million paid to settle the provider class action litigation in louisiana 
our net cash from operating activities in was million lower than the period as period reflected the medical claim payments associated with the medicare pffs product run out 
during  we experienced large positive cash flows from operating activities primarily due to membership growth across the medicare products 
investing activities capital expenditures in of approximately million consisted primarily of computer hardware  software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational systems 
projected capital expenditures in of approximately to million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and other equipment 
net cash from investing activities for the year ended december  was an outflow primarily due to a large amount of investment purchases during the period 
this outflow was partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of investments 
financing activities net cash from financing activities was an outflow  primarily due to share repurchases during the year ended december  and the repayment of the million outstanding balance on the previous revolving credit facility  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the notes  net of discount and issuance costs 
our board of directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
as a part of this program  million shares were purchased in at an aggregate cost of million  no shares were repurchased in and million shares were purchased in at an aggregate cost of million 
as of december   the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is million 
excluded from these share repurchase program amounts are shares purchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding obligations as these purchases are not part of the program 

table of contents on june   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility agreement in the principal amount of million 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
in january  at maturity  we repaid the million outstanding balance of our senior notes

health plans our regulated hmo and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities 
during  we received million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and we made million in capital contributions to them 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has proposed that states adopt risk based capital rbc standards which are a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the managed care organization s rbc is calculated by applying factors to various assets  premiums and reserve items 
the factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items 
the adequacy of a managed care organization s actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its rbc as determined by the formula 
our health plans are required to submit a rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
regulators will use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions that could take place  if any  range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels  to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a rbc policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level  which is currently equal to of their rbc 
some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance 
the table below summarizes our statutory reserve information  as of december  and in millions  except percentage data 
unaudited regulated capital and surplus of rbc excess capital and surplus above of rbc capital and surplus as percentage of rbc statutory deposits rbc amounts are not audited 
the decrease in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from dividends paid to the parent company partially offset by net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company 
we believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments  we had cash and investments of approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the increase primarily resulted from the issuance of the notes discussed previously  dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries  and earnings generated from our non regulated entities 
this is partially offset by share repurchases  repayment of debt related to our revolving credit facility  a cash payment related to the provider class action litigation in louisiana and capital contributions made by the parent company

we have typically paid to of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred 
we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and  accordingly  have been excluded from the table above 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments 
other disclosures legislation and regulation as a managed health care company  we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services 
the laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory  regulatory and administrative powers 
these laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans 
managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented 
likewise  interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change

inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations in which we assume underwriting risk  we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under an investment policy approved by our board of directors  we invest primarily in marketable us government and agency  state  municipal  mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
our investment policy and guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade 
our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and  if in our best interest  such investments were not disposed within days after acquisition 
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of first health group corporation fhgc 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
we are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolio s duration and mix of securities 
we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration  federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities 
investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry or geographic area  the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other cases  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis
