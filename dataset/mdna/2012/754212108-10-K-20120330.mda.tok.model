results of operations fiscal versus fiscal the company posted record sales  operating income  net income  and diluted earnings per share for fiscal these levels resulted in large part from higher demand for applied technology s products due to a strong agriculture market and international expansion 
in addition  the high crude oil prices resulted in increased drilling  which drove growth of pit liner sales into the energy market for engineered films 
the increase in net sales is the result of year over year sales growth in applied technology  engineered films  aerostar and electronic systems 
fiscal operating income increased from fiscal primarily due to sales growth 
applied technology increased its operating income by due to higher sales and associated operating leverage 
aerostar posted an increase in operating income of from the prior year due to higher sales and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
electronic systems operating income rose due to a more favorable product mix and higher sales 
operating income growth of in engineered films trailed sales growth in that segment  primarily due to higher material costs 
for the first nine months of fiscal  increased material costs outpaced the favorable impact of higher sales and increased pricing 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal fiscal net sales rose to million and diluted earnings increased to per share as a result of sales growth in all operating segments applied technology  engineered films  aerostar  and electronic systems 
fiscal operating income increased from the prior year due to the increase in net sales and improved margins from the recession impacted year of fiscal strategic investments in january  the company completed the stock purchase agreement for all the outstanding stock of vista research  inc vista for a purchase price of million  of which million was cash  million was on assumed line of credit paid by raven at closing  and million was valued in contingent consideration and earn outs 
vista is a leading provider of surveillance systems that enhance the effectiveness of radars using sophisticated algorithms 
vista s smart sensing radar systems ssrs are employed in a host of advanced detection and tracking applications  including wide area surveillance for the border patrol and the military 
in the short term  this acquisition will allow raven to enhance its tethered aerostat security solutions within its aerostar division 
longer term  the company is positioned to meet growing global demand for low cost detection and tracking systems used by government and law enforcement agencies 
results of operations subsequent to the acquisition have been combined into the aerostar division 
cash flow and payments to shareholders the company continues to generate strong operating cash flows and maintain a strong capital base 
capital expenditures totaled a record million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capital spending consisted primarily of expenditures related to increased manufacturing capacity in engineered films  a new manufacturing facility in applied technology and aerostar s commitment to a higher level of product development investments in future growth  including facilities and equipment 
during fiscal  million was returned to shareholders though quarterly dividends 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the quarterly dividend was raised from cents per share to cents per share  representing the th consecutive annual increase in the dividend excluding special dividends 
during fiscal  million was returned to shareholders through quarterly dividends totaling million  or cents per share  and a special dividend of million  or per share 
a special dividend was paid on september  in response to the company s strong cash position and commitment to return excess cash to shareholders 
performance measures the company continues to generate positive returns on net sales  average assets and beginning equity  which are important gauges of raven s ability to efficiently produce profits 
raven generated a record return on sales in fiscal as the company continues to capitalize on competitive advantages in niche markets

financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million was up million versus fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million grew million and operating income of million rose million versus fourth quarter fiscal a number of factors contributed to the strong full year and fourth quarter comparative results market conditions 
global market fundamentals were healthy as population and income growth in emerging economies have increased demand for food  while natural disasters and adverse weather conditions have restricted supplies 
these factors have resulted in higher crop prices and wider acceptance of precision agriculture as a sound investment for maximizing yields and controlling input costs 
sales volume and selling prices 
the increase in net sales was driven by higher sales volume  as selling prices reflected only a modest increase year over year 
the favorable year over year comparisons reflect strong sales growth across the majority of the division s product offerings  including application controls ie control systems  flow meters  valves  field computers  guidance and steering products and boom controls 
international sales 
net sales outside the us accounted for of segment sales in fiscal versus for fiscal international sales of million in fiscal increased million  or year over year as improved farm fundamentals drove strong overall demand in brazil  and to a lesser extent  eastern europe  canada  south africa  and australia 
new customers have also contributed to the international sales growth  reflecting the segment s current and past investment to expand its geographical presence 
gross margins 
gross margins of in fiscal improved from in fiscal due to higher sales volume and operating leverage on profitability 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses were of net sales in fiscal  compared to for the prior year 
although spending for r d and business development efforts increased million versus the prior year  such spending declined as a percentage of net sales  due to the significant growth in net sales 
fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million was up million versus fiscal several factors contributed to the strong full year comparative results market conditions 
us farm fundamentals were strong as commodity prices corn  soybeans and other feed grains remained above historical levels 
in addition  global market conditions were healthy as population and income growth in emerging economies continued to spur increased demand for food 
sales volume and selling prices 
fiscal sales growth was driven by higher volume and modest selling price increases 
the growth in volume reflects solid year over year demand for slingshot  application controls and guidance and steering products 
new product sales 
year to date new product sales reflected the success of slingshot an information platform which improves data collection  transmission  storage and analysis and provides rtk correction of gps signals for high accuracy steering solutions 
international sales 
net sales outside the us accounted for of segment sales in fiscal versus in fiscal international sales of million rose million year over year led by strong slingshot demand in canada 
economic growth and strong farm fundamentals in argentina and brazil drove strong overall demand in south america 
this growth was partially offset by a decrease in australian sales due to weak market conditions 
gross margins 
gross margins of in fiscal rose from in fiscal due to the positive effect of higher sales and strong operating leverage on profitability 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses decreased from of sales in fiscal to in fiscal strong sales and growth opportunities drove a million increase in selling expenses and research and development expenses increased million to support product development and strategic initiatives

financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income a operating margins a includes a pre tax gain on the disposition of assets 
fiscal net sales of million increased million while operating income of million was up million versus fiscal the year over year changes were driven primarily by the following factors market conditions 
economic growth in emerging markets continued to support higher oil prices  and in turn  increased drilling activity and demand for pit liners in the energy market 
sales volume and selling prices 
sales growth for fiscal was predominately driven by the increased demand for pit liners utilized in oil and gas exploration activity 
environmental and water conservation projects increased the demand for geomembrane containment liners and covers during fiscal new product sales of feedfresh and fumigation films contributed to the year over year sales increase in the agriculture market 
selling prices increased approximately during fiscal  reflecting higher material costs as compared with one year ago 
sales volume  as measured by pounds shipped  was up year over year 
gross margin decline 
full year gross margins declined percentage points  despite the sales growth 
the lower gross margin was attributable to higher resin costs that were not fully offset by increased selling prices in the first nine months of the year 
operating expenses 
fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to  compared to in the prior year  excluding the million gain on disposition of assets 
the increase in selling expense of million lagged the increase in sales  however  a year over year increase in r d spending of million contributed to the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
higher r d spending reflects one of the segment s key performance goals of expanding its product development efforts 
fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million grew million and operating income of million rose million versus fourth quarter fiscal several factors contributed to the strong fourth quarter comparative results sales volume and selling price 
fourth quarter fiscal sales to the energy and geomembrane markets increased above levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to market conditions discussed above and increased capacity as new extrusion equipment was brought on line in the fourth quarter to meet demand 
selling prices and sales volume  as measured by pounds shipped  increased and  respectively compared to fourth quarter fiscal gross margin 
gross margins increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal to compared to in the prior year fourth quarter 
the increase in the margin was due to the higher sales volume and the resulting positive operating leverage and to a more favorable ratio of selling prices to input costs 
fiscal net sales of million increased million while operating income of million was up million versus fiscal fiscal results were primarily driven by the following factors improved market conditions 
business activity and confidence rose as credit markets improved and asset values stabilized 
crude oil prices rose to levels adequate to support increased drilling activity and strengthened energy market demand for pit liners 
similarly  as credit began flowing and economic uncertainty diminished  the construction and agriculture markets rose from recessionary levels 
sales volume and selling prices 
input cost increases drove a increase in selling prices 
sales volume  as measured by pounds shipped  increased over  as engineered films largest markets  energy and construction  rebounded from prior year depressed levels 
recovery of crude oil prices from their lows in early calendar drove additional oil and gas drilling activity and increased demand for pit liners as sales to the energy market more than doubled 
sales of industrial and construction films rose double digits 
deliveries of agriculture films rose more than 
sales of feedfresh silage covers gained traction due to healthy farm conditions and broadened appreciation of the value added benefits of this highly engineered film 
grain cover sales improved year over year due to strong yields and a short harvest cycle 
capacity utilization 
full year operating margins expanded from to as a result of improved capacity utilization 
operating expenses 
full year operating expenses were of sales in fiscal versus in fiscal the increase in selling expenses of million lagged the increase in sales 
research and development expenses were flat year over year 
aerostar aerostar manufactures military parachutes  protective wear  custom shaped inflatable products and high altitude and tethered aerostats for government and commercial research 
financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million over fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million increased million and operating income of million increased million versus fiscal fourth quarter 
fiscal full year and fourth quarter comparative results were primarily attributable to the following sales volumes 
net sales for fiscal increased million from the prior year  mainly due to higher t parachute and spare parts deliveries and additional protective wear sales  offset by a decrease in tethered aerostat sales 
the fourth quarter sales increase of was largely impacted by the parachute and protective wear revenue growth and increased tethered aerostat sales 
volatility in aerostat deliveries 
the company continued to see volatility in the delivery of aerostats which impact comparative results 
aerostat sales by fiscal quarters were million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
gross margin improvement 
gross margins improved to compared to in the prior year 
gross margin expansion on t parachutes resulted from manufacturing efficiencies and higher sales volume but was partially offset by a change in product mix 
aerostat sales  which carry a relatively higher margin  accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses of million or of sales increased million from million or of sales as a result of higher investment in research and development to support next generation aerostat technology and the development of lighter but stronger materials  along with higher selling and business development expense to expand the tethered aerostat business 
fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million over fiscal fiscal results were driven by the following tethered aerostats 
aerostar capitalized on strong demand from the us military for persistent ground surveillance systems to be deployed in afghanistan 
volatility in aerostat deliveries 
sequentially  fiscal quarterly sales of aerostats varied materially million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter as design changes and funding shifts have impacted the timing of deliveries 
military parachutes 
fiscal parachute revenue increased over as the t parachutes ramped to full production and deliveries under the t spares contract began 
gross margins 
full year gross margins improved year over year 
the negative effect of t parachute start up costs in the first half of the year and increased overhead was partially offset by a more favorable product mix as the relative contribution of tethered aerostats to total sales grew 
operating expenses 
operating expenses of million or of sales increased million from million or of sales as a result of higher selling expenses and significant investments in research and development primarily to support aerostat development 
electronic systems electronic systems is a total solutions provider of electronics manufacturing services  primarily to north american original equipment manufacturers 
financial highlights for the fiscal years ended january  dollars in thousands change change net sales gross profit gross margins operating income operating margins fiscal net sales of million increased million  and operating income of million grew million  from fiscal fiscal fourth quarter net sales of million increased million and operating income of million increased million over fourth quarter fiscal the following factors affected fiscal full year and fourth quarter comparative results sales volume 
fiscal net sales increased year over year  primarily due to additional intercompany sourcing of assemblies to the applied technology division and increased sales of hand held bed controls 
avionics deliveries were down year over year  reflecting the planned ending of certain programs this year 
fourth quarter fiscal net sales were favorably impacted by increased secure communication electronic shipments and hand held bed control deliveries compared to the same period a year ago 
gross margins 
year over year gross margins improved to from due to positive operating leverage from increased sales volume and favorable product mix 
fourth quarter fiscal gross margins of were up from from in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to increased sales volume 
operating expenses 
fiscal operating expenses were million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the year over year increase is due to higher selling expenses 
fiscal net sales of million increased million and operating income of million grew million from fiscal fiscal full year comparative results reflected the following sales volume 
fiscal revenue was positively impacted by avionics growth and increased sourcing of assemblies to applied technology partially offset by weaker deliveries of circuit boards for secure communication devices 
profit margins 
product mix had a favorable impact on full year operating margins 
operating expenses 
fiscal operating expenses were relatively unchanged from fiscal levels 
corporate expenses administrative expenses  other income expense  net  and income taxes for the years ended january dollars in thousands administrative expenses administrative expenses as a of sales other income expense  net effective tax rate administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal investments in additional finance  human resources and information technology personnel to support current and future growth strategies through a strengthened corporate infrastructure accounted for the majority of the increased spending 
higher professional services spending related to the vista acquisition and other business and strategic initiatives also contributed to the increase 
administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal  driven by increased headcount and higher incentive compensation 
other income expense  net consists mainly of interest income  foreign currency transaction gain or loss  and activity related to the company s equity investment in sst 
the year over year variability is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates 
the fiscal effective tax rate increased slightly compared with fiscal due to a lower us federal tax deduction from income attributable to manufacturing activities 
outlook raven has been investing to achieve growth that will average over the long term  with opportunities to exceed that objective and an understanding that it will not meet that target every year 
management believes double digit growth in fiscal is possible  and sees a wide range of possible results for aerostar 
the profit effect of expected sales growth is projected to be partially offset by higher investments in new product development and infrastructure 
in addition to the r d investment levels  raven will continue to explore opportunities to grow its businesses through acquisition and expansion activities 
applied technology applied technology expects to build on its investments in international growth and integration of hardware and software solutions to improve agricultural efficiency 
the development of an industry leading decision support system helps position applied technology as a premier total precision solutions provider gps steering devices  planting and spraying controls  data collection  transmission  storage and analysis 
worldwide agriculture conditions are expected to remain healthy for this segment  with rising global demand for food  heightened environmental concerns and broadening recognition of raven s suite of productivity tools as a cost effective investment 
these factors could drive sales growth to the range in fiscal profitability growth could be tempered by investments in new initiatives  both from a product development and geographic expansion perspective 
engineered films management anticipates sales growth of to be driven by increased capacity and capabilities 
demand  especially for energy and geomembrane films  continues to have a positive outlook 
crude oil prices continue to drive oil and gas drilling activities and demand for pit liners 
the impact of transient factors  such as civil unrest in oil producing countries and speculation on the price of crude oil is uncertain  but long term needs remain 
new extrusion equipment put into service in the fourth quarter of fiscal completed the second phase of its expansion  increasing total tonnage capacity by approximately over the last two years 
the ramp up period for new equipment has typically taken years  depending on market conditions 
management expects operating income growth to slightly exceed anticipated sales growth due to an improving spread of selling prices over the cost of plastic resins and higher utilization of the new extrusion equipment  partially offset by higher depreciation and investment spending for research and product development 
aerostar management believes the addition of vista surveillance technologies will bring new innovations for detecting and tracking small objects over the land  on the water and in the air 
raven solutions can replace or enhance traditional  high cost radar systems used today 
new opportunities in tethered aerostats to provide cost effective persistent surveillance for the military will be critical to aerostar s success 
similar to this past year  deliveries could vary significantly by quarter as orders are dependent on the government funding process 
management believes with a full year of vista revenue  and growth in military parachutes and protective wear  aerostar revenue growth of is possible in the upcoming year 
at this point  aerostar s outlook is impacted by uncertainty in the funding of new projects by the us government 
despite strong interest  at this point  order backlog is minimal for aerostats and surveillance systems 
aerostar sales in the first quarter are now expected to decline over the previous year 
aerostar s gross profit rates are expected to decline by about percentage points in fiscal due to the change in revenue mix  with vista service revenues carrying a lower gross profit rate than product sales 
electronic systems management looks at electronic systems as a complementary business to its growth divisions engineered films  aerostar and applied technology 
this business carries technical expertise that support the efforts of its sister divisions and provides electronic manufacturing services to low volume high mix customers that require high levels of service and engineering support 
the mid to long term growth strategy is predicated on the development of proprietary products  expansion of the customer base and continued in sourcing of assemblies for raven s other divisions 
fiscal results are expected to be in line with fiscal results as the impact of lower avionics sales is substantially offset by higher deliveries to other raven divisions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a strong capital base 
management focuses on the current cash balance and operating cash flows in considering liquidity  as operating cash flows have historically been raven s primary source of liquidity 
management expects that current cash  combined with the generation of positive operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
raven s cash needs are seasonal  with working capital demands strongest in the first quarter 
as a result  the discussion of trends in operating cash flows focuses on the primary drivers of year over year variability in working capital 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at january   a million decrease from million on the same date in in january  the company made an million net payment for the acquisition of vista research  inc raven has an uncollateralized credit agreement that provides a million line of credit  with a balance of zero at january  the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of january  the credit line  which matures on september   is expected to be renewed during fiscal operating activities operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from customers  which is offset by cash payments for inventories  services  employee compensation and income taxes 
management evaluates working capital levels through the computation of average days sales outstanding and inventory turnover 
average days sales outstanding is a measure of the company s efficiency in enforcing its credit policy 
the inventory turnover ratio is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of inventory management  with further consideration given to balancing the disadvantages of excess inventory with the risk of delayed customer deliveries 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in operating cash flows is the result of higher company earnings  depreciation expense  and deferred income taxes  partially offset by increased working capital to support growth 
in fiscal  inventory and accounts receivable consumed million of cash versus million in fiscal the company s inventory turnover rate declined slightly from the prior year due to higher raw material inventory levels to support increased sales trailing month inventory turn of x in fiscal versus x in fiscal 
cash collections continue to be efficient  with the trailing month days sales outstanding of days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal year over year variability in accounts payable consumed million of cash in fiscal compared to cash generated of million in fiscal due to timing of payments 
in fiscal  the change in deferred income taxes contributed million of additional operating cash flow due primarily to the deferral of tax liabilities resulting from bonus depreciation taken on qualified capital expenditures 
in fiscal  inventory consumed million of cash versus cash generated of million in fiscal  reflecting higher raw material costs  higher forecasted demand  delayed deliveries at electronic systems and purchases of plastic resins at engineered films in anticipation of price increases 
similarly  accounts receivable consumed cash of million in fiscal versus cash generated of million in fiscal  reflecting higher receivables associated with sales growth  particularly sales of engineered films and tethered aerostats 
disciplined inventory management inventory turnover of x in fiscal versus x in fiscal and improved cash collections average days sales outstanding of days in fiscal versus days in fiscal contributed to stronger cash flows 
year over year variability in accounts payable and accrued liabilities generated million in cash  as compared with cash inflows of million in fiscal this reflected an increase in accounts payable commensurate with the rise in inventory and higher incentive compensation accruals associated with strong profits 
investing activities cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures totaled a record million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capital spending consisted primarily of expenditures related to increased manufacturing capacity in engineered films  a new manufacturing facility in applied technology and aerostar s commitment to a higher level of product development investments in future growth  including facilities and equipment 
capital outlay for payments related to business acquisitions was million in fiscal  primarily related to the vista acquisition 
management anticipates record capital spending in fiscal  in the million range 
in addition  management will evaluate strategic acquisitions that result in expanded capabilities and solidify competitive advantages 
as part of the company s investment in corporate infrastructure  raven will be investing approximately million over a year period to renovate its downtown sioux falls facility headquarters 
expansion of engineered films capacity and applied technology s manufacturing and research and development facility are expected to continue 
financing activities cash used in financing activities is primarily for dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 
financing activities consumed cash of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal quarterly dividends paid in fiscal were million  or per share  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  the company increased the quarterly dividend rate excluding special dividends for the th consecutive year 
raven has now paid a dividend in consecutive years 
in fiscal  the company paid a special dividend of million  or per share 
cash outflow for repayment of a line of credit in fiscal totaled million 
this represents a payment to close a line of credit assumed as part of the vista acquisition in january no borrowings were made on the line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of january   the company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its non cancelable operating leases for facilities and equipment and unconditional purchase obligations  primarily for raw materials  in the amounts listed below 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations other than the items noted in the following table 
in addition to the commitments noted there  standby letters of credit totaling million have been issued  primarily to support self insured workers compensation bonding requirements 
in the event the bank chooses not to renew the company s line of credit  the letters of credit would cease and alternative methods of support for the insurance obligations would be necessary  would be more expensive and would require additional cash outlays 
management believes the chances of this are remote 
a summary of the obligations and commitments at january  and for the next five years is shown below 
dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations line of credit a operating leases unconditional purchase obligations postretirement benefits b acquisition related contingent payments c uncertain tax positions d a million line bears interest at as of january  and expires september the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million at january  b postretirement benefits amounts represent expected payments on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
c amounts reflect the future milestone and earn out payments with the vista and ranchview acquisition 
actual payments on these obligations may vary from the recorded balance since the total payment amount due depends upon certain future conditions 
see below for further detail on the specific obligations 
d the total liability for uncertain tax positions at january  was million 
the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments relating to non current tax benefits 
acquisition related obligations the company has entered into future obligations for milestone and earn out payments associated with the ranchview and vista acquisitions 
in connection with the vista stock purchase agreement  the company has agreed to pay million upon the total receipt of smart sensing radar systems ssrs orders for delivery of a specific quantity by january  and another million upon the delivery of the total specific ssrs quantity by january  no amount would be paid if the specific milestones are not reached by the specific dates 
the company will also make annual payments to the previous owners based upon earn out percentages on specific revenue streams until january   not to exceed million 
lastly  the company has agreed to fund a revenue based bonus pool for vista employees using those same earn out percentages on specific revenue streams until january   also not to exceed million 
the company has not paid any amount on these obligation as of january  for the ranchview acquisition  raven agreed to pay additional consideration on a quarterly basis of on future sales of ranchview products  up to a maximum payment of million 
as of january   the company has paid a total of million on this obligation since acquisition 
the total liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  related to these future obligations was million  of which million is classified as accrued liabilities and million as other liabilities 
these liabilities primarily represent the present value of milestone and earn out payments classified as consideration at the acquisition date 
payments related to the vista employee revenue based bonus pool were treated as a separate transaction from the acquisition and will be accrued when the specific revenue stream is recorded 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting policies are those that require the application of judgment when valuing assets and liabilities on the company s balance sheet 
these policies are discussed below  because a fluctuation in actual results versus expected results could materially affect operating results and because the policies require significant judgments and estimates to be made 
accounting related to these policies is initially based on best estimates at the time of original entry in the accounting records 
adjustments are periodically recorded when the company s actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
these adjustments could be material if experience were to change significantly in a short period of time 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  raven has used derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions that are denominated in currency other than its functional currency  which is the us dollar 
the use of these financial instruments had no material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inventories the company estimates inventory valuation each quarter 
typically  when a product reaches the end of its lifecycle  inventory value declines slowly or the product has alternative uses 
management uses its manufacturing resources planning data to help determine if inventory is slow moving or has become obsolete due to an engineering change 
the company closely reviews items that have balances in excess of the prior year s requirements  or that have been dropped from production requirements 
despite these reviews  technological or strategic decisions made by management or raven s customers may result in unexpected excess material 
electronic systems typically has recourse to customers for obsolete or excess material 
when electronic systems customers authorize inventory purchases  especially with long lead time items  they are required to take delivery of unused material or compensate the company accordingly 
in every raven operating unit  management must manage obsolete inventory risk 
the accounting judgment ultimately made is an evaluation of the success that management will have in controlling inventory risk and mitigating the impact of obsolescence when it does occur 
warranties estimated warranty liability costs are based on historical warranty costs and average time elapsed between purchases and returns for each business segment 
warranty issues that are unusual in nature are accrued for individually 
allowance for doubtful accounts determining the level of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses based on historical writeoff experience by segment and an estimate of the collectibility of any known problem accounts 
factors that are considered beyond historical experience include the length of time the receivables are outstanding  the current business climate and the customer s current financial condition 
revenue recognition estimated returns or sales allowances are recognized upon shipment of a product 
the company sells directly to customers or distributors that incur the expense and commitment for any post sale obligations beyond stated warranty terms 
goodwill and long lived assets management assesses goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired  using fair value measurement techniques 
for goodwill  raven performs impairment reviews by reporting units which are the company s reportable segments 
the company has the option to perform a qualitative impairment assessment over relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
certain events and circumstances reviewed are macroeconomics  industry conditions  cost inputs  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount  then no further goodwill impairment testing is needed 
if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  or the company does not elect to do the qualitative assessment  then the company must perform step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 
in the first step of goodwill impairment testing  the corporate discount rate is calculated so that the discounted cash flows are equal to raven s net enterprise value 
the corporate discount rate is then increased when evaluating any individual reporting unit due to any additional risk factors inherent within the unit versus the corporation as a whole 
a discounted cash flow analysis is then completed for the reporting unit using the adjusted discount rate 
the discounted cash flow assumptions primarily include forecasted sales and costs and the discount rate 
management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is then compared with its net assets 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net assets of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is possible and a more refined measurement of the impairment loss would take place 
this is the second step of the goodwill impairment testing  in which management may use market comparisons and recent transactions to assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the valuation methodologies in both steps of goodwill impairment testing use significant estimates and assumptions  which include projected future cash flows including timing and the risks inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for long lived assets  including definite life intangibles  investments in affiliates  and property  plant and equipment  management tests for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated lives of the assets using accelerated methods  which reduces the likelihood of an impairment loss 
management periodically discusses any significant changes in the utilization of long lived assets  which may result from  but are not limited to  an adverse change in the asset s physical condition or a significant adverse change in the business climate
