item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview our net revenue was   and million in   and  respectively 
we generated net income of   and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
our net revenue consists primarily of sales of our power management semiconductor products 
when evaluating our net revenue  we categorize our sales into three major markets servers and storage  networking and communications  and consumer and portable 
as disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   as filed with the sec on march   we have simplified the number of markets we use to evaluate net revenue  and sales in the previously reported desktop and workstation market are now reported in our consumer and portable market 
the electronics manufacturing industry is complex and disaggregated  and electronic system producers typically utilize distributors and outsourced suppliers to provide procurement  manufacturing  design  and other supply chain related services within the industry 
we attempt to quantify the amount of sales within the major markets identified above  but such quantified amounts are approximations only  as we must rely upon estimates and assumptions regarding the incorporation of our products sold to distributors or other outsourced suppliers into the systems of the oems  odms  cems  or merchant power supply manufacturers for each particular market 
in  we estimate that of our net revenue was derived from sales in the server and storage market  from the consumer and portable market and from the networking and communications market 
we believe that the most significant portion of our revenues in the upcoming fiscal year will continue to be derived from sales in the server and storage market 
our sales and accounts receivable are currently concentrated with a small group of customers  and we expect this to continue in the future 
in  ibm corp  hon hai precision industry co  silicon application corp 
and flextronics manufacturing hong kong ltd each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue and of our accounts receivable 
in  ibm corp 
and hon hai precision industry co  each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue and of our accounts receivable 
while we report revenue for direct sales to particular customers  our sales data may not accurately reflect the additional indirect demand from distributors and outsourced suppliers who purchase our products pursuant to their business relationships with these same customers 
because we have less visibility into and are not able to quantify this indirect demand  we are unable to determine how much additional revenue these customers may generate 
in addition  our sales data also may not identify customers who do not directly account for of our net revenue  but may be significant in that such customers also generate substantial indirect demand from distributors and outsourced suppliers 
if any such customer were to stop incorporating our products or third party products containing our components into its designs  we would not only lose the direct revenue we receive from the customer  but we could also lose a portion of the indirect revenue from third parties who do business with such customer 
if we were to lose or experience a significant reduction in demand from one or more of our key customers either to which we sell directly or which generates indirect demand or if we were to fail to collect our accounts receivable from one or more of our key customers  our operating results and financial position would be materially adversely impacted 
because demand for our products is impacted by demand for our customers products  our revenue depends on the timing  size  and speed of commercial introductions of systems that use our products  and our customers ability to manage their inventory in relationship to such demand 
we continue to expect a significant amount of 
table of contents our revenue to come from the commercial introduction of new systems  which is often more difficult to forecast than ongoing demand for previously introduced systems 
a number of our customers applications  particularly in the consumer and portable market  are subject to short product cycles and prone to delays in development and commercial introduction or significant changes in demand  making it inherently difficult to accurately forecast demand for such applications in any period 
a number of our customers  such as odms  cems  and merchant power supply manufacturers  also are dependent upon the demand of other companies  which makes sales to such parties more difficult to forecast accurately 
these fluctuations in demand could materially affect our operating results on a period by period basis 
we recognize revenue on our sales upon shipment with a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances 
a portion of our revenues comes from customer orders that are both received and shipped against within the same quarter  or turns business  which is inherently difficult to forecast 
we estimate turns business as a percent of net revenue as the ratio of net revenue less beginning backlog to net revenue making adjustments for the effect of sales return reserves or other adjustments to net revenue not included in backlog 
turns business was between and in the fourth quarter of and if our turns business increases  forecasting revenue becomes more difficult 
generally  our current sales practice allows customers to  and customers routinely do  revise and cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates on relatively short notice pursuant to changes in the customer s requirements 
in addition  in circumstances where we have achieved our objectives in a period or when we have limited or insufficient inventory available  we may delay shipment of orders 
for these reasons  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
we typically sell directly through our internal sales force to customers in north america 
we sell both directly and indirectly through distributors internationally  under agreements that generally do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide limited return rights in the event of product failure 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
sales to international distributors represented of net revenue in and we expect the sales channels we use and the mix of business between distribution and direct sales to change as our product offerings and customers evolve 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of purchases of silicon wafers and related costs of assembly  test and shipment of our products  and compensation and related costs of personnel and equipment associated with production management and quality assurance 
our gross margins have historically varied significantly  and may continue to vary  based on a variety of factors  including changes in the relative mix of the products we sell  the markets and geographies where we sell  the size and nature of our customers in these markets  the levels of sales to distributors  manufacturing volumes and yields  discounts or other financial incentives to customers and inventory and overhead costs 
generally  as we introduce new products  we initially incur higher unit production costs  and as the product ramp progresses  our overall unit production costs decrease as manufacturing efficiency improves 
in addition  because our power management products are highly complex and the manufacturing process for our products is technically challenging  previously undetected design defects and minor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields or quality 
such decreases in yields or quality can impact our gross margins due to a reduction in our revenue as a result of significant product returns  may cause us to incur product replacement costs  and may cause us to rework or scrap inventory that had been manufactured with the defect 
if we are unable to manage these risks  our revenue and gross margins and financial position may be materially adversely impacted 
finally  consistent with the overall market for power management solutions  we expect to face price pressure over time 
in order to maintain or improve our gross margins  we will need to introduce new  lower cost products  increase volumes  reduce unit costs or achieve a combination of these objectives 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
as lead times at our manufacturing vendors can be up to three months or more  we typically build inventory based on our sales forecasts rather than customers orders  subjecting us to inventory risk 
if  after initial orders are placed  we change certain features of our product to accommodate customer requirements  we may create additional inventory that we may not be able to sell 
in the event of an inventory write down either because the inventory exceeds demand  becomes obsolete  or contains previously undetected defects and must be reworked or scrapped  our gross margins could be materially adversely impacted 
on the other hand  because our manufacturing lead times tend to be longer than 
table of contents our order lead times and capacity at our manufacturing vendors may be constrained  our net revenue and relationship with our customers could be adversely impacted if we do not have adequate inventory available to meet customer demand 
our inventory levels were million at the end of the fourth quarter of  and inventory turns  calculated as our annualized cost of revenue for the quarter divided by our inventory as of the end of such quarter  decreased to in the fourth quarter of compared to turns in third quarter of and increased from turns in the fourth quarter of if the amount of inventory we are holding increases or our inventory turns decrease  the risk of a potential inventory write down and adverse impact on our gross margins increases 
our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in the design and development of our products  prototyping and other development expense  and the depreciation costs related to equipment being used for research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses can fluctuate as a result of long design cycles with periods of relatively low expenses punctuated with increased expenditures for prototypes and product development toward the end of the design cycle 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in sales and marketing  applications engineering  general management  finance  human resources and information technology  as well as expenses related to professional services  insurance and business travel 
litigation expenses consist primarily of attorneys fees and costs and expenses associated with our litigation matters described in item legal proceedings  and such legal proceedings may continue for the upcoming year and beyond 
in  our litigation expenses were approximately million 
our income tax provision is dependent on our estimated annual effective tax rate 
our annual effective tax rate has fluctuated and is dependent on the mix of income and losses between domestic and international operations 
additionally  our annual effective tax rate may also be impacted by any future utilization of available net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income  the utilization of tax credit carry forwards to offset income tax in the us and changing statutory income tax rates 
our domestic deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance because  based on the available objective evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  we may revise this assessment  which could result in a favorable adjustment to the reported income tax provision in the period of re assessment followed by higher reported tax rates in subsequent periods 
our foreign income is typically subject to lower statutory rates than our domestic income 
we expect that both our geographical mix of taxable income and losses as well as the statutory rates we are subject to internationally may change over time  resulting in changes to our effective tax rate and reported income tax provision 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met 
they are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  collectability is reasonably assured  and the fee is fixed or determinable 
determination of criterion is based on a purchase order received from the customer 
determinations of criteria and are based on shipment when title transfers to the customer and management s judgment regarding the collectability of the amounts billed 
determination of criterion is based on the fixed price charged for products delivered adjusted for any applicable discounts 
should management determine that these criteria are not met for certain transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment when title passes and a provision is made for estimated returns and allowances 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for limited return rights in the event of a product failure 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
we track historical rates of return by identifying the period in which the returned products were originally shipped 
we then compute a historical sales return rate for prior quarterly periods 
to determine the estimated return rate for any period  this historical sales return rate may be adjusted for unusual past returns experience related to specific quality issues or other unusual circumstances that are not expected to recur  and consideration of any current information about known product failure rates or business developments 
based on this historical data as well as current business expectations  we estimate sales returns 
while we believe our methodology enables us to make reasonable estimates of sales returns  because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited historical experience  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
a significant difference between actual amounts and our estimates could significantly impact our reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis or market 
we record provisions for inventories for excess or obsolete work in process and finished goods 
newly developed products are generally not valued until they have been qualified for manufacturing and success in the marketplace has been demonstrated through sales and backlog  among other factors 
until products have been qualified for manufacturing and success in the marketplace has been demonstrated  costs associated with these products are generally considered period costs and expensed to research and development 
in addition to provisions based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are made for the remaining inventory based on assumptions about future demand 
we identify excess and obsolete inventory by analyzing inventory aging  recent sales  order backlog  and demand forecasts 
based on these and other factors  we estimate on an individual product basis the net realizable value of our inventory 
net realizable value is determined as the forecast sales of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
we reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value if it is less than standard cost 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than our projections  additional inventory provisions may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the assets and liability method 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ 
table of contents in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains  and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a reporting period and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively 
the difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the consolidated balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered 
this gives rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets for all periods since inception 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income or losses  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed  which would likely result in the recording of an income tax benefit in the period of reduction and increase our effective tax rate in subsequent periods 
see note  income taxes to notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award 
for grants made prior to january   the compensation cost is recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of each grant 
for grants made on or after january   the compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in the absence of an actively traded market for similar financial instruments to those being granted  estimating the fair value of stock based compensation is inherently difficult because the value of the financial instruments cannot be objectively verified 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options under our stock option plans and rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan espp 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including expected term  and volatility 
we estimate these key assumptions using historical information and judgment regarding company specific and market factors and trends 
when estimating expected volatility  we consider the historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility on traded options on our stock 
prior to  due to the limited history of trading and lack of liquidity in both the market for our stock and options on our stock  we also considered the implied volatility on a group of peer companies to develop our estimates as well as other factors 
option grants typically vest over four years to provide long term compensation and a retention incentive to employees 
to estimate the expected term of options granted  we consider the contractual life and vesting period of the option  historical exercise behavior of our employees  and other factors 
after determination of the fair value of the awards  the amount of expense that we recognize is affected by the estimated award forfeiture rate 
if the estimates for these key inputs are changed over time  the amounts recorded for future stock based compensation arrangements may increase  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
to determine the compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards under our equity incentive plan  such expense is determined using the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant  and the compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of such awards or upon the achievement of specified performance goals 
in some instances  performance based stock options may be granted and recognition of any related compensation expense may be dependent upon the achievement of specified performance goals

net revenue was million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase in net revenue was primarily due to increases of million in the consumer and portable market  partially offset by decreases of million and million in sales to the server and storage market and networking and communications market  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue was million in and million in  an increase of 
gross margin was million in and million in  a decrease of 
gross margin as a percent of net revenue was in and in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards the consumer and portable market  which products currently have somewhat lower gross margin percentage than products in our other markets 
we partially mitigated the decrease in gross margin percentage with cost reductions 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in wages and other related expenses of million  which was partially offset by lower performance based bonus expense of million 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily due to increases in stock based compensation of million and intellectual property legal expenses of million  which was partially offset by lower performance based bonus expense of million 
litigation 
litigation expenses were approximately million in and million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in was primarily due to the decrease in activity related to our litigation brought in the united states district court in the northern district of california against the defendants  as described in item legal proceedings

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue was million in and million in  an increase of 
revenues increased approximately million  million and million in the server and storage  consumer and portable  and networking and communications markets respectively  but these increases were offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately million in the desktop and workstation market 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue was million in and million in  an increase of 
gross margin was million in and million in  an increase of 
gross margin as a percent of net revenue was in and in the increase in gross margin percentage was largely due to ongoing cost reduction activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in and million in  an increase of

provision for income tax 
our annual income tax provision was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal years and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in income before taxes from international operations which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million in our short term investments decreased by million in we currently have no debt and believe that our current cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and meet our capital needs for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our operating activities provided net cash of million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
cash provided from operating activities in was primarily due to net income of million  adjustments for non cash items of million and an increase in accounts payable of million due to the timing of goods and services received from suppliers 
the primary non cash items during were stock based compensation expenses of million and depreciation and amortization expenses of million 
the above increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million and decreases in accrued liabilities and long term liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to the timing of customer payments 
the decrease in accrued liabilities and long term liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in profit dependent accruals 
cash provided from operating activities in was primarily due to net income of million and increases in accrued liabilities and long term liabilities of million primarily due to wage accruals  other employment benefit related expense accruals  and profit dependent accruals 
the above increases in cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivables and inventories of million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased revenues and the increase in inventories was primarily due to increased production levels 
the primary sources of cash from operations in was primarily due to net income of million and decreases in inventories of million due to improvements in our inventory management practices and improving business conditions in the second half of there was additional cash generated from increases in accrued liabilities and long term liabilities of million related to higher wage accruals  other employment benefit related expense accruals and profit dependent accruals 
the above increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million and decrease in accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased shipments to our customers in the final quarter of and the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our investing activities provided net cash of million in  compared to net cash used of million in and net cash provided of million in the primary source of cash for investing in was the maturity of short term investment of million  partially offset by purchases of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
the primary use of cash from investing in was the purchase of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million  partially offset by the maturity of short term investments of million 
the primary source of cash from investing in was the maturity of short term investments of million partially offset by the purchase of short term investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
our financing activities provided net cash of million in and million in and net cash used of million in the primary source of cash from financing in was from the sales of securities under the stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of million 
the primary source of cash from financing in was from the sales of securities under the stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock of million 
the primary use of cash from financing in was the repurchase of our common stock of million  partially offset by sales of securities under the stock option and employee stock purchase plans of million 
as of december   the cash and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately million 
if these funds were repatriated to the us  under current tax law we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes on a portion of these funds 
our current plan is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the us contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands and the periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled 
fiscal year purchase obligations operating lease obligations total operating lease obligations consist of the estimated obligations under our real property or facility leases 
purchase obligations are comprised of the estimated obligation for non cancellable in process silicon wafers 
we depend entirely upon third party foundries to manufacture our silicon wafers 
due to lengthy foundry lead times  we typically order these materials up to three months or more in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for the materials in accordance with the contractual payment terms  which typically require payment within one month 

table of contents the amounts in the table above exclude million of income tax liabilities as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement 
see note  income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements we have determined that there were no recent accounting pronouncements issued during the year ended december  that are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we typically maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government treasury and agency securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
as of december  and  our cash equivalents were held in checking and money market accounts 
as of december   all of our short term investments were us treasury securities 
if market interest rates were to increase or decline by from interest rates as of december  and  the impact on our portfolio on these dates would not have been material 
we do not currently use derivative instruments in our investment portfolio 
our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly  our reported sales are not impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
as of december  and  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our results of operations
