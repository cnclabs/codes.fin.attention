represents primarily insurance related liabilities and liabilities for deferred income taxes  incentive compensation and earn out arrangements  classified as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate these payments 
we provide funding to our post retirement plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in our judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated  and therefore  have not been included in the table 
until november   we had a revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility as amended  which provided for a credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility was effective february  and replaced an earlier revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility of million 
effective november   we replaced the revolving credit facility that was due to expire february  with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires in november and permits us to increase our borrowing to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit  which amount compares to million under the revolving credit facility and million under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and 
table of contents indirect subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of most of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants providing for  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain limitations on payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility  which ranges from to  based on certain financial tests 
the fee is of the unused amount as of december  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate which is the prime commercial lending rate announced by bank of montreal from time to time at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests or united states dollar libor at december  plus to  based on certain financial tests 
the interest rate in effect at december  was 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on certain financial tests 
we capitalized approximately million of debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility 
this amount is being amortized over the life of the facility and is included as part of interest expense 
in connection with the termination of the revolving credit facility  million attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs in connection with the revolving credit facility was recorded as part of interest expense 
as of december  and december   we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
we had borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   and we have borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   which may remain outstanding at our discretion until the revolving credit facility expires 
based on the million borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility  if overall interest rates were to increase by basis points  interest expense  net of income taxes  would increase by approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if overall interest rates were to decrease by basis points  interest expense  net of income taxes  would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
on september   we entered into an agreement providing for a million term loan term loan 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to pay a portion of the consideration for an acquisition and costs and expenses incident thereto 
in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility  we borrowed million under that facility and used the proceeds along with cash on hand to prepay on february  all indebtedness outstanding under the term loan  which then terminated 
in connection with this prepayment  million attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs associated with the term loan was recorded as part of interest expense 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap  which hedged our interest rate risk associated with the term loan 
we de designated million of the interest rate swap on december  as it was determined that it was no longer probable that the future estimated cash flows were going to occur as originally estimated 
accordingly  we discontinued the application of hedge accounting associated for this portion of the interest rate swap  and million and million was expensed as part of interest expense  and removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the interest rate swap matured in october one of our subsidiaries had a interest in a venture that designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  had a interest in the venture 
in  the venture  using its own cash and cash from additional capital contributions  acquired its outstanding bonds in the principal amount of million 
as a result of this  we were required to make an additional capital contribution of million to the venture 
in january  this venture  including our investment  was sold to a third party 
as a result of this sale  we received an aggregate amount of million for our interest and recognized a pretax gain of million  which gain is included in our united states facilities services segment and classified as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
on september   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
as of december   there remained authorization for us to repurchase approximately million of our shares 
the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended  recommenced or discontinued at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
acquisitions under our repurchase program may be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
the repurchase program has been and will be funded from the company s internal funds 
the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the 
table of contents surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  assuming defaults on all our then existing contractual obligations  was approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years  there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to the economy and the regulatory environment 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we continually monitor our available limits of surety bonds and discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amount of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond issued on our behalf 
however  if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement for surety bonds  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment  and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decide not to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we guarantee obligations of our subsidiaries under certain contracts 
generally  we are liable under such an arrangement only if our subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract 
historically  we have not incurred any substantial liabilities as a consequence of these guarantees 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain our revolving credit facility  that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
however  negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as a part of our facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during past economic downturns  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid larger long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires greater amounts of working capital 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities and our revolving credit facility 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long term debt to fund acquisitions 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition  our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we do not expect the disposition of our canadian subsidiary to have a material impact on our future liquidity 
we believe that current cash balances and our borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available to us through borrowings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be 
table of contents sufficient to provide our short term and foreseeable long term liquidity needs and meet our expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
we do not believe that any such matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
on september   we announced our plans to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 
per common share 
we paid a quarterly dividend of 
per common share on october  and on january  prior to october   no cash dividends had been paid on the company s common stock 
our revolving credit facility limits the payment of dividends on our common stock 
however  we do not believe that the terms of the credit facility currently materially limit our ability to pay a quarterly dividend of 
per share for the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends has been and will be funded from our operations 
certain insurance matters as of december  and  we utilized approximately million and million  respectively  of letters of credit obtained under our revolving credit facility and our revolving credit facility  respectively  as collateral for insurance obligations 
new accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact  if any  that the adoption of such standards will have 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  there were no new accounting standards that were projected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity
