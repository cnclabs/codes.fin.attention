we continue to explore and discuss opportunities to expand the scope of our alternative investment and private equity activities in europe  the us and elsewhere

also  consistent with our obligations to lfcm holdings llc lfcm holdings  we may explore discrete capital markets opportunities 
business environment economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
as described above  our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our financial advisory and asset management business segments 
as our financial advisory revenues are for the most part dependent on the successful completion of merger  acquisition  restructuring  capital raising or similar transactions  and our asset management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management aum  weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for m a and capital raising activity as well as our asset management business  but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business 
overall  equity market indices at december  reflected little change in the us  and declined outside the us  when compared to such indices at december   with periods of significant volatility during the year 
for the same period  capital raising and m a activity were uneven due to economic uncertainty caused by concerns over the scope and depth of the sovereign debt situation in europe  the us debt ceiling and related rating agency downgrade issues and continuing high us unemployment  among other factors 
the announced value of m a activity increased modestly when compared to restructuring activity continued at low levels  reflecting a cyclical decline in restructuring activity and a decrease in the number of corporate defaults 
entering  the outlook for equity and credit markets appears healthier  interest rates remain low while corporate cash balances remain high  ceo confidence appears to be improving and  as such  companies may be better positioned to make acquisitions for future growth and investors may be increasingly interested in deploying capital for investment purposes 
uncertainty remains  however  with regard to the stability of the global financial system and a variety of other factors 
in recent years  we have expanded our geographic reach  bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas 
companies  government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective  deep understanding of capital structure  informed research and knowledge of global economic conditions 
we believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel 
we seek to leverage the power and scale of our firm wide global network to drive growth in both our financial advisory and asset management business segments 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from opportunities that may result from regional or global increases in m a  restructuring  capital raising or similar transactions  as well as increases in demand for investment management and advisory services 
we continue to focus on the development of our business in this environment and on a wide variety of related factors  including the generation of stable revenue growth during periods of macroeconomic volatility  the prudent management of our costs and expenses and the return of cash to our shareholders 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see the section entitled risk factors in this form k 
furthermore  net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter

year ended december  incr decr in billions completed m a transactions global value number trans atlantic value number announced m a transactions global value number trans atlantic value number source dealogic as of january  we continue to believe that we are relatively well positioned as our clients refinance  restructure and reposition their asset portfolios for growth 
global restructuring activity during decreased from levels driven by a cyclical decline  resulting in a decelerating pace of corporate debt defaults 
according to moody s investors service  inc  during a total of issuers defaulted  as compared to in while the number and value of corporate defaults for are significantly lower as compared to  we expect that our restructuring business will remain active 
our restructuring activities include advising companies on matters relating to debt restructurings  refinancings and other on and off balance sheet assignments 
our restructuring assignments are generally executed over a six to eighteen month period 
our private fund advisory group  which is part of our financial advisory segment and is conducted in the us through lazard fr res co 
llc lfny  an sec registered broker dealer and municipal advisor and member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra and the municipal securities rulemaking board the msrb  acts as placement agent for investment funds  including investment funds that have historically received capital from certain public pension funds 
in april  governmental officials in new york announced a new policy banning the use of placement agents by funds seeking investment contributions from the new york state and new york city public pension funds 
the use of placement agents has also been prohibited or otherwise restricted with respect to investments by public pension funds in illinois  ohio  california and new mexico  and similar measures are being considered or have been implemented in other jurisdictions 
on june   the sec approved an amendment to its june  rule which  among other things  will place certain restrictions on the use of placement agents 
as amended  the sec rule will prohibit investment advisors from paying a third party placement agent for soliciting investment advisory business from a us governmental entity  unless the placement agent is i an sec registered investment advisor complying with the rule  ii an sec registered broker dealer that is a member of finra and thus subject to finra s forthcoming pay to play rule  or iii a municipal advisor that is registered with the sec under section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and subject to the pay to play rules that will be adopted by the msrb 
we are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of state  local and other restrictions on our private fund advisory business

vs 
msci world index cac dax ftse topix msci emerging market dow jones industrial average nasdaq s p the fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of aum 
accordingly  since market movements and foreign currency volatility impact the level of our aum  such items will impact the level of revenues we receive from our asset management business 
a substantial portion of our aum is invested in equities  and market movements reflected in the changes in lazard s aum during the period generally corresponded to the changes in global market indices 
our aum at december  decreased versus aum at december  primarily due to market and foreign exchange depreciation  while our average aum for increased as compared to our average aum in the higher levels of average aum contributed to increased management fee revenues in financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue is earned from the successful completion of m a transactions  strategic advisory matters  restructuring and capital structure advisory services  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main drivers of financial advisory net revenue are overall m a activity  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction  and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings and for referring opportunities to lfcm holdings for underwriting  distribution and placement of securities 
the referral fees received from lfcm holdings are generally one half of the revenue recorded by lfcm holdings in respect of such activities 
significant fluctuations in financial advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year  because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
lazard s asset management segment principally includes lazard asset management llc together with its subsidiaries  lam  lfg  edgewater commencing july  and lazard wealth management 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to institutional and private clients 
as noted above  the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level of aum  which is influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets and lazard s investment performance  which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets 

table of contents as a result  fluctuations including timing thereof in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
asset management fees are generally based on the level of aum measured daily  monthly or quarterly  and an increase or reduction in aum  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  net client asset flows or otherwise  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
the majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of days or less 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
in addition  as lazard s aum includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity investments  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds 
for hedge funds  incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds 
the company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period unless an account terminates during the year  and therefore such incentive fees are usually recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
for private equity funds  incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold 
typically  such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole fund basis and  therefore  clawback of carried interests during the life of the fund can occur 
as a result  incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined  including any potential for clawback 
corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the company s seed investments in lam equity and fixed income funds and principal investments in equities and alternative asset management funds  investments at lfb and equity method investments including gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  interest income and interest expense 
corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as trading  and with respect to available for sale investments  when realized  or  with respect to available for sale and held to maturity investments  when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash  investments and indebtedness 
during the fourth quarter of  all of lfb s remaining corporate debt portfolio that had been previously designated as available for sale was sold  with net realized losses on a pre tax basis reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax aoci to investment gains losses 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded net investment gains of million and million  respectively  in aoci 
as of december  and subsequent thereto  the company held no available for sale or held to maturity investments 
although corporate segment net revenue during represented of lazard s net revenue  total assets in the corporate segment represented of lazard s consolidated total assets as of december   which is attributable to investments in government bonds and money market funds  fixed income funds  alternative asset management funds and other securities  private equity investments  cash and assets associated with lfb 

table of contents operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees 
our compensation and benefits expense includes i salaries and benefits  ii amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards  including a share based incentive compensation under the lazard ltd equity incentive plan the plan and the lazard ltd incentive compensation plan the plan and b lazard fund interests see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and iii a provision for discretionary or guaranteed bonuses and profit pools 
compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors  including general economic and market conditions  our operating and financial performance  staffing levels  competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned  as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation 
we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue  both non us gaap measures  provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present  historical and future years 
awarded compensation and benefits expense for a given year is calculated using adjusted compensation and benefits expense  as modified by the following items we deduct amortization expense recorded for us gaap purposes in each fiscal year associated with the vesting of deferred incentive compensation awards  we add i the grant date fair value of the deferred incentive compensation awards granted applicable to the relevant year end compensation process eg grant date fair value of deferred incentive awards granted in  and related to the  and year end compensation processes  respectively and ii investments in people eg sign on bonuses and other special deferred incentive awards granted throughout the applicable year  with such amounts in i and ii reduced by an estimate of future forfeitures of such awards  and we adjust for year end foreign exchange fluctuations 
for interim periods we use adjusted compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue  both non us gaap measures  for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods 
for the calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense and awarded compensation and benefits expense and related ratios to operating revenue  see the table under consolidated results of operations below 
lazard s operating expenses also include non compensation expense which includes costs for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses  the provision benefit pursuant to the tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings  amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and  in and  restructuring expense 
amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to the acquisition of edgewater 
restructuring expense relates to certain staff reductions and realignment of personnel in the first quarters of and  and includes severance and related benefits expense  the acceleration of unrecognized expense pertaining to restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of lazard ltd class a common stock rsus previously granted to individuals who were terminated and certain other costs related to these initiatives 
provision for income taxes as a result of its indirect investment in lazard group  lazard ltd  through certain of its subsidiaries  is subject to us federal income taxes on its portion of lazard group s operating income 
lazard group primarily operates in the us as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  lazard group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to us federal income taxes because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of the individual partners 
outside the us  lazard group operates principally through corporations and is subject to local income taxes 

table of contents income taxes shown on lazard s consolidated statements of operations are principally related to non us entities and to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt attributable to lazard s operations apportioned to new york city 
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests primarily relate to the amount attributable to laz md holdings ownership interest in the net income of lazard group  amounts related to edgewater  and various lam related general partnership interests gps in limited partnerships held directly by certain of our lam managing directors and investment companies which are deemed to be controlled by the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s noncontrolling interests 
consolidated results of operations lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of our non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members stockholders equity 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
during and  the company reported certain credits charges the special items and the special items  respectively  and collectively  the and special items that significantly impacted operating results for the applicable years 
we believe that the impact of the and special items should be considered when comparing the results of the years in providing the most meaningful comparison between present  historical and future periods 
the impact of such special items on the company s consolidated statements of operations described in more detail in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements is reflected in the table below

table of contents business segments the following is a discussion of net revenue and operating income for the company s business segments financial advisory  asset management and corporate 
each segment s operating expenses include i compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and ii other operating expenses  which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourcing  and indirect support costs including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto for administrative services 
such administrative services include  but are not limited to  accounting  tax  legal  facilities management and senior management activities 
such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as headcount  square footage and other factors

table of contents net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and strategic advisory and restructuring are generally correlated to the volume of completed industry wide m a transactions and restructurings occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  our results can diverge from industry wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry wide m a activity in a particular market where lazard has significant market share  or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions  and where we are involved in significant non public assignments 
certain lazard client statistics and global industry statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients with fees greater than million total financial advisory m a and strategic advisory percentage of total financial advisory revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed with values greater than billion b a there were no individual clients that constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source dealogic as of january  the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the lazard offices that generate financial advisory net revenue  which are located in the us  europe primarily in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world primarily in australia and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located 
year ended december  united states europe rest of world total the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on m a  strategic advisory matters and restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professionals with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings 
while lazard measures revenue by practice area  lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of m a services as compared to restructuring services 
accordingly  lazard measures performance in its financial advisory segment based on overall segment net revenue and operating income margins 
financial advisory results of operations as reflected in the table of operating results of the financial advisory segment above  the portion of the and special items attributable to the financial advisory segment had a significant impact on the segment s reported operating results for the respective years 
lazard management believes that comparisons between years are most meaningful after excluding the impact of such items

the decrease in capital markets and other advisory revenue in was primarily attributable to a lower level of closings by private fund advisory 
restructuring revenue is derived from various activities including bankruptcy assignments  global debt and financing restructurings  distressed asset sales and advice on complex on and off balance sheet assignments 
the decline in restructuring revenue was in turn driven by a cyclical decline in global restructuring activity  resulting in a lower number of active assignments in  as compared to the prior year  and a corresponding decrease in completion fees

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities  financing agreements and equity offerings 
operating activities net revenue  operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between quarters 
in the case of financial advisory  fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
in the case of asset management  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not earned until the end of the applicable measurement period  which is generally the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year  with the respective receivable collected in the first quarter of the following year 

table of contents liquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for  or in respect of  incentive compensation  a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year 
as a consequence  cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year 
we also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors  which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates

at december   lazard had approximately billion of cash  with such amount including approximately million held at lazard s operations outside the us 
since lazard provides for us income taxes on substantially all of its unrepatriated foreign earnings  no material amount of additional us income taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from its foreign operations 
we maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements

such repurchase resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
lazard s annual cash flow generated from operations historically has been sufficient to enable it to meet its annual obligations 
lazard has not drawn on its credit facility and prior revolving credit facility since june  we believe that our cash flows from operating activities  along with the use of our credit lines as needed  should be sufficient for us to fund our current obligations for the next months and beyond 
as long as the lenders commitments remain in effect  any loan pursuant to the credit facility remains outstanding and unpaid or any other amount is owing to the lending bank group  the credit facility includes financial condition covenants that require that lazard group not permit i its consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for the month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than to or ii its consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit facility for the month period ending on the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than to

in any event  no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of december  in addition  the credit facility  indenture and supplemental indentures relating to lazard group s senior notes contain certain other covenants none of which relate to financial condition  events of default and other customary provisions

effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses  such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see risk factors other business risks difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of the transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds see financial statement overview 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on management s analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired  which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
with respect to fees receivable from financial advisory activities  such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding days from the date of invoice 
however  some financial advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years as is the case for our private fund advisory fees following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings 
in such cases  receivables are deemed past due when payment is not received by the agreed upon contractual date or the court approval date  respectively 
financial advisory fee receivables past due in excess of days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible 
asset management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding months after the invoice date 
notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due  we specifically reserve against exposures relating to financial advisory and asset management fees where we determine receivables are impaired 
at december  and  the company had receivables past due of approximately million and million  respectively  and its allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at such respective dates 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax paying entities in each of their respective jurisdictions 
in addition to estimating actual current tax liability for these jurisdictions  we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains or losses on investments and depreciation and amortization  as well as intercompany transactions such as revenue sharing  dividends and interest expense 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and  as discussed below  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
a deferred tax asset is recognized if it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of greater than that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority 
the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we recorded deferred tax assets of approximately billion 
subsequent to the recognition of deferred tax assets  we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset  we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset 
in order to determine whether we apply a valuation allowance  we must assess whether it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized  taking into account all available information 
the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends  among other things  on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction 
although we have been profitable on a consolidated basis in the last two years  certain of our tax paying entities have individually experienced pre tax losses on a cumulative three year basis primarily due to permanent differences between net income and taxable income at such entities 
considering these losses and the other factors listed below  we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately billion on our deferred tax assets as of december  we consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior years  and tax planning strategies 
the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information  including the following nature  frequency and severity of any recent losses  duration of statutory carryforward periods  historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused  and near term and medium term financial outlook 
the weight we give to any particular item is  in part  dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified 
we give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity 
pre tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered significant evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income 

table of contents the table below sets forth our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  as of december  and december  december  in thousands deferred tax assets basis adjustments primarily as a result of the separation and recapitalization transactions that occurred during and from secondary offerings compensation and benefits net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depreciation and amortization other gross deferred tax assets valuation allowance total deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance deferred tax liabilities depreciation and amortization compensation and benefits goodwill other total deferred tax liabilities as mentioned previously  certain of our tax paying entities have individually experienced losses on cumulative basis over the past several years 
if these entities achieve sustainable levels of profitability in the future  we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets at such entities could be reduced significantly 
if any valuation allowance reduction were to occur  we would likely have a negative effective tax rate in the period in which such reduction occurs 
included in our deferred tax assets as of december  are approximately million related to certain basis step ups and approximately million of net operating losses generated by the amortization of such step up assets 
under our tax receivable agreement  lazard group will retain of the actual cash tax savings relating to such assets and will pay of such savings to the former owners of lazard 
as a result  in the event of a reduction of our valuation allowance  we also would recognize a liability relating to the portion expected to be payable under the tax receivable agreement 
the creation of this liability could potentially offset a significant amount but not all of the income we would otherwise recognize upon a release of the valuation allowance 
if any valuation allowance reduction were to occur  for subsequent periods  our effective tax rate  with all other factors being held constant  would increase and could be significantly higher than our effective tax rate in the period immediately preceding the reduction in the valuation allowance 
in such a situation  an increase in our effective tax rate would not impact the amount of cash income taxes we would pay in those periods subsequent to the release of any valuation allowance 
in addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances  other factors affect our provision for income taxes  including changes in the geographic mix of our business  the level of our annual pre tax income  transfer pricing and intercompany transactions 
in addition  our interpretation of complex tax laws may impact our recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
tax contingencies involve complex issues and often require an extended period of time to resolve 
tax contingencies that are resolved in a manner that is adverse to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

consolidation of vies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and all other entities in which it has a controlling interest 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
lazard is required to consolidate a voting interest entity that it maintains an ownership interest in if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such entity 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
if lazard has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests in a vie  it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such vie 
lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard is determined to be the primary beneficiary are consolidated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
those vies include company sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with lazard s compensation plans 
risk management we encounter risk in the normal course of business  and therefore  in order to help manage and monitor such risks  we have designed risk management processes which consider both the nature of our business and our operating model 
we are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk  including risks related to the level of soundness of our clients  financial  governmental and other institutions and third parties  as well as operational and liquidity risks see liquidity and capital resources and we monitor these risks at both an entity level and on a consolidated basis 
management within each of lazard s operating locations is principally responsible for managing the risks within its respective businesses on a day to day basis 
market and or credit risks related to our investing activities are discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates investments above 
risks related to lazard s other activities are presented below 
lazard has established procedures to assess credit and market risks  as well as specific interest rate and currency risk  and has established limits related to various positions 
risks related to receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net 
table of contents of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
as of that date  financial advisory and asset management fees  customer and related party receivables comprised  and of total receivables  respectively 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
as of that date  financial advisory and asset management fees  customer and related party receivables comprised  and of total receivables  respectively 
see also critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding receivables 
lfb engages in lending activities  including commitments to extend credit 
at december  and  customer and related party receivables included million and million of lfb loans  respectively 
such loans are closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness to help minimize exposure 
in addition  as of december   lfb had commitments to lend totaling million  which are fully collateralized and generally contain requirements for the counterparty to maintain a minimum collateral level 
lfb fully secures its collateralized lending and borrowing transactions with fixed income securities 
credit concentrations to reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit from banking activities within lfb  the company has established limits for corporate counterparties and monitors the exposure against such limits 
at december   excluding inter bank counterparties  lfb had no exposure to an individual counterparty that exceeded million  with such amount being fully collateralized 
with respect to activities outside lfb  as of december  the company s largest individual counterparty exposure was a financial advisory fee receivable of million  the terms of which require payment over a remaining period of months  including accrued interest 
risks related to derivatives lazard enters into interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposures to interest rates and currency exchange rates and uses equity and fixed income swap contracts to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain equity investments 
at december  and  such derivative contracts are recorded at fair value 
derivative assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and derivative liabilities  excluding the derivative liability arising from the company s obligation pertaining to lazard fund interests and other similar deferred compensation arrangements  amounted to million and million at such respective dates 
in addition  lfb may take open foreign exchange positions with a view to profit  but does not sell foreign exchange options in this context  and enters into interest rate swaps  forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative contracts to hedge exposures to interest rate and currency fluctuations 
the primary market risks associated with lfb s foreign currency exchange hedging and lending activities are sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
the risk management strategies that we employ use various risk sensitivity metrics to measure such risks and to examine behavior under significant adverse market conditions 
the following sensitivity metrics provide the resultant effects on the company s operating income for the year ended december  lfb s interest rate risk as measured by a basis point change in interest rates totaled thousand 
foreign currency risk associated with lfb s open positions  in the aggregate  as measured by a basis point change against the us dollar  totaled approximately thousand 

table of contents risks related to short term investments and corporate indebtedness a significant portion of the company s indebtedness has fixed interest rates  while its cash and short term investments generally have floating interest rates 
based on account balances as of december   lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and short term investments and corporate indebtedness would increase by approximately million in the event interest rates were to increase by and decrease by approximately million if rates were to decrease by 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately billion 
substantially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid institutional money market funds a significant majority of which were invested solely in us government or agency money market funds or in short term interest earning accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world  or in short term certificates of deposit from such banks 
on a regular basis  management reviews and updates its list of approved depositor banks as well as deposit and investment thresholds 
operational risks operational risk is inherent in all our business and may  for example  manifest itself in the form of errors  breaches in the system of internal controls  business interruptions  fraud or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance 
the company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information 
management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs 
the company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption 
we purchase insurance programs designed to protect the company against accidental loss and losses  which may significantly affect our financial objectives  personnel  property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups
