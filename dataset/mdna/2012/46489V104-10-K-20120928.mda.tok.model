item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates past judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  accrued liabilities  and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments the accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the financial accounting standards board fasb  permits  but does not require  entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items not specifically identified in other topics of the asc  such as available for sale investments  at fair value 
we have not elected to measure additional assets and liabilities at fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
a three level valuation hierarchy is used to qualify fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative financial instruments actively traded on exchanges  as well as us treasury securities and us government and agency mortgage backed securities that are actively traded in highly liquid over the counter markets 
level model inputs are observable inputs  other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs that are observable or can be corroborated  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level assets and liabilities include debt instruments that are traded less frequently than exchange traded securities and derivative instruments  for which the model inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market observable data 
examples in this category are less frequently traded mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities and derivative contracts 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable but significant to the fair value measurement 
examples in this category include interests in loans held for sale  certain securitized financial assets or certain private equity investments 
fair value is applied to eligible assets based on quoted market prices  where available 
for financial instruments for which quotes from recent exchange transactions are not available  fair value is based on discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons to similar instruments 
discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon estimated future cash flows and the level of interest rates 
the methods used for current fair value calculations of level and level assets and liabilities may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
if readily determined market values became available  or if actual performance were to vary appreciably from assumptions used  assumptions may need to be adjusted  which could result in material differences from the recorded carrying amounts 
we believe our methods of determining fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants 
however  the use of different methodologies or application of different assumptions to value certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value 
effective july   the company implemented asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  of the financial accounting standards board fasb  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company elected to implement this standard with the one year deferral permitted for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value  except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis 
this deferral applied to fixed assets and intangible asset impairment testing and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations for which fair value is used 
the company does not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements when we implement asc for these assets and liabilities 
asc requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroborated inputs 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market participants 
at june   all of the company s financial assets and liabilities are accounted and reported at fair value using level inputs 
also effective july   the company adopted asc topic  financial instruments 
the statement allows entities to value many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
asc provides guidance over the election of the fair value option  including the timing of the election and specific items eligible for the fair value accounting 
if the fair value option is elected then unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the company elected not to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value as of july  in accordance with asc accordingly  the adoption of asc did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
the company did elect to fair value its ars rights that were received in october and exercised in january in accordance with asc accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amount that management of the company expects to collect from outstanding balances 
management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on management s judgment  considering historical write offs  collections and current credit conditions 
balances which remain outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a credit to the applicable accounts receivable 
payments received subsequent to the time that an account is written off are considered bad debt recoveries 
inventory inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market 
cost of raw materials is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in process and finished goods is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
fixed assets fixed assets are capitalized and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives production equipment to years office equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset 
management of the company periodically reviews the net carrying value of all of its equipment on an asset by asset basis 
these reviews consider the net realizable value of each asset to determine whether an impairment of value has occurred  and if there is a need for any asset impairment write down 
although management has made its best estimate of the factors that affect the carrying value based on current conditions  it is reasonably possible that changes could occur which could adversely affect management s estimate of net cash flows expected to be generated from its assets  and necessitate asset impairment write downs 
deferred financing costs financing costs related to the acquisition of debt are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method 
deferred financing costs include the fair value of common shares issued to certain shareholders for their guarantee of certain company debt in accordance with asc capitalization of interest and asc statement of cash flows 
the value of the shares issued was the estimated market price of the shares as of the date of issuance 
amortization of deferred financing costs  totaling none and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  is included in financing expense on the statements of operations 
deferred financing costs related the creation of warrant liabilities as the result of the issuance of shares of common stock are deferred and amortized over the term of the related warrant on a straight line basis 
deferred financing cost related to the creation of the warrant liability was recorded on a proportionate basis with the aggregate amount of the total offering 
amortization of deferred financing costs  totaling  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  is included in financing and interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred financing costs were fully amortized at the year ended june  and june  licenses amortization of licenses is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
amortization of licenses was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
based on the licenses recorded at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for  for all years thereafter 
other assets other assets  which include deferred charges and patents  are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization of patents is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful lives of the assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of patents and other assets 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows to be derived from such assets are less than their carrying value 
amortization of other assets was  and  for the years ended june  and respectively 
based on the patents and other intangible assets recorded in other assets at june   and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets  the annual amortization expense for each fiscal year ending june is expected to be as follows  for each year through   for and  thereafter 
asset retirement obligation the fair value of the future retirement costs of the company s leased assets are recorded as a liability on a discounted basis when they are incurred and an equivalent amount is capitalized to property and equipment 
the initial recorded obligation is discounted using the company s credit adjusted risk free rate and is reviewed periodically for changes in the estimated future costs underlying the obligation 
the company amortizes the initial amount capitalized to property and equipment and recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the estimated remaining useful life of the leased assets 
in september  an asset retirement obligation of  was established representing the discounted cost of the company s estimate of the obligations to remove any residual radioactive materials and all leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term at its new production facility 
the estimate was developed by qualified production personnel and the general contractor of the new facility 
the company has reviewed the estimate again based on its experience with decommissioning its old facility and believes that the original estimate continues to be applicable 
during the years ended june  and  the asset retirement obligations changed as follows beginning balance   accretion of discount   ending balance   because the company does not expect to incur any expenses related to its asset retirement obligations in fiscal year  the entire balance as of june  is classified as a noncurrent liability 
financial instruments the company discloses the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  recognized and not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate the fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than a forced liquidation sale 
the carrying amounts of financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and notes payable  approximated their fair values at june  and revenue recognition the company applies the provisions of asc topic  revenue recognition 
asc provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for the disclosure of revenue recognition policies 
the company recognizes revenue related to product sales when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and was derived primarily from sales of the proxcelan cs brachytherapy seed  which is used in the treatment of cancer 
the company began shipping its gliasite radiation therapy system in the fiscal year ended june  which is used in the treatment of brain cancer 
the company recognizes revenue once the product has been shipped to the customer 
prepayments  if any  received from customers prior to the time that products are shipped are recorded as deferred revenue 
in these cases  when the related products are shipped  the amount recorded as deferred revenue is then recognized as revenue 
the company accrues for sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
although the company does not have an extensive operating history upon which to develop sales returns estimates  we have used the expertise of our management team  particularly those with extensive industry experience and knowledge  to develop a proper methodology 
product returns and allowances the company as part of normal operations allows for customers to receive credit for patient procedures cancelled after shipping to the customer for a variety of criteria 
these criteria include but are not limited to a physical symptom on the date of procedure that interferes with the patient s ability to go forward with the procedure  discovery that a patient s condition is beyond treatment during surgery and other criteria as determined acceptable by management 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes expense for all share based payments at fair value 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate fair value for all stock options on the date of grant 
for stock options that vest over time  the company recognizes compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
research and development costs research and development costs  including salaries  research materials  administrative expenses and contractor fees  are charged to operations as incurred 
the cost of equipment used in research and development activities which has alternative uses is capitalized as part of fixed assets and not treated as an expense in the period acquired 
depreciation of capitalized equipment used to perform research and development is classified as research and development expense in the year recognized 
research and development reimbursement research and development reimbursement recorded during the year ended june  is a reimbursement from the german distributor of the gliasite radiation therapy system in support of the product development 
research and development reimbursement recorded during the year ended june  is the amount of cost recoverable as part of the grants related to the qualified therapeutic discovery project received by the company in october the grants allowed for qualified investments to be recovered at of the amounts expended up to the specified limits by tax year 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  environmental matters  and a variety of other matters 
the company is also subject to various local  state  and federal environmental regulations and laws due to the isotopes used to produce the company s product 
as part of normal operations  amounts are expended to ensure that the company is in compliance with these laws and regulations 
while there have been no reportable incidents or compliance issues  the company believes that if it relocates its current production facilities then certain decommissioning expenses will be incurred and has recorded an asset retirement obligation for these expenses 
the company records contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  the company does not believe any probable legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
under this method  the company provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years based on the reporting of certain costs in different periods for financial statement and income tax purposes 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment of the change 
management has determined that the company  its subsidiary  and its predecessors are subject to examination of their income tax filings in the united states and state jurisdictions for the through tax years 
in the event that the company is assessed penalties and or interest  penalties will be charged to other operating expense and interest will be charged to interest expense 
income loss per common share basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  and does not include the impact of any potentially dilutive common stock equivalents  including preferred stock  common stock warrants or options that are potentially convertible into common stock as those would be anti dilutive due to the company s net loss position 
securities that could be dilutive in the future as of june  and are as follows preferred stock   common stock warrants   common stock options   total potential dilutive securities   subsequent events effective april   the company adopted asc subsequent events 
this statement establishes the accounting for  and disclosure of  material events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before the financial statements are issued 
in general  these events will be recognized if the condition existed at the date of the balance sheet  and will not be recognized if the condition did not exist at the balance sheet date 
disclosure is required for non recognized events if required to keep the financial statements from being misleading 
the guidance in this statement is very similar to current guidance provided in accounting literature and  therefore  will not result in significant changes in practice 
subsequent events have been evaluated through the date our financial statements were issued the filing time and date of our annual report on form k 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates and affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
results of operations financial presentation the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations for the two years ended june  and this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors  beginning on page of this annual report on form k

these non prostate treatments using brachytherapy seeds include lung  colorectal  head and neck  chest wall  vaginal cuff and brain which increased from of total revenue during the year ended june  to of total revenue during the year ended june  the company began selling its gliasite radiation therapy system in the year ended june  which contributed approximately  of new revenue 
this new revenue represents approximately of the total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  the company continued to experience a reduction in revenue contributed by prostate treatments using brachytherapy seeds of approximately  or 
the company experienced a decrease of in the total number of seed brachytherapy cases for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  seed brachytherapy cases treating non prostate cancers increased by in the year ended june  compared to june  while seed brachytherapy cases treating prostate cancer decreased by in the year ended june  compared to june  there were eight cases treated with the gliasite rts product line in the year ended june  and none in the prior year as the product was introduced in the year ended june  management believes that the overall market for prostate brachytherapy has received increased pressure from other treatment options with higher reimbursement rates such as intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt as revenue generated from treating this modality decreased from of total revenue in the fiscal year ended june  to of total revenue in the fiscal year ended june  management has continued its focus on the new treatment modalities as they are expected to become a larger portion of the total revenue in the future 
revenues from treating these new modalities grew from of total revenue in the year ended june  to of revenue in the year ended june  cost of product sales 
the total cost of product sales for both seed production and gliasite rts production was  for the year ended june  cost of product sales related to seed production was  for the year ended june  compared to cost of product sales related to seed production of  for the year ended june  in the year ended june   the company incurred  of cost of product sales related to the production of the gliasite radiation therapy system 
this was the initial fiscal year of producing and selling the gliasite radiation therapy system 
the company experienced an increase in the cost of product sales of  or for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  the fiscal year over fiscal year cost increase of  was impacted primarily by the reduction in research and development projects undertaken by management and the addition of production costs related to the gliasite radiation therapy system in the year ended june  when compared to the year ended june  in the year ended june   these research and development efforts utilized personnel and materials of the company whose related cost were transferred to the research and development operating expense 
these cost reductions did not continue in fiscal as the research and development projects were substantially complete at june these cost increases in the year ended june  included the addition of  in production costs related to the gliasite radiation therapy system and the addition of seed production costs of  the increase in seed production costs of  was created by an increase of approximately  in third party pre loading expense  an increase in payroll and benefits expense of approximately  as the result of decreased use of production staff on research and development efforts  an increase in other production expenses of approximately  as the result of property tax  calibration expense and training expense  and an increase in internal pre loading expense of approximately  that resulted from the increased use of labor  benefits and material as the result of the increased use of the company in house loading service by customers that previously selected the third party loading expense 
gross margin 
gross margin was  for the year ended june  compared to a gross margin of  for the year ended june  the decrease of  or was primarily due to the decreased utilization of production personnel on the research and development projects described above  the addition of production costs related to the gliasite radiation therapy system and the reduction in product sales in the year ended june  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  were  which represents a decrease of  or approximately less than the research and development expenses of  for the year ended june  the cost decrease of approximately  in the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to a decrease in other organ research expense of approximately  and an increase in protocol expense of  as the company undertook some new protocols and the prior year contained non recurring reversals of accrued protocol expense 
research and development reimbursement 
research and development reimbursement for the year ended june  was  as the result of a reimbursement of developmental expenses from the distributor of the gliasite radiation therapy system received from the german based distributor compared to the  received from grants during october as part of the qualified therapeutic discovery project administered by the internal revenue service under the patient protection and affordable care act public law that was recorded in the year ended june  sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  for the year ended june  compared to sales and marketing expenses of  for the year ended june   which represents a decrease of  or

financing and interest expense for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
financing expense included interest expense of approximately and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  a decrease of  the decrease is due to the decreased debt balances in the year ended june  the remaining balance of financing expense represents the amortization of deferred debt financing costs of approximately and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  and the amortization of deferred equity financing costs of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company has historically financed its operations through the sale of common stock and the issuance of related common stock warrants 
during fiscal year  the company used existing cash reserves and cash received through sales of common stock to fund its operations and capital expenditures 
cash flows from operating activities cash used in operating activities was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year  an increase of approximately  or 
cash used by operating activities is net loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase of net cash used by operating activities of  is attributable to the increase in the company s net loss of  with an increase in non cash charges of  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and a reduction of  in operating assets and liabilities in the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year cash flows from investing activities cash used by investing activities was approximately  for the year ended june  and provided by investing activities was approximately  for the year ended june  cash expenditures for fixed assets were approximately  in the year ended june  and approximately  in the year ended june  cash expenditures for licenses and other assets were approximately  in the year ended june  and were approximately  in the year ended june  cash flows from financing activities cash provided in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  and cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  cash provided in financing activities was provided primarily through sales of common stock reduced by the payment of debt and preferred dividends in the year ended june  and the year ended june  cash used in financing activities was used mainly for payments of debt  preferred dividends and the cash payment of stock offering costs during the year ended june  and the year ended june  projected liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and cash equivalents amounted to  compared to  of cash and cash equivalents at june  the company had approximately million of cash on hand as of september  the increase from june  was the result of the sale of common stock in july as of that date  management believed that the company s monthly required cash operating expenditures were approximately  which remains materially unchanged from average monthly cash operating expenditures in fiscal year management believes that less than  will be spent on capital expenditures for the entire fiscal year  but there is no assurance that unanticipated needs for capital equipment may not arise 
during fiscal year  the company intends to continue its existing protocol studies and begin new protocol studies for several of its non prostate applications 
the company has budgeted approximately  in fiscal year for protocol expenses relating to lung cancer as well as continued work on the dual therapy prostate protocols 
these expenditures may include maintenance costs for the online data collection system developed during the fiscal years and based on the foregoing assumptions  management believes cash and cash equivalents on hand at june  should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
management plans to attain breakeven and generate additional cash flows by increasing revenues from the company s existing treatment applications of the cs brachytherapy seed to both new and existing customers through our direct sales channels and through our distributors  while expanding into new market applications for cs and continuing to maintain the company s focus on cost control 
additionally  management plans to increase revenue through expanding the sale of the fda cleared and iso certified gliasite radiation therapy system to current customers  adding new customers through the company s direct sales force  through the existing distribution agreement which covers germany  austria  switzerland  italy and luxembourg and the addition of other distribution channels to european union countries covered by the iso certifications 
this product will be utilized in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme which is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer in humans 
management believes the company will reach breakeven with revenues of approximately  per month with cashflow breakeven from operations being reached at approximately  however  there can be no assurance that the company will attain profitability or that the company will be able to attain its revenue targets 
sales in the prostate market have continued to shrink  which has not allowed breakeven to be reached during the past two fiscal years and these sales continued to decline during the year ended june  as management has focused on expanding into head and neck  colorectal  lung and brain applications and experienced growth in sales for non prostate seed applications in excess of comparing fiscal year to fiscal year  management believes the company may need to continue to raise additional capital after fiscal year is complete to meet nyse mkt listing standards as this entry into new markets may take longer to generate revenues
