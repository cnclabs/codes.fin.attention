item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business redwood invests in  finances  and manages real estate assets 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to generate sufficient long term cash flow returns to support our goal of distributing an attractive level of dividends per share to shareholders over time 
we primarily invest in residential mortgage loans  commercial loans and other forms of commercial real estate financing  and in securities collateralized by real estate loans which are securities issued in securitization transactions and which are also referred to as mortgage backed securities 
our investments in residential mortgage loans are generally made with a view towards securitizing those loans through a sequoia securitization entity or selling those loans to third parties 
our investments in commercial loans are generally held for investment and not secured by real property 
the mortgage backed securities we typically invest in include senior securities  which are those interests in a mortgage securitization that generally have the first right to cash flows and are generally last to absorb losses  and subordinate securities  which are those interests in a mortgage securitization that generally have the last right to cash flows and are generally first in line to absorb losses 
some of the securities we invest in are re remic support securities  which are securities that are generally created through the resecuritization of senior mortgage backed securities 
re remic support securities are subordinate to  and provide credit support for  the senior re remic securities issued in a resecuritization 
we also invest in other assets  securities  and instruments that are related to residential and commercial real estate 
securities collateralized by residential mortgage loans  which we also refer to as residential securities  that we invest in are generally acquired by us from third parties or by retaining mortgage backed securities issued by sequoia securitization trusts  which are securitization entities we sponsor 
the process of sponsoring a sequoia securitization includes the acquisition of residential loans  which are originated by third parties and generally funded with equity and short term debt while being accumulated for securitization  the transfer of a pool of those loans to a sequoia securitization entity  and the structuring and issuance by the sequoia securitization entity of mortgage backed securities collateralized by that pool of loans 
senior securities issued by sequoia securitization entities are generally issued to third parties  while some or all of the subordinate securities issued by these entities are generally retained by us 
from time to time we may also invest in senior interest only io securities issued by a sequoia securitization entity 
these io securities receive interest payments but no principal payments related to securitized residential mortgage loans 
our investments in commercial loans and other forms of commercial real estate financing generally result from our origination of subordinate financing for commercial real estate 
subordinate financing for commercial real estate can take the form of mezzanine loans or subordinate mortgage loans and can also take the form of preferred equity interests in special purpose entities that own commercial real estate 
in addition to directly originating commercial loans and directly providing preferred equity financing  we may invest in commercial loans and financing originated by others including through ownership of commercial mortgage backed securities 
our primary source of income is net interest income from our investments in real estate related assets of the types described above 
this net interest income consists of the interest income we earn from our investments less the interest expenses we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities 
we assume a range of risks in our investments and the level of risk is influenced by the manner in which we finance our purchases of  and derive income from  our investments 
throughout our history we have sponsored other investment entities that include a private limited partnership fund that we managed  the redwood opportunity fund  lp the fund  as well as acacia securitization entities  certain of which we continue to manage 
the fund was invested in real estate securities and the acacia entities are primarily invested in a variety of real estate related assets 
we are not currently seeking to sponsor other entities like the fund or the acacia securitization entities 
during the third quarter of  we engaged in a resecuritization transaction primarily for the purpose of obtaining permanent non recourse financing on a portion of our residential securities portfolio 
many of the entities we have sponsored or managed are currently  or have been historically  recorded on our consolidated balance sheets for 
table of contents financial reporting purposes based upon applicable accounting guidance set forth by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
however  each of these securitization entities is independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities are not owned by and are not legal obligations of ours  although we are exposed to certain financial risks associated with our role as the sponsor or manager of these entities 
for tax purposes  we are structured as a reit 
as a reit  we are able to pass through substantially all of our earnings to our stockholders without paying income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain and on the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
business update fourth quarter we continued to make operational progress in the fourth quarter of we added warehouse financing lines for the residential loan business and continued to add loan sellers 
we originated million of commercial loans in the fourth quarter  more than in any quarter since we began rebuilding our commercial platform in still  progress is not apparent in our financial results 
we reported a gaap loss of million  or per share  for the fourth quarter of  as compared to net income of million  or per share  for the third quarter of this loss reflected impairments on securities and a higher loan loss provision  as well as continued albeit lower negative market valuation adjustments related to the cost of managing risks associated with our pipeline of residential loans that we either purchased or planned to purchase 
book value declined by per share in the fourth quarter to at december   as compared to at september  the million decline in book value during the quarter was attributable to unrealized losses on securities million or roughly two thirds of the decline and the impact of paying out dividends in excess of earnings million or roughly one third of the decline 
from january  through mid february  we estimate that approximately million of the unrealized losses on securities in the fourth quarter was recovered due to the recent rally in rmbs prices 
looking ahead  our focus for includes i improving our capital efficiency and enhancing the returns on our existing investments by funding all residential loans through warehouse lines  applying prudent financial leverage to our residential securities portfolio  and obtaining debt financing for our commercial loan portfolio  ii fully investing our excess capital at attractive yields  and  iii continuing to enhance the franchise value of our residential and commercial loan businesses 
we expect  overall  to invest to million of capital in and believe we can generate the capital needed for the vast majority of this overall investment activity as well as our intended dividends on existing shares of common stock through cash from operations  principal payments from our investments  asset sales  and debt financing we expect to obtain for our commercial loan portfolio 
we expect that our planned increase in investment activity  net of our additional funding costs excluding the other consolidated entities  would positively affect net interest income in the second half of we also expect an increased pace of loan acquisitions in our residential loan business in and an increased number of residential securitizations relative to we may additionally sell some of our residential loans to whole loan buyers rather than securitize them 
still  we expect it will take time to fully benefit from investing our excess capital and  although we expect an improvement in profitability over the course of  we project that any improvement would be more apparent towards the end of residential loan business we continue to make steady operating progress in our residential loan business adding loan sellers  buying loans  and establishing financing relationships 
we currently have twenty active sellers 
we acquired million principal balance of loans in the fourth quarter of  as compared to million in loans purchased in the third quarter of at december   there were million held for sale residential loans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and another million in loans at various stages of origination that we planned to purchase 
we did not sponsor a residential securitization in the fourth quarter of rather  we prepared for the million securitization that we completed in january at february   loans purchased and held on our balance sheet for future securitization totaled million and the pipeline of residential mortgage loans we plan to purchase totaled million 

table of contents of the million in short term debt on our balance sheet at december   million related to warehouse facilities used to finance the accumulation of residential loans 
we plan to finance residential loans with warehouse facilities to reduce the equity capital needed to fund loans 
this may enable us to invest additional equity capital in higher yielding residential securities and commercial loans 
in the long run  we believe our loan conduit and securitization platform will deliver attractive value to shareholders both as a potential profit center from its stand alone activities and as a source of attractive investment securities for our portfolio business 
the stand alone activities could include the acquisition of residential whole loans from originators for sale to newly created sequoia securitization entities that create and sell securities backed by these loans 
we may also sell these whole loans through bulk sale transactions if pricing is more attractive than issuing a securitization 
we may also use our conduit sourcing relationships to acquire and sell loans for a fee under private label investor programs and potentially for sourcing loans for sale to government sponsored enterprises gses 
our residential loan business has garnered interest from policymakers  federal regulators  and other market participants  and facilitated business opportunities that we may not have otherwise had the chance to consider 
our objective for is to acquire approximately billion of residential loans from thirty to forty originators 
we are now planning four to six securitization transactions  including one transaction that we completed in january our business decision either to securitize or sell as whole loans the residential loans we accumulate remains fluid and will be based on balancing our best value execution and the potential franchise value of building out our securitization platform 
residential portfolio business prices for residential mortgage backed securities rmbs generally trended downward from april through december a generally greater aversion to risk by investors appeared to be the biggest driver of the price declines  although decreased availability of financing for rmbs acquisitions may have also played a role 
over the period from april through december  the steepest price declines in rmbs were in those backed by lower quality subprime and alt a collateral 
market pricing for rmbs has since firmed in early during the fourth quarter of  we invested million in third party rmbs 
we did not acquire securities created through our residential loan business in the fourth quarter  as we did not sponsor a securitization in the fourth quarter of we continue to work to source attractive third party rmbs investments through competitive bidding against wall street firms and other market participants  as we have done throughout our history 
competition from other bidders is likely to be significant in  however  as the overall supply of private label rmbs continues to decline 
the outstanding balance of private label rmbs has declined from over trillion in to approximately trillion today 
we have issued the only four new private label residential securitizations backed by prime residential loans since the onset of the financial crisis 
the limited supply dynamic may support asset prices barring idiosyncratic and other risks  which could materialize  but over time will likely produce a headwind to sourcing attractive residential securities investments solely through the competitive bidding process 
for  we expect to invest million of capital in third party rmbs and to million of capital in new sequoia securitizations 
through february   we made million of long term investments in rmbs that included million of third party rmbs  and million of securities from our sequoia securitization in january we financed these investments with a combination of short term debt and million of equity 
we did not sell assets in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  through february   we sold million market value of rmbs for an anticipated million realized gain for gaap reporting purposes 
we expect the gaap yields on new equity capital invested in residential securities during to range from to  after giving effect to our planned use of short term debt financing for these investments 
these figures are estimates  as the markets and our investment opportunities remain fluid 
we generally intend to more efficiently deploy the equity capital held against our securities portfolio in by using what we believe to be modest short term debt financing and in some cases selling securities that no longer fit our portfolio strategy 

table of contents commercial loan business we believe we have made good progress in our commercial loan business and our commercial origination platform continues to grow 
in  the first full year of operations for this origination platform  we originated million of commercial mezzanine loans and ended the year with a portfolio of fourteen loans totaling million 
this included million of investments we made in the fourth quarter of through february   we originated three additional investments through this platform  including mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments  of million 
our commercial portfolio is currently funded entirely by equity capital 
the annualized gaap yield on this portfolio at december   was  before any potential credit costs 
to enhance this yield and free up equity capital for additional investments  we are attempting to obtain what we believe to be a prudent amount of debt financing for this portfolio in while there are headwinds in the economy and certain sectors of the commercial market are struggling  the credit fundamentals for the higher quality  stabilized properties that we seek to finance continue to improve 
we expect that the increased level of loan maturities occurring in the next several years across the industry will allow us to expand and sustain our commercial origination franchise  given our relationships and our willingness to hold credit risk on our balance sheet 
our origination platform sources investment opportunities nationally  including origination through a network of mortgage banking correspondents that currently includes fifteen different firms 
by working closely with banks  insurance companies  and other originators  we reviewed over seven hundred lending opportunities in cumulatively  through february   we have originated mezzanine commercial loans in conjunction with eleven different senior lenders and we are recognized in the industry as a reliable provider of mezzanine financing for high quality  long term  stabilized properties 
as a result of the franchise and relationships we have built over the last two years through our commercial loan business  we are optimistic about our opportunities as the current market cycle evolves 
we currently anticipate originating between and million of subordinate debt investments in  while continuing to maintain our disciplined approach to underwriting as we work to expand this origination platform 
our origination volume may be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing and availability of investment opportunities 
outlook we want to return to delivering a growing stream of dividends through our residential and commercial credit businesses 
our reit structure  while valuable and efficient from a tax perspective  can present a hurdle to growth  as we are required to pay out at least of our earnings as dividends 
to efficiently fund growth and create shareholder value  we ultimately need to be in a position to issue equity at a price per share that is above our gaap book value per share 
to do so  we need to demonstrate to investors the franchise value of our businesses by delivering to shareholders sustainable and attractive returns 
we believe that generating sustainable returns requires a significant market opportunity for new investments and competitive advantages 
we believe that to generate attractive returns we have to make sound risk adjusted credit investments and appropriately manage the liability and equity aspects of our balance sheet 
our investment opportunities lie in the trillion market for residential and commercial mortgages 
our core strength is a deep knowledge of residential and commercial credit and structuring 
we have long standing relationships with lenders and investors in senior residential and commercial securities and we believe we have an outstanding brand 
we are patient  long term investors willing to hold long term illiquid investments that we expect will generate attractive returns 
our macro outlook for the broad investment landscape over the next few years shapes our operating strategies 
on the investment supply side  we believe the current period of consumer and business de leveraging will continue for some time 
as a consequence  less real estate related debt outside of that guaranteed by the united states government will be originated by banks and other financial institutions and the supply of new assets created through financial structuring has been vastly diminished or eliminated  depending on the product 
on the investment demand side  we are likely to be competing for investments in a 
table of contents near zero interest rate environment against banks  fixed income funds  and hedge funds  whose managers are searching for attractive risk adjusted yields for the significant amounts of capital they are investing 
to grow our businesses and generate attractive returns for shareholders over the long term  we have concluded that we must be willing to create our own investments through our residential and commercial business platforms 
this requires building out these platforms by broadening our lender and senior securities investor relationships  expanding our systems and supporting operations  and effectively and efficiently financing  hedging  and structuring to create new investments 
up front expenses of building out these platforms negatively impacted our earnings and we will continue to incur expense in future periods relating to these build outs 
from a competitive standpoint  however  we believe our businesses have some advantages over other firms that are in or working to enter our industry 
further  we believe our platforms are scalable  which should help to improve our financial results as we work to increase our investment volume during and future years 
when we made the decision to build our residential conduit and securitization platform in late  it was in part premised on our expectation that the us federal government would reduce its participation in the residential mortgage market and that new bank regulations related to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and that the implementation of basel iii bank capital requirements would incent banks to also scale back their participation in this market to the advantage of smaller non bank competitors 
in the fourth quarter of  we saw these assumptions begin to play out as i the temporary increase in the gse conforming loan size limits was allowed to expire on october   ii certain banking institutions either discontinued or scaled back their correspondent lending channels related to increased capital requirements under basel iii  and  iii the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac began exploring a new risk sharing program for its residential business 
while we believe that these are positive developments for our business  we would like to see them develop more quickly than they currently are 
our commercial platform will likely provide us with the best opportunity to invest capital in unlike with our residential conduit platform  we are not competing directly against the gses when funding mortgages and there is approximately trillion of commercial real estate debt maturing over the next four years 
in our opinion  it is unlikely that the commercial banking industry  life insurance companies  or the cmbs market will be able or willing to fully meet the refinancing demand that will result from these maturing debts 
additionally  the stabilized income producing property sector that we seek to finance is currently continuing to experience a broad based recovery in credit fundamentals and property valuations have begun to improve

summary of financial condition  capital resources  and liquidity at december   our total capital was billion  including million in stockholders equity and million of long term debt 
we use our capital to invest in earning assets  meet lender capital requirements  and fund our operations and working capital needs 
we currently do not believe we will need to raise equity capital during the first half of  and may not need to raise equity capital in a material way in the second half of we would consider raising equity or another form of long term capital for new investments if our actual investment opportunities exceed our current plans or if our anticipated funding plans generate less than our anticipated needs  and we felt we had investment opportunities at attractive yields that would not be dilutive to common shareholders 
we estimate that our investment capacity or the amount of capital we have readily available to support long term investments was million at december   similar to the million of estimated capacity at september  we estimate our investment capacity as cash on hand  plus cash we believe we could raise by increasing short term borrowings to finance all of our residential mortgage loans held for securitization  less cash needed to cover short term operations  working capital  and a liquidity cushion 
we will continue to look for ways to leverage our capital without taking undue funding risk before raising new capital

during the fourth quarter of  cash flow generated by our investments in these entities totaled million 
our investments in new sequoia entities  as reported for gaap  totaled million at december  and consisted of ios and subordinate securities 
management s estimate of the non gaap economic value of our investments in these entities was million

our investments in the other consolidated entities  as reported for gaap  totaled million at december  this amount consisted of ios and senior and subordinate securities at legacy sequoia entities as well as our equity at the acacia entities 
management s estimate of the non gaap economic value of our investments in these entities was million 
of this amount  million consisted of ios and million consisted of senior and subordinate securities at legacy sequoia entities 
the remaining million consisted of the value of anticipated management fee income at the acacia entities 
factors affecting management s estimate of economic book value in reviewing our non gaap estimate of economic value  there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider 
the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity is calculated as of a particular point in time based on our existing assets and liabilities or  in certain cases  our estimate of economic value of our existing assets and liabilities  and does not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on that value  most notably the impact of future business activities and cash flows 
as a result  the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value  liquidation value  or our market value as a whole 
amounts we ultimately realize from the disposition of assets or settlement of liabilities may vary significantly from the estimated economic values of those assets and liabilities 
because temporary changes in market conditions can substantially affect our estimate of the economic value of our stockholders equity  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in the economic value of our assets and liabilities are necessarily representative of the effectiveness of our investment strategy or the long term underlying value of our business 
our estimated non gaap economic value is calculated using bid side asset marks or estimated bid side values and offer side marks for our financial liabilities or estimated offered side values  when available  to determine fair value under gaap 
when quoted market prices or observable market data are not available to estimate fair value  we rely on level inputs 
because assets and liabilities classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  the process of calculating economic value is generally subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of economic value  and the use of different assumptions as well as changes in market conditions could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
for gaap  we report as a liability the million outstanding principal amount of our long term debt 
we calculated the million estimate of non gaap economic value of our long term debt based on its stated interest rate using the same valuation process used to fair value our other financial assets and liabilities 

table of contents the differences between the gaap carrying value of our investments in sequoia entities and management s estimate of the non gaap economic value of those investments is set forth above under investments in securitization entities 
results of operations and financial condition the following tables present the results of redwood parent  new sequoia entities sequoia securitization entities issued in and subsequent periods  and other consolidated entities in order to supplement our consolidated gaap results for the years ended december    and the interest income and expense related to the resecuritization we engaged in during the third quarter of are included at redwood parent 
additionally  these tables present the new sequoia entities separately from other consolidated entities to highlight our creation of residential credit investments since the beginning of through our sequoia securitization platform

table of contents the million decrease in net interest income after mva from to was primarily due to a million increase in negative market valuation adjustments during caused by declining values of our derivatives used to hedge our pipeline of residential loans and a million decline in net interest income as increasing balances of earnings assets were offset by a decline in yields and increased borrowings 
we also recorded million of interest expense in related to the resecuritization  which did not exist in the million increase in net interest income after mva from to was primarily due to a decline in negative market valuation adjustments during due to lower impairment charges on subordinate securities  higher interest income of million on securities and loans  and lower long term debt expenses 
net interest income at redwood parent net interest income at redwood was million in  as compared to million in  and million in higher interest income from commercial and residential loans was partially offset by lower interest income from real estate securities and higher borrowings

cash flow from many of our subordinate securities can be volatile and in certain cases eg  when the fair values of certain securities are close to zero any interest income earned can result in unusually high reported yields that are not sustainable and not necessarily meaningful 
interest income from available for sale securities at redwood was million in  as compared to million in  a decline of million 
the decrease was primarily due to declining yields on our portfolio as higher yielding  more credit sensitive investments paid down and were replaced with lower yielding  less credit sensitive investments 
interest income on available for sale securities at redwood was million in  as compared with million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to increased average balances  as acquisitions outpaced sales and principal paydowns 
interest income from trading securities at redwood was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have not acquired or otherwise added to our trading securities at redwood since the first quarter of the decline in interest income from these securities between and is a result of principal paydowns on the notional balances of these investments 
the decline in reported yield is a result of the appreciation in value of these securities 
the appreciation in value during this period was recorded to market valuation adjustments  net  through our consolidated statements of income

table of contents managing our residential loan pipeline as part of our ongoing risk management activities  we attempt to manage the risk of declines in the value of our pipeline of fixed rate and hybrid loans awaiting sale or securitization that would result primarily from a rise in benchmark interest rates 
we are exposed to this risk between the time a mortgage interest rate is established for each loan we plan to acquire  through the time the loan is sold or securitized through our sequoia program 
under normal market conditions and assuming we have hedged well  we would expect our risk management activities including the use of interest rate and other derivatives to reduce our risk exposure to changing interest rates so that the gain or loss in the value of our derivatives would to varying degrees offset a loss or gain in the value of our pipeline of loans 
under more difficult market conditions  such as those we have experienced over recent quarters  navigating through the impact of our ongoing risk management of our residential loan pipeline on our reported gaap results can become increasingly complex 
therefore  we continue to evaluate our disclosures with the goal of making our financial reporting as reflective of the economics of our business as possible under gaap 
one specific change in accounting that we intend to implement in is a transition from a gaap financing accounting model for future near term securitizations to a gaap sale accounting model 
impairment on afs securities we classify most securities at redwood as afs and report any unrealized gains and losses  as well as any otti not related to credit factors  as components of equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
any otti on afs securities that is related to adverse credit factors is recorded through our consolidated statements of income 
similarly  any unrealized losses on afs securities that we no longer intend to hold at the date of the financial statements are recorded as otti through our consolidated statements of income 
during  we recognized an aggregate of million of otti on afs securities at redwood 
of this amount  million was related to credit factors and recognized in our consolidated statements of income  and million was recognized as a reduction in stockholders equity

table of contents while changes in the value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges affect reported book value from quarter to quarter  we have a long term view on these hedges 
for instance  the derivative hedges closely match the terms of our long term debt  which has a remaining life of approximately years 
at some point during this time frame  interest rates may rise  increasing the value of these hedges 
securities at redwood parent we classify most senior  re remic  and subordinate securities as afs securities 
senior securities are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last in line to absorb losses 
of the senior securities owned at redwood at december   million of prime securities and million of non prime securities were financed through a non recourse resecuritization entity 
re remic securities  as presented herein  were created through the resecuritization of certain senior interests to provide additional credit support to those interests 
these re remic securities are therefore subordinate to the remaining senior interest  but senior to any subordinate tranches of the securitization from which they were created 
subordinate securities are all interests below senior and re remic interests 
the commercial and cdo securities that we own are subordinate securities

loan loss provision at legacy sequoia entities each quarter we utilize a loan loss reserving methodology that has been established to provide management with a reasonable and adequate estimate of loan loss reserving needs 
this methodology is disclosed in note and note to the financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
the provision for loan losses at legacy sequoia entities sequoia securitizations issued prior to that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision from to was primarily attributable to the improved performance of our troubled debt restructuring loan population over the course of  as well as a significant decline in the amount of delinquent loans being foreclosed upon and charged off in accordance with our policy 
the provision for loan losses was greater than the net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances for the year ended december   and the provision for loan losses was greater than the net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances for the year ended december  this resulted in an increase of million and million in our allowance for loan losses for the years ended and  respectively 
charge offs were generated by million and million of defaulted loan principal during and  respectively  for average implied loss severities of and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision from to was primarily attributable to a gradual decline in serious delinquencies

this is primarily attributable to the continued building of loan loss allowances in accordance with gaap  resulting in lower asset carrying values 
the aggregate estimated net assets or equity at these fourteen consolidated entities was negative million at december   an amount we expect to reverse through positive adjustments to earnings in future periods as the entities are retired or deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes

loan repurchase risk subsidiaries of redwood have purchased and deposited residential mortgage loans into sequoia securitization trusts sponsored by rwt holdings  inc  a redwood subsidiary 
these trusts have subsequently issued residential mortgage backed securities  some of which are not currently consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes 
in connection with these securitizations  these subsidiaries of redwood made certain representations and warranties related to these loans that could result in an obligation to repurchase these loans to the extent a violation of these representations and warranties occurred 
we do not originate residential loans and believe that risk of loss due to loan repurchases ie  due to a breach of representations and warranties would generally be a contingency to the third party entity from whom we acquired the loans 
however  in some cases  where loans were acquired from entities that have since become insolvent  repurchase claims would not be a contingency to a third party and may result in repurchase claims made against us 
as of december   there have been no loan level repurchase claims made to redwood by investors where the entity that originated the loans in question was insolvent 
as a result  while it is possible that we may receive repurchase claims related to these securitizations in the future  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential future liabilities based on historical experience to date 
we do not currently maintain a loan repurchase reserve and management is not aware of any outstanding repurchase claims against redwood that would require the establishment of such a reserve 
in circumstances where we believe that there is a risk of loss due to a specific loan repurchase demand ie  due to an allegation of a breach of representations and warranties  we will review the need for any loan repurchase reserve in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies and establish reserves when  in the opinion of management  it is probable that a matter would result in a liability and the amount of loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  with respect to residential mortgage backed securities issued by sequoia securitization trusts prior to  we believe that investors seeking recovery for any losses they incur on investments in these securities may be more likely to pursue remedies through securities related litigation rather than through specific loan repurchase claims 
we separately evaluate our exposure to such litigation when assessing whether the establishment of a litigation reserve is necessary under gaap 
for further discussion on litigation related contingencies see note to the financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report on form k

debt at redwood at december   we had million of short term debt outstanding 
for the year ended december   the average balance of short term debt outstanding was million  with a weighted average interest rate of 
for the year ended december   the highest balance of our short term debt outstanding was million 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may utilize short term recourse debt through several different types of borrowing facilities and use cash borrowings under these facilities to  among other things  fund the acquisition of residential loans we acquire in anticipation of securitization  fund the origination of commercial loans  finance investments in securities and other investments  and otherwise fund our business and operations 
at december   we had two residential loan warehouse facilities with a total outstanding debt balance of million secured by residential loans with an aggregate value in excess of the outstanding debt and a total borrowing limit of million 
each residential loan financed under one of our residential loan warehouse facilities can only be financed for a maximum number of days generally less than months  after which the financing expires and must be repaid 
we generally intend to repay the short term financing of a loan under one of those facilities at or prior to the expiration of that financing with the proceeds of a securitization or other sale of that loan  through the proceeds of other short term borrowings  or with other equity or long term debt capital 
in addition  at december   we had an aggregate outstanding short term debt balance of million under four securities repurchase facilities secured by securities with a fair market value of approximately million 
the financing for each security financed under one of our securities repurchase facilities is limited in its initial duration to a maximum number of days generally days or less 
we generally intend to repay the short term financing of a security under one of these facilities through a renewal of that financing with the same counterparty  through a sale of the security  or with other equity or long term debt capital 
at december   we also had one secured line of credit with no outstanding debt balance and a total borrowing limit of million secured by securities with a fair market value in excess of million 
during the first quarter of  we established two additional securities repurchase facilities with financial institution counterparties 
at december   we had million of short term debt collateralized by mortgage backed securities that was used to fund the acquisition of mortgage loans that we intended to securitize 
this debt matured and was repaid in march  near the time those mortgage loans were securitized 
in and  we issued a total of million and million of long term debt  respectively 
this debt requires quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed in whole 
beginning in the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps with aggregate notional values currently totaling million to hedge the variability in our long term debt interest expense  fixing our gross interest expense yield at 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges with all interest income recorded as a component of net interest income and other valuation changes recorded as a component of equity 
asset backed securities issued at the resecuritization entity in july  redwood transferred million of residential securities into a resecuritization trust  with million of abs issued to third parties 
at december   there were million of securities owned at the resecuritization  which were funded with million of abs issued 
since resecuritization  the abs issued has paid down million 

table of contents asset backed securities issued at securitization entities at december   there were billion of loans owned at sequoia securitization entities  which were funded with billion of abs issued at sequoia entities 
these loans and abs issued are reported at their unpaid principal balances net of any unamortized premium or discount 
to date  credit losses have not yet been incurred on any of the senior securities issued by consolidated sequoia securitization entities  although we expect that some of these senior securities may incur losses in the future  depending on the magnitude and timing of additional credit losses incurred on the underlying loans 
at december   there were million of securities owned by acacia securitization entities and reported at fair value  which were funded with million of abs issued by acacia entities that were also reported at fair value

all consolidated abs issued are collateralized by real estate loans and securities 
although the stated maturity is as shown  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal balances of these real estate loans or securities pay down 
the amount shown is the principal balance of the abs issued and not necessarily the value reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated interest payments on consolidated abs issued is calculated based on the contractual maturity of the abs and therefore assumes no prepayments of the principal outstanding at december  
table of contents potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility from our business activities 
this volatility can occur for a variety of reasons  including the timing and amount of purchases  sales  calls  and repayment of consolidated assets  changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities  and certain non recurring events 
in addition  the amount or timing of our reported earnings may be impacted by technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
changes in premium amortization for loans the net unamortized premium for loans owned at sequoia entities and at redwood was million at december  the amount of periodic premium amortization expense we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
loan premium amortization was million in the both and changes in allowance for loan losses for real estate loans classified as held for investment  we establish and maintain an allowance for loan losses based on our estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios at the reporting date 
to calculate the allowance for loan losses  we assess inherent losses by determining loss factors defaults  loss severities on default liquidations  and the timing of default liquidations that can be specifically applied to each of the consolidated loans or pools of loans 
changes in actual defaults or our expectations on loss severities and default timing can have a significant effect on periodic income 
changes in the fair value of residential and commercial loans classified as held for sale the majority of unsecuritized residential loans on our consolidated balance sheets are being held for future securitizations and will be sold to non consolidated entities 
at the time of purchase  we may elect the fair value option for these loans or classify them as held for sale 
for loans for which we have elected the fair value option  changes in fair values are recorded in market valuation adjustments through the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the valuation change occurs 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant period to period gaap earnings volatility 
loans classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of their cost basis or fair value 
if the fair value of loans classified as held for sale is lower than their cost basis  the difference is reported as a negative market valuation adjustment through our consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of loans is affected by  among other things  changes in interest rates  credit performance  prepayments  and market liquidity 
to the extent interest rates change or market liquidity and or credit conditions materially change  the value of these loans could decline below their cost basis  which could have a material effect on reported earnings 
changes in yields for securities the yields we project on real estate securities can have a significant effect on the periodic interest income we recognize for financial reporting purposes 
yields can vary as a function of credit results  prepayment rates  and interest rates 
if estimated future credit losses are less than our prior estimate  credit losses occur later than expected  or prepayment rates are faster than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is greater than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to principal balance  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted upwards 
if estimated future credit losses exceed our prior expectations  credit losses occur more quickly than expected  or prepayments occur more slowly than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is less than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to principal balance  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted downward 

table of contents changes in the actual maturities of real estate securities may also affect their yields to maturity 
actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the associated mortgage collateral  periodic payments of principal  and prepayments of principal 
therefore  actual maturities of afs securities are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities 
stated contractual maturities are generally greater than ten years 
there is no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows or the current period s yield for each asset will not change in the near term  and any change could be material 
changes in fair values of securities all securities owned at redwood and consolidated entities are classified as either trading or afs securities  and in both cases are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
for trading securities  changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
for afs securities  cumulative unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in our consolidated statements of changes in equity 
unrealized gains and losses are not charged against current earnings to the extent they are temporary in nature 
certain factors may require us  however  to recognize these amounts as other than temporary impairments and record them through our current earnings 
factors that determine other than temporary impairment include a change in our ability or intent to hold assets  adverse changes to projected cash flows of assets  or the likelihood that declines in the fair values of assets would not return to their previous levels within a reasonable time 
impairments can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments we can experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
we generally use derivatives to manage risks associated with residential loans we own or plan to acquire and securitize  commercial loans we own  variability in interest expense indexed to adjustable rates  and cash flows on assets and liabilities that have different coupon rates fixed rates versus floating rates  or floating rates based on different indices 
the nature of the instruments we use and the accounting treatment for the specific assets  liabilities  and derivatives may therefore lead to volatility in our periodic earnings  even when we are meeting our hedging objectives 
some of our derivatives are accounted for as trading instruments with all associated changes in value recorded through our consolidated statements of income 
changes in value of the assets and liabilities we manage by using derivatives may not be accounted for similarly 
this could lead to reported income and book values in specific periods that do not necessarily reflect the economics of our risk management strategy 
even when the assets and liabilities are similarly accounted for as trading instruments  periodic changes in their values may not coincide as other market factors eg  supply and demand may affect certain instruments and not others at any given time 
changes in loss contingency reserves we may be exposed to various loss contingencies  including  without limitation  those described in note to the financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  we review the need for any loss contingency reserves and establish them when  in the opinion of management  it is probable that a matter would result in a liability  and the amount of loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
the establishment of a loss contingency reserve  the subsequent increase in a reserve or release of reserves previously established  or the recognition of a loss in excess of previously established reserves  can occur as a result of various factors and events that affect management s opinion of whether the standard for establishing  increasing  or continuing to maintain  a reserve has been met 
changes in the loss contingency reserves can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter

in order to utilize these carry forwards  taxable income must exceed our dividend distributions 
during  we distributed million to shareholders and exceeded our distribution requirement 
we do not expect to report any reit taxable income on our federal income tax return after the application of a dividends paid deduction 
as a result  we do not expect any of our federal nols at the reit level to be utilized in federal nols at the reit level do not expire until federal nols at the trs level expire between and federal capital loss carry forwards of million and million at the reit and trs  respectively  will expire between and in order to utilize these carry forwards  the respective entities must recognize capital gains in excess of capital losses before the expiration dates 
utilization of capital loss carry forwards by the reit reduces the reit s taxable income and distribution requirement 
capital loss carry forwards do not reduce the taxability of dividends to shareholders 

table of contents tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the year ended december   we declared and distributed four regular quarterly dividends totaling per share 
under the federal income tax rules applicable to reits  the taxable portion of any distribution to shareholders in excess of the minimum requirement is determined by i taxable income of the reit  exclusive of the dividends paid deduction and nols  and  ii net capital gains recognized by the reit  exclusive of capital loss carry forwards 
our dividend distributions are expected to be characterized for income tax purposes as ordinary income and return of capital 
thus  we expect approximately million of our dividend distributions to be characterized as ordinary income to shareholders  as this amount represents the taxable income we generated in prior to the application of a dividends paid deduction and nols in accordance with federal income tax rules 
of this amount  none is attributable to net capital gains recognized for tax purposes 
the remaining million of dividend distributions are expected to be characterized as a return of capital to shareholders and are generally not taxable 
a distribution of capital reduces the tax basis for common shares held by a shareholder at each quarterly distribution date provided the distribution does not exceed a shareholder s tax basis in our common shares 
in november  our board of directors announced its intention to pay a regular dividend of per share  per quarter in differences between estimated taxable income and gaap income differences between estimated taxable income and gaap income are largely due to the following i we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but can for gaap as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses are anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for gaap  ii the timing  and possibly the amount  of some expenses eg  compensation expenses are different for tax than for gaap  iii since amortization and impairments differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap gains and losses on sales may differ  resulting in differences in realized gains on sale  iv for tax  realized capital gains on sales may be offset by prior capital losses  v unrealized gains and losses on market valuation adjustments of securities and derivatives are not recognized for tax until the instrument is sold or extinguished  and  vi for tax  we do not consolidate noncontrolling interests or securitization entities as we do under gaap 
as a result of these differences in accounting  our estimated taxable income can vary significantly from our gaap income during certain reporting periods 
the redwood reit s tax basis in its assets and liabilities was billion and billion  respectively  at december  the redwood reit s gaap basis in its assets and liabilities was billion and billion  respectively  at december  the primary difference in both the tax and gaap assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for gaap reporting purposes but not for tax purposes

table of contents potential taxable income volatility we expect period to period estimated taxable income volatility for a variety of reasons  including those described below 
credit losses on securities and loans to determine estimated taxable income  we are generally not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount 
for tax purposes  we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security 
estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur 
for gaap purposes  we establish a credit reserve and only accrete a portion of the purchase discount  if any  into income and write down securities that become impaired 
our income recognition is therefore faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning a security when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized cost basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo subordinate securities excluding our investments in our securitization entities was million 
as we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax  any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on gaap earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods 
during the years ended december  and  we realized million and million  respectively  of credit losses on securities for tax that we had previously provisioned for under gaap 
we anticipate that credit losses will continue to be a significant factor for determining taxable income 
credit losses are based on our tax basis  which differs materially from our basis for gaap purposes 
we anticipate an additional million of credit losses for tax on securities  based on our projection of principal balance losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced  although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project 
at december   for gaap we had a designated credit reserve of million on our securities  and an allowance for loan losses of million for our consolidated residential and commercial loans 
recognition of gains and losses on sale since amortization and impairments on assets differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap basis on assets sold or called may differ  resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call 
in addition  gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and  thus  not affect taxable income 
at december   the reit had an estimated million in capital loss carry forwards per share that can be used to offset future capital gains over the next three to five years 
since our intention is to generally invest in assets for the long term  it is difficult to anticipate when sales may occur and  thus  when or whether we might exhaust these capital loss carry forwards 
prepayments on securities as part of our investment in sequoia securitization entities  we have retained ios at the time they are issued 
our current tax basis in these securities is million 
the return on ios is sensitive to prepayments and  to the extent prepayments vary period to period  income from these ios will vary 
typically  fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields 
we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules  so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced 
in periods prior to  we did experience fast prepayments on the loans underlying our ios 
more recently  prepayments have been slowing  and our tax basis is now below the fair values for these ios in the aggregate 
most of our sequoia securitizations are callable or will become callable over the next two years  although we do not currently anticipate calling any sequoia securitizations in the foreseeable future 
if we do call a sequoia securitization  the remaining tax basis in the io is written off  creating an ordinary loss at the call date 

table of contents prepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own 
we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security 
as actual prepayment speeds vary  the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly 
thus  to the extent prepayments differ from our long term assumptions or vary from period to period  the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material for a specific security 
compensation expense the total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units and preferred stock units  and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for gaap  the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise  not the award date 
in addition  some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels and is not performance based 
thus  the total amount of compensation expense  as well as the timing  could be significantly different for tax than for gaap 
as an example  for gaap we expense the grant date fair value of psus granted over the vesting term of those psus regardless of the degree to which the performance conditions for vesting are ultimately satisfied  if at all  whereas for tax the value of the psus that actually vest in accordance with the performance conditions of those awards and are subsequently distributed to the award recipient is recorded as an expense on the date of distribution 
if no psus under a particular grant ultimately vest  due to the failure to satisfy the performance conditions  no tax expense will be recorded for those psus  even though we would have already recorded expense for gaap equal to the grant date fair value of the psu awards 
conversely  if performance is such that a number of shares of common stock equal to of the psu award ultimately vest and are delivered to the award recipient  expense for tax will equal the common stock value on the date of distribution of of the number of psus originally granted 
this expense for tax could significantly exceed the recorded expense for gaap 
in addition  since the decision to exercise options or distribute deferred stock units  preferred stock units  or cash out of the executive deferred compensation plan is an employee s  it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of critical accounting policies and the possible effects of changes in estimates on our financial statements is included in note summary of significant accounting policies included in item of this annual report on form k 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and fair value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
this section presents a general overview of these risks 
additional information concerning the risks we are managing  how these risks are changing over time  and potential gaap earnings and taxable income volatility we may experience as a result of these risks is further discussed in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming the credit risk of real estate loans primarily through the ownership of residential and commercial loans and securities 
some of our capital base is employed in owning credit enhancement securities that have below investment grade credit ratings due to their concentrated credit risks with respect to underlying real estate loans and investment grade securities 
we believe that many of the loans underlying these securities are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general although there may nevertheless be significant credit losses related to these loans 
we may also own residential loans that are not securitized 
credit losses from the loans in securitized loan pools  in general  first reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the lower rated securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens further than we have anticipated  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses on real estate loans can vary for reasons not related to the general economy 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan securities we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these loans  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we also own securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers  some of which are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans and a few are subprime loans 
we invest in these riskier loan types with the expectation of significantly higher delinquencies and losses as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
the commercial loans we credit enhance are typically fixed rate loans  the majority of which are interest only loans 
in general  these loans are subordinate to other financings of the same commercial property and not fully amortizing and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we could be exposed to credit losses at the maturity of these loans if the borrower is unable to repay or refinance the borrowing with another third party lender 
we will experience credit losses on residential and commercial loans and securities  and to the extent the losses are consistent with the amount and timing of our assumptions  we expect to earn attractive returns on our investments 
we manage our credit risks by analyzing the extent of the risk we are taking and reviewing whether we believe the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to monitor the ongoing credit performance of each loan and security 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific 
table of contents assets are changing adversely  we may be able to take actions which may include selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in analyzing risks  reviewing underwriting criteria  foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses and the ability to sell an asset may be limited due to the structure of the asset or the absence of a liquid market for the asset 
in addition to residential and commercial subordinate securities  redwood and acacia own senior and other securities issued by securitization entities that are sponsored by others 
a risk we face with respect to these securities is that we do not generally control or influence the underwriting  servicing  management  or loss mitigation with respect to these underlying loans 
the acacia entities and redwood also own securities backed by subprime and alt a residential loans that have substantially higher credit risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
consequently  we can expect these lower quality loans to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and if such losses differ from our assumptions  acacia  and redwood could suffer losses 
the acacia entities also own certain senior securities and subordinate securities purchased from the sequoia securitization entities we sponsor 
if the pools of residential and commercial loans underlying these securities were to experience poor credit results  these securities could suffer decreases in fair value  or could experience principal losses 
if any of these events occurs  it would likely reduce our returns from these investments 
we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our business counterparties 
for example  counterparties we acquire loans from  lend to  or invest in  make representations and warranties and covenants to us  and may also indemnify us against certain losses 
to the extent we have suffered a loss and are entitled to enforce those agreements to recover damages  if our counterparties are insolvent or unable or unwilling to comply with these agreements we would suffer a loss due to the credit risk associated with our counterparties 
as an example  under short term borrowing facilities and swap and other derivative agreements  we sometimes transfer assets as collateral to our counterparties 
to the extent counterparty is not able to return this collateral to us if and when we are entitled its return  we could suffer a loss due to the credit risk associated with that counterparty 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and derivative financial instruments and  consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity in order to accomplish our goal of achieving attractive long term returns 
to implement our interest rate risk strategy  we may use derivative financial instruments in an effort to maintain a close match between pledged assets and debt  as well as between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued 
however  we generally do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates  and at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
prepayments affect gaap earnings in the near term primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount and through triggering market valuation adjustments 
for example  amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expense from premium assets  and vice versa 
in addition  variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets 
table of contents and changes in interest rates as they affect projected coupons on arms and other assets and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
moreover  the timing of premium amortization on assets may not always match the timing of the premium amortization on liabilities even when the underlying assets and liabilities are in the same securitization and pay down at the same rate 
prepayment risks exist in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as ios benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
we note that changes in residential loan prepayment rates could result in gaap and tax earnings volatility 
with respect to securities backed by residential mortgage loans and in particular  ios  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market values of those securities sold by securitization entities  and thus could affect the economics associated with securitizing assets 
our credit results and risks can also be affected by prepayments 
for example  credit risks for the securities we own are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
we caution that prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividend distribution requirements 
arm prepayment rates  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
however  for borrowers who have impaired credit or who otherwise do not meet loan underwriting criteria  the ability to refinance ie  prepay a loan even when interest rates decline may be limited 
fair value and liquidity risks the residential loans and securities that we acquire are generally funded with a combination of short term recourse debt and equity or long term debt and our use of short term debt to finance these assets might affect our liquidity position 
the assets and liabilities at acacia are accounted for under the fair value option  with all changes in market values being recorded through our income statement 
though this potentially creates earnings volatility  the securities and abs issued by acacia entities have no recourse to us that would otherwise affect our liquidity position 
in addition  securities that we included in the resecuritization we engaged in during the third quarter of are legally owned by the resecuritization entity and we are not able to sell these securities as a means of protecting ourselves from any declines in the fair value of these securities 
most of the real estate loans that we consolidate are accounted for using the held for investment gaap classification and are reported at their amortized cost 
most of these loans have been for legal purposes sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the fair value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with short term debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may also own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value may be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
changes in fair value of abs issued have no impact on our liquidity 
abs issued by sequoia and the resecuritization we engaged in during the third quarter of are reported at amortized cost 
we report at fair value the abs issued by acacia and also report the underlying securities collateralizing the abs issued at fair value 
in either case  the resulting net equity assets less liabilities may not necessarily be reflective of the fair value of our interests in these securitization entities 
however  since the abs issued can only look to the cash flows generated by the assets within that securitization entity for payments of interest and repayments of the principal balance of the abs  the changes in fair value do not have an effect on redwood s liquidity 
only to the extent that changes in fair values affect the timing of the cash flows we might receive on our investments in consolidated entities is there an effect to redwood from changes in fair values of these investments 

table of contents we fund some assets with a combination of short term debt and equity that is recourse to redwood 
this generally increases our fair value and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have a variety of financing facilities available to fund each of our assets 
we also manage risk by hedging the loans held for securitization to minimize the fluctuations in value prior to securitization 
under short term borrowing facilities and swap and other derivatives agreements  we pledge assets as security for our payment obligations and make various representations and warranties and agree to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms 
in addition  our short term borrowing facilities are generally uncommitted  meaning that each time we request a new borrowing under a facility the lender has the option to decline to extend credit to us 
the terms of these facilities and agreements typically include financial covenants such as covenants to maintain a minimum amount of tangible net worth or stockholders equity and or a minimum amount of liquid assets  margin requirements which typically require us to pledge additional collateral if and when the value of previously pledged collateral declines  operating covenants such as covenants to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and covenants to provide notice of certain events to creditors  representations and warranties such as representations and warranties relating to characteristics of pledged collateral  our exposure to litigation and or regulatory enforcement actions and the absence of material adverse changes to our financial condition  our operations  or our business prospects  and events of default such as a breach of covenant or representation warranty and cross defaults  under which an event of default is triggered under a credit facility if an event of default or similar event occurs under another credit facility 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage fair value and liquidity risks  we are exposed to these types of risks due to  among other things  our use of short term borrowing facilities and our use of interest rate swaps and other derivatives 
for example  if there is a decline in value of assets we have pledged to collateralize our obligations under a swap or other derivative or to collateralize our borrowings under a short term borrowing facility  we would be obligated in response to a margin call to pledge additional collateral  which could occur at a time when we do not have additional collateral available to pledge 
as another example  if we breach a covenant or representation warranty in a short term borrowing facility  or if a default occurs under one of these facilities or agreements  we could be obligated to repay all outstanding borrowings under that credit facility  which could occur at a time when we do not have cash or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to satisfy our obligations 
similarly  under a swap or derivative agreement  following a breach or default  we could be obligated to make a termination payment to our counterparty  which could also occur at a time when we do not have cash or other liquid assets in an amount sufficient to satisfy our obligations 
in addition  because these borrowing facilities and swap and derivatives agreements generally contain cross default provisions  if we become obligated to repay borrowings under one facility or to make a termination payment under a swap or derivative agreement  our creditors under other facilities or agreements may exercise their right to require us to make payments or repay the borrowings under the agreements they have with us or under borrowing facilities they have extended to us 
to the extent we become obligated to pledge assets or make payments at a time when we do not have sufficient cash or assets available  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
separately  inflation or deflation in home prices can affect our credit risk 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation 

table of contents risks relating to litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions our business exposes us to risks relating to litigation and governmental investigations and enforcement actions 
for example  through certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries we have engaged in securitization transactions relating to residential mortgage loans and other types of assets 
in the future we plan to continue to engage in securitization transactions relating to residential mortgage loans and may also engage in other types of securitization transactions or other similar types of transactions 
as a result of engaging in this business  we have already been the subject of litigation and have received an inquiry and a subpoena  respectively  from two different governmental authorities in connection with their broad based investigations of certain aspects of certain securitization markets and issuances 
redwood asset management  inc  one of our subsidiaries  is registered with the sec as an investment adviser and provides investment advisory services to certain entities that we sponsored that issued collateralized debt obligations and has  in the past  provided investment advisory services to a limited partnership fund we sponsored 
redwood asset management could be exposed to litigation by investors in entities to which it provides investment advisory services or it could be the subject of a governmental investigation or enforcement action  in each case  as a result of the manner in which it conducts its advisory activities 
redwood residential acquisition corporation  one of our subsidiaries  is licensed by various states in connection with its acquisitions of residential mortgage loans originated by others and is required to comply with rules and regulations promulgated by federal and state agencies in connection with the conduct of its business 
redwood residential acquisition corporation could be exposed to litigation by mortgage borrowers or could be the subject of a governmental investigation or enforcement action  in each case  as a result of the manner in which it conducts its business 
similarly  redwood commercial mortgage corporation is licensed by the state of california to engage in commercial real estate lending and could be exposed to litigation or enforcement actions as a result of the manner in which it conducts its business 
securitization entities that we sponsored issued abs backed by residential mortgage loans and other assets held by these entities 
as a result of declining property values  the recent economic recession  increased defaults  and other factors  the cash flows from the loans and other assets held by these securitization entities will not be sufficient  in some cases  to repay in full the principal amount of abs issued by these securitization entities 
we are not contractually liable for the principal and interest payments due on the abs issued by these entities 
nonetheless  third parties who have invested in the abs issued by these entities could try to hold us liable for any losses they experience  including through claims under federal and state securities laws or claims for breaches of representations and warranties we made in connection with engaging in these securitization transactions 
three lawsuits have been brought by investors in two of our different sequoia securitizations  with two of these three lawsuits having been brought by members of the federal home loan bank system namely  the federal home loan bank of seattle and the federal home loan bank of chicago 
these lawsuits are discussed above in note commitments and contingencies loss contingencies litigation within the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth within part iv  item of this annual report on form k and are also discussed above within part i  item of this annual report on form k 
defending a lawsuit can consume significant resources and may divert management s attention from our operations 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in our defense of any lawsuit  we could suffer losses  which could be material 
in addition to the federal home loan banks noted above  various other federal home loan banks that make up the federal home loan bank system are pursuing litigation against various parties in relation to their respective portfolio holdings of rmbs 
we have not been named in litigation brought by these other federal home loan banks to date  although some of them did purchase sequoia rmbs at original issuance 
as examples  i in september and october  the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh initiated litigation against various rmbs market participants relating to rmbs held within its portfolio  ii in march  the federal home loan bank of san francisco initiated litigation against various rmbs market participants relating to rmbs held within its portfolio  iii in january  the federal home loan bank of atlanta initiated litigation against various rmbs market participants relating to rmbs held within its portfolio  and iv in april  the federal home loan bank of boston initiated litigation against various rmbs market participants relating to rmbs held within its portfolio 
there are a total of twelve federal home loan banks within the federal home loan bank system and those that have not yet initiated litigation or demands of the type described above may do so in the future and those that have already initiated litigation 
table of contents or demands of the type described above may expand the scope of the litigation or demands that they have initiated to date 
any newly initiated or expanded litigation or demands by the federal home loan banks may include new or additional demands or litigation against us or our subsidiaries to the extent that federal home loan banks purchased at issuance or in the secondary market rmbs issued through our sequoia rmbs platform 
other investors in rmbs and other types of abs have also initiated various legal actions against participants in the market for these types of abs and those that invested in rmbs and collateralized debt obligations issued in transactions we sponsored may initiate legal actions against us  particularly if the parties who have already initiated legal actions against us or others are successful  in whole or in part  in the pursuit of their claims 
various governmental authorities have also initiated investigations  enforcement actions  and litigation with respect to  among other things  the mortgage finance markets  rmbs transactions  and collateralized debt obligation transactions and the market participants who structured  sponsored  marketed  or sold transactions or securities relating to these markets and securities 
for example in  goldman sachs reached a million settlement relating to civil charges brought by the sec relating to goldman sachs role in structuring and marketing a synthetic collateralized debt obligation transaction referred to as abacus ac other examples relating to collateralized debt obligations include i in the sec initiated an action against an asset management firm named icp asset management and certain other related entities and individuals alleging violations of law by icp in the conduct of its business as the collateral manager of various collateralized debt obligation transactions and ii in october  the sec charged citigroup s principal us broker dealer subsidiary with misleading investors about a billion collateralized debt obligation transaction  which charges were settled pursuant to an agreement under which citigroup paid a total of million to be distributed to investors in that transaction 
another example relating to rmbs is that in the federal housing finance agency fhfa  which is the federal agency that regulates fannie mae  freddie mac  and the federal home loan banks  issued subpoenas to institutions that participated in rmbs transactions in which fannie mae or freddie mac invested  as part of a financial inquiry that is seeking information to determine whether losses sustained by fannie mae and freddie mac from these investments are the legal responsibility of others and to ensure that the obligations of the various parties involved have been met 
in september  the fhfa filed lawsuits against financial institutions  certain of their officers and various unaffiliated lead underwriters  which suits allege violations of federal securities laws and common law in the sale of rmbs to fannie mae and freddie mac 
our business has included  and continues to include  activities relating to securitization transactions  an area that is the focus of various governmental authorities 
because of our involvement in the securitization business  we could become the subject of governmental investigations  enforcement actions  or lawsuits  and governmental authorities could allege that we violated applicable law or regulation in the conduct of our business 
if violations are so alleged  we might not be successful in defending any related action brought against us  and any losses incurred as a result of the resolution of any such action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
in any case  regardless of the merits of any allegation or legal action that may be brought against us  or of our success in defending against it  the costs of defending against any such allegation or legal action made or brought against us may be significant or material and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
to the extent that any action is brought against us or other market participants by any governmental authority  regardless of whether that action is successful or not  it could result in non governmental litigants bringing similar actions against us to the extent the law permits private parties to pursue legal action to address alleged violations of law or regulation 
as part of investigations they have been conducting  we have been required to provide information to two different federal agencies 
within part i  item of this annual report on form k  we describe i the inquiry we received from the sec  which inquiry took the form of an order to provide certain information regarding our past business activities with respect to sponsoring collateralized debt obligation transactions  and ii the subpoena we received from the national credit union administration relating to certain rmbs transactions we sponsored in the past 
we have responded to the order from the sec and the subpoena from the ncua 
both the subpoena from the ncua and the order from the sec state that they should not be construed as an indication that any violation of law has occurred  however  these regulatory agencies could  in 
table of contents the future  allege that we did violate applicable law or regulation in the conduct of our securitization business and  if either of them were to make such an allegation  it is possible that we might not be successful in defending any related action brought against us and any losses incurred as a result of the resolution of any such action against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
as an example  in june the ncua filed federal and state securities law claims in us district court in kansas city  kansas against  among others  certain subsidiaries of jp morgan chase co 
and royal bank of scotland group plc alleging that the offering documents relating to certain rmbs transactions that they sponsored and or underwrote contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts and on july  the ncua filed an additional and similar lawsuit against certain subsidiaries of royal bank of scotland group plc and certain other entities in us district court in los angeles  california 
at the same time the ncua filed its june claims  it announced that it expects to file additional similar lawsuits against other financial institutions 
on june   the wall street journal reported that the ncua is engaged in settlement discussions with financial institutions relating to other rmbs transactions and subsequently the media have reported that the ncua has indicated that it anticipates filing another five to lawsuits relating to the failure of wholesale credit unions 
there have also recently been several notable proposed settlements by large financial institutions of claims related to rmbs transactions 
for example in june  bank of america corporation and certain of its subsidiaries collectively referred to as bank of america reported that it entered into a proposed settlement agreement and a related agreement with certain institutional investors relating to claims for loan servicing breaches relating to  and breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with  certain securitization transactions that had been sponsored by subsidiaries of countrywide financial corporation prior to the acquisition of countrywide financial by bank of america 
the proposed settlement agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  including court approval 
the proposed settlement agreement provides for the release of claims related to breaches of representations and warranties in the covered securitization transactions  all past servicing of loans underlying the covered securitization transactions  and all future servicing of loans underlying the covered securitization transactions to the extent that future servicing complies with newly agreed to standards 
under the proposed settlement  bank of america would make an aggregate payment of billion  which would be allocated among the covered securitization transactions 
in july  subsidiaries of wells fargo company collectively referred to as wells fargo entered into a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought by investors in different rmbs transactions sponsored by wells fargo  which class action lawsuit included claims under the federal securities laws that the offering documents for those rmbs transactions contained untrue statements and omitted material facts 
in settling these claims  wells fargo agreed to a settlement payment to the plaintiff class of approximately million 
the proposed settlement was approved by the court in november in december  merrill lynch co  inc  a subsidiary of bank of america corporation merrill lynch  entered into a proposed settlement of a class action lawsuit brought by investors in different rmbs transactions sponsored by subsidiaries of merrill lynch  which class action lawsuit included claims under the federal securities laws that the offering documents for those rmbs transactions contained untrue statements and omitted material facts 
in settling these claims  merrill lynch agreed to a settlement payment to the plaintiff class of approximately million 
the proposed settlement was approved by the court in december as settlements such as those described above are proposed or entered into  we may analyze them  the nature of the claims and rmbs they relate to  and the circumstances under which they were entered into 
in some cases  these settlements may affect the value of third party issued rmbs that we hold 
we also may seek to determine the extent to which these settlements are relevant to the defense of the lawsuits that we have been named in  to other aspects of our business  and to the reporting of our financial results 
we may not analyze all future settlements that relate to asset backed securities  or we may analyze them but not describe them in future public disclosures we make 

table of contents risks relating to short term debt incurred under residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities and securities repurchase facilities as described above in part ii  item of this annual report on form k under the heading capital resources and liquidity  in the ordinary course of our business  we use short term debt financing obtained through several different types of borrowing facilities to  among other things  fund the acquisition of residential mortgage loans we acquire including those we acquire in anticipation of securitization  fund the origination of commercial real estate loans and other commercial real estate investments  and finance investments in securities and other investments 
we may also use short term borrowings to fund other aspects of our business and operations 
residential loan warehouse facilities 
one source of our short debt debt financing is secured borrowings under residential loan warehouse facilities we have established with two different financial institution counterparties 
under these two warehouse facilities  we have an aggregate borrowing limit of million  however  these facilities are uncommitted  which means that any request we make to borrow funds under these facilities may be declined for any reason  even if at the time of the borrowing request we have then outstanding borrowings that are less than the borrowing limits under these facilities 
short term financing for residential mortgage loans is obtained under these facilities by our legal transfer of mortgage loans to the counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds in an amount less than of the principal amount of the transferred mortgage loans  and our covenant to reacquire those loans from the counterparty for the same amount plus a financing charge 
in order to obtain financing for a residential loan under these facilities  the loan must initially and continuously while the financing remains outstanding meet certain eligibility criteria  including  without limitation  that the loan is not in a delinquent status 
in addition  under these warehouse facilities  residential loans can only be financed for a maximum period  which period would not generally exceed days 
while a residential loan is financed under a warehouse facility  to the extent the market value of the loan declines which market value is generally determined by the counterparty under the facility  we are required to either immediately reacquire the loan or meet a margin requirement to pledge additional collateral  such as cash or additional residential loans  in an amount at least equal to the decline in value 
because our warehouse facilities are uncommitted  at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it  exposing us to  among other things  liquidity risks of the types described above in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and above under the heading market risks 
in addition  with respect to residential loans that at any given time are already being financed through our warehouse facilities  we are exposed to market  credit  liquidity  and other risks of the types described above in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks  if and when those loans become ineligible to be financed  decline in value  or have been financed for the maximum term permitted under the applicable facility 
under our residential loan warehouse facilities  we also make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms including of the type described within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks fair value and liquidity risks that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
in particular  the terms of these facilities include financial covenants  cross default provisions  judgment default provisions  and other events of default such as  for example  events of default triggered by one of the following a change in control over redwood  regulatory enforcement action against redwood  redwood s failure to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes  or redwood s failure to maintain the listing of its common stock on the new york stock exchange 
under a cross default provision  an event of default is triggered and the warehouse facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if an event of default or similar event occurs under another borrowing or credit facility we maintain 
under a judgment default provision  an event of default is triggered and the warehouse facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if a judgment for damages in excess of a specified amount in entered against us in any litigation and we are unable to promptly satisfy the judgment 
financial covenants included in our warehouse facilities 
table of contents include  among others  covenants to maintain i a minimum tangible net worth  ii a maximum ratio of indebtedness to tangible net worth and other limitations on indebtedness  iii a minimum amount of liquid assets  and iv a minimum amount of shareholders equity 
our warehouse facilities could also become unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder could become immediately due and payable if there is a material adverse change in our business 
if we breach or trigger the representations and warranties  covenants  events of default  or other terms of our warehouse facilities  we are exposed to liquidity and other risks  including of the type described above in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition to the two residential loan warehouse facilities described above  in the ordinary course of business we are seeking  and currently expect  to establish additional warehouse facilities that may be of a similar size and may have similar or more restrictive terms 
in the event a counterparty to one or more of our warehouse facilities becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to perform it obligations under the facility  we may be unable to access short term financing we need or fail to recover the full value of our residential mortgage loans financed 
securities repurchase facilities 
another source of our short debt debt financing for us is through securities repurchase facilities we have established with various different financial institution counterparties 
under these facilities  we do not have an aggregate borrowing limit  however  these facilities are uncommitted  which means that any request we make to borrow funds under these facilities may be declined for any reason 
short term financing for securities is obtained under these facilities by our legal transfer of securities to the counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds in an amount less than of the fair value of the transferred securities  and our promise to reacquire those securities from the counterparty for the same amount plus a financing charge 
under these securities repurchase facilities  securities are financed for a fixed period  which would not generally exceed days 
while a security is financed under a securities repurchase facility  to the extent the value of the security declines which value is generally determined by the counterparty under the facility  we are required to either immediately reacquire the security or meet a margin requirement to pledge additional collateral  such as cash or us treasury securities  in an amount at least equal to the decline in value 
at the end of a the fixed period applicable to the financing of a security under a securities repurchase facility  if we intend to continue to obtain financing for that security we would typically request the same counterparty to renew the financing for an additional fixed period 
if the same counterparty does not renew the financing  it may be difficult for us to obtain financing for that security under one of our other securities repurchase facilities  due to the fact that the financial institution counterparties to our securities repurchase facilities generally only provide financing for securities that we purchased from them or one of their affiliates 
because our securities repurchase facilities are uncommitted  at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it  exposing us to  among other things  liquidity risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition  with respect to securities that at any given time are already being financed through our securities repurchase facilities  we are exposed to market  credit  liquidity  and other risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and under the heading market risks  if and when those securities decline in value  or have been financed for the maximum term permitted under the applicable facility 
under our securities repurchase facilities  we also make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms including of the type described within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks fair value and liquidity risks that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
in particular  the terms of these facilities include financial covenants  cross default provisions  judgment default provisions  and other events of default including of the type described within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading residential loan warehouse facilities 

table of contents financial covenants included in our repurchase facilities include  among others  covenants to maintain i a minimum tangible net worth  ii a maximum ratio of indebtedness to shareholders equity  iii a minimum amount of liquid assets  and iv a minimum amount of shareholders equity 
our securities repurchase facilities could also become unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder could become immediately due and payable if there is a material adverse change in our business 
if we breach or trigger the representations and warranties  covenants  events of default  or other terms of our securities repurchase facilities  we are exposed to liquidity and other risks  including of the type described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors and within this part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in the ordinary course of business we may seek to establish additional securities repurchase facilities that may have similar or more restrictive terms 
in the event a counterparty to one or more of our securities repurchase facilities becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to perform it obligations under the facility  we may be unable to access the short term financing we need or fail to recover the full value of our securities financed 

table of contents quantitative information on market risk our future earnings are sensitive to a number of market risk factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
to supplement this discussion on the market risk we face  the following table incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market risks that may affect our consolidated balance sheets at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets at december   was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the forward curve 
our future results depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans this table assumes no credit losses  future interest rates  prepayments  and our ability to invest our existing cash and future cash flow
