item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the discussion of forward looking statements at the beginning of this report 
the following section presents additional information to assess our results of operations and financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data contained elsewhere in this report 
overview macatawa bank corporation is a michigan corporation and a registered bank holding company 
it wholly owns macatawa bank  macatawa statutory trust i and macatawa statutory trust ii 
macatawa bank is a michigan chartered bank with deposit accounts insured by the fdic 
the bank operates twenty six branch offices and a lending and operational service facility  providing a full range of commercial and consumer banking and trust services in kent county  ottawa county  and northern allegan county  michigan 
macatawa statutory trusts i and ii are grantor trusts and issued million each of pooled trust preferred securities 
these trusts are not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements 
for further information regarding consolidation  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had total assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
we recognized net income of million in  a substantial improvement over the prior two years  and we experienced our seventh consecutive quarter of net income to end in response to our losses during  and the first quarter of  our board of directors implemented additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles  including more conservative lending principles 
the focus of our management team turned from growth in our business to executing these disciplined business and banking procedures and policies designed to limit future losses  preserve capital and improve operational efficiencies 
in addition  the board of directors added experienced members to provide further oversight and guidance 
these and other efforts were reflected in our results of operations for and with lower levels of charge offs and provision for loan losses  reductions in operating expenses and reduction in balance sheet totals resulting in improvement in our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios 
we successfully completed our shareholder rights offering and public offering of common stock in june resulting in net proceeds of million and contributed million of the proceeds from the stock offering to the bank retaining the remaining million at the holding company 
as of december   the company s and the bank s regulatory capital ratios were the highest they have been since december  also within the past two years  much progress has been made at reducing our non performing assets 
the following table reflects period end balances of these non performing assets as well as total loan delinquencies 
dollars in thousands december  december  december  non performing loans other repossessed assets other real estate owned total non performing assets total loan delinquencies days or greater past due earnings have been severely impacted by high costs associated with administration and disposition of non performing assets 
these costs  including losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties  were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
going forward  as further reductions in non performing assets are accomplished  we expect the costs associated with these assets to also decline thereby allowing for improved earnings in future periods 
our earnings in were favorably impacted by negative provision for loan losses of million 
as discussed in detail later in this section  this was a result of the decline in our historical charge off levels from prior years 
we do not expect a similar level of negative provision for loan losses in 
table of contents the following table reflects the provision for loan losses for the past two years along with certain metrics that impact the determination of the level of the provision for loan losses 
dollars in thousands for the year ended december provision for loan losses net charge offs net charge offs to average loans nonperforming loans to total loans loans transferred to ore to average loans tdrs to average loans under the direction of our board  we have worked closely with our regulators at the frb  the fdic and the ofir to put in place improved controls and procedures 
on february   the bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and ofir  its primary banking regulators 
as a result of the improvement in our financial condition and results of operations  our implementation of additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles  and our compliance with the consent order  upon completion of the bank s joint examination by the fdic and ofir  the fdic and ofir terminated the consent order effective march  in connection with the termination of the consent order  the bank reached an understanding with the regulators in the form of the mou 
additional information about the termination of the consent order and the mou may be found in item of this report under the heading regulatory developments 
this information is here incorporated by reference 
the company entered into a written agreement with the frb effective july  as of december   we believe that we were in full compliance with all aspects of the written agreement 
the state of michigan entered into the recession a couple of years before the rest of the country did and has experienced heavy job loss as a result of the concentration the state had related to the automotive industry 
our market areas of grand rapids and holland fared better than the state as a whole  but nevertheless the impact of our local economy on our results has been profound 
the recession and job loss impacted housing values  commercial real estate values and consumer activity 
improvement has been evident during  with the state of michigan being identified in a bloomberg economic evaluation of states as having the second fastest pace of recovery in the us  second only to north dakota 
the state s unemployment rate at the end of was  no longer the highest in the country  and was down dramatically from in june the holland area unemployment was and the grand rapids area unemployment was at the end of residential housing values and commercial real estate property values decreased significantly over the past few years  but have shown recent signs of stabilization  with newer appraisals reflecting values at or above prior year values 
it also appears that the housing market in our primary market area is beginning to show signs of stabilization 
based on us census data  housing building permits in the grand rapids wyoming metropolitan area were up approximately in compared to in the holland grand haven metropolitan area  housing building permits were up approximately in compared to over the past two years  we have reduced our balance of loans outstanding  diversified our commercial loan portfolio  reduced concentrations to residential real estate developers and increased our consumer loan portfolio and residential mortgage activity as a percentage of overall production 
this has included adding experienced residential mortgage lenders and pulling back on commercial loan production in some cases 
our loans to residential developers have decreased from million at december  to million at december  in addition  overall commercial real estate loans have decreased from million at december  to million at december  consumer loans have decreased at a slower pace  totaling million at december   compared to million at december  
table of contents results of operations summary net income available to common shares was million or income per common share for compared to a net loss of million or loss per common share for the results for were significantly impacted by a negative provision for loan losses of million as a result of a significantly lower level of net charge offs experienced over the past two years  along with a reduction in the overall level of nonperforming loans in this compares to provision for loan losses of million in the results for included the following a million gain on the sale of our investment securities portfolio in the second quarter and a  gain recognized on the sale of property in the fourth quarter that had been held for future expansion 
these items are discussed more fully below 
the overall improvement in financial results for compared to relate primarily to the performance of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was a negative million for compared to million for net charge offs of loans were down sharply in at million compared to million in costs associated with nonperforming assets were million in  compared to million for lost interest from non performing assets decreased to approximately million for compared to million for each of these items is discussed more fully below 
net interest income net interest income totaled million during compared to million during the decrease in net interest income during compared to was due primarily to a million decrease in average earning assets as a result of our focus on reducing credit exposure within certain segments of our loan portfolio and liquidity improvement 
our net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets ie net interest margin or margin held steady in  increasing by basis point compared to as is customary in the banking industry  interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted in the computation of the yield on tax exempt securities and net interest margin using a tax rate to report these items on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
average interest earning assets decreased from billion to billion throughout the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for from for the decline was from decreases in the yield on our residential and consumer loan portfolios  which have repriced in the generally lower rate environment during our margin has been constrained by our decision to hold significant balances in liquid and short term investments in the past two years 
going forward  as we deploy these balances into higher yielding assets within the investment securities and loan portfolios  we expect our net interest margin to be positively impacted 
while yield on earning assets decreased  our net interest margin for remained stable due to an offsetting basis point decrease in our cost of funds from for to for average interest bearing liabilities decreased from billion in to billion in a decrease in the rates paid on our deposit accounts in response to declining market rates and the rollover of time deposits and other borrowings at lower rates within the current rate environment caused the reduction in our cost of funds 
we had a sharp increase in institutional deposits late in and these balances were maintained throughout while maintaining a strong liquidity position for the bank  these excess short term deposits had the impact of decreasing net interest margin 
margin continues to be dampened by the impact of our elevated levels of nonperforming assets  including other real estate owned and nonaccrual loans 
however  as we continue to reduce these levels  our margin will benefit 
the estimated negative impact of these nonperforming assets on net interest margin decreased from basis points in to basis points in the continued decline in the level of average earning assets may have a further negative impact on net interest income in  however  we expect the balances to stabilize in a continued decline in the cost of funds  primarily from the repricing of term funding at lower costs  is expected to partially offset the impact of lower earning asset levels in

the provision for loan losses was higher in and early in as we responded to rapid declines in real estate values due to weakness in the economy 
our response required higher levels of charge offs in and which also led to a higher provision for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in and million in  compared to million in the lower level of charge offs was a result of a slowing in the rate of declines in real estate values and success at reducing our levels of non performing loans 
as discussed in previous reports  in response to our elevated loan losses in and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors increased the governance over the lending function and  working directly with the management team  took steps to reduce our exposure within certain credit concentrations  establish more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards and implement new lending and compliance procedures and policies and new problem loan identification and resolution plans 
these steps have had a profound impact on our credit performance and loss mitigation in the ultimate amount of the loan loss provision in all periods is a byproduct of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed to be adequate under our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
more information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level may be found in this item of the report under the heading allowance for loan losses below and in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in compared to million in noninterest income for was impacted by a couple of nonrecurring items  including million in gains on the sale of our investment securities portfolio and a  gain on the sale of a property we were holding for future expansion 
revenue from deposit services decreased  to million in compared to million in the decline in was related primarily to decreases in non sufficient fund fees  consistent with a decline experienced across the entire banking industry resulting from regulatory changes regarding fees and improved account administration practices by customers 
net gains on mortgage loans included gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
we sell the majority of the fixed rate mortgage loans we originate 
we do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell 
this income was up significantly during as a result of our renewed focus on residential mortgage volume and the addition of experienced mortgage professionals in late and in the first half of this activity was also impacted positively by the low interest rate environment that existed throughout 
table of contents a summary of net gains on mortgage loans and related volume was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december net gains on sales of loans real estate mortgage loans originated for sale real estate mortgage loans sold net gain on the sale of real estate mortgage loans as a percent of real estate mortgage loans sold loan sales margin as mortgage rates remain low at the end of  we anticipate continued elevated levels of mortgage banking income in the first part of loan sales margin improved during as we refined our product pricing during the year 
trust service revenue declined  to million in from million in our financial performance in previous years and the existence of the consent order likely have impacted how we are perceived in the marketplace  resulting in challenges to retain trust customers and maintain levels of trust revenue 
we believe that our improved financial performance in and the termination of the consent order could have a positive impact on our future trust service revenue 
atm and debit card processing income increased  in to million compared to million in the increase reflected a continued increase in usage from current customers and overall growth in the number of debit and atm card customers 
promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continued to be successful 
recent regulatory changes implementing price controls over what financial institutions can charge for these services may impact the level of such income we recognize in the future 
we did not sell any investment securities during  and therefore had no gain on sale of securities during the year 
during the second quarter of  the sale of our securities portfolio resulted in a gain of million 
we completed the disposition of nearly all of the municipal  corporate and us agency securities in our available for sale investment portfolio through sales in the open market 
these securities were comprised of approximately million in municipal securities with an average yield of and an average life of years  million in corporate securities with an average yield of and an average life of years  and million in us agency securities with an average yield of and an average life of years 
the sales were executed as part of our overall strategy to increase our regulatory capital ratios 
the majority of the proceeds were initially invested in liquid money market balances with money center banks 
during  we began reinvesting these proceeds in higher yielding investment securities as market conditions and liquidity allowed 
other income was million in compared to million in earnings from bank owned life insurance increased  from as the underlying investments performed better in than in ore rental income increased to  in from  in much of this increase came from a property that was sold late in other income for included a gain on the sale of a property that was held for future branch expansion which was sold in the fourth quarter of for a gain  noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million in  compared to million in the steady decline in our other expense areas reflects our active management of controllable costs to offset the increases in nonperforming asset costs 
costs associated with nonperforming assets continue to remain elevated  increasing  in to million compared to million in these costs included legal costs  repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties 
repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense included survey and appraisal  property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs 
losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties included both net losses on the sale of properties and unrealized losses from value declines for outstanding properties 

table of contents costs associated with nonperforming assets are itemized in the following table in thousands legal and professional repossessed and foreclosed property administration losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties total in response to the elevated problem asset levels  the related costs to administer these assets and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  the board of directors and management took tangible steps to reduce problem asset levels 
these steps are discussed further in this item under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality below 
because of these additional steps and as problems loans move through the collection process  the costs associated with nonperforming assets have remained elevated  yet stabilized during as we reduce our balances of other real estate owned  we expect these costs to decline 
salaries and benefit expense increased  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to our hiring of experienced real estate professionals to facilitate sales of other real estate owned and mortgage origination professionals to increase focus on our consumer portfolios to diversify credit risk 
the impact of these increased costs was mitigated by our continued focus on operational efficiencies  continued curtailment of bonuses and wage increases in response to economic conditions and managed attrition 
we have continued to scale down our operations with the shrinkage in size of the bank and focus on a disciplined approach to our business 
salaries and benefit expense are expected to decrease in due to continued managed attrition 
legal and professional fees decreased significantly in  from million in to  in these expenses were unusually high in as a result of legal fees associated with consultation related to the consent order  the material weakness reported in our form k and our implementation of additional corporate governance procedures  including more consultation with corporate legal counsel 
also  legal fees during included increased costs associated with an sec investigation 
by letter dated may   the commission advised us that the investigation had been completed and that no enforcement action had been recommended to the commission 
we anticipate continued reductions in legal and professional expenses in fdic assessments decreased to million in compared to million in as a result of our reduced level of deposits and changes to the assessment base implemented by the fdic 
while these costs have decreased compared to  they are elevated due to our assessment category 
we expect our fdic assessments for to decrease due to a smaller assessment base and due to the termination of our consent order 
we estimate an annual cost savings of million  based on december  asset levels 
because the consent order was not terminated until march   we expect to recognize less than all of these estimated annual cost savings during further discussion regarding the determination of fdic assessments for the bank may be found in item of this report under the heading supervision and regulation 
insurance costs for bond and directors and officers d o insurance decreased significantly from million in to million in our costs continued to be significantly higher than historically normal levels as a result of a higher rate per dollar of coverage charged due to the perceived increased risk by our insurance carriers from our coming under the consent order in the reductions experienced in were a result of our financial condition improvements demonstrated to the insurance carriers and the resulting reduction in premiums charged 
we expect further reductions in these costs in with the termination of the consent order and as we continue to improve our financial performance 
occupancy expense declined  in following a decrease of  in furniture and equipment expense was down  in after a decrease of  in marketing expenses decreased slightly in and data processing expenses increased slightly in other expense was down  in the declines in within these expense areas were the direct result of our continued initiatives to reduce controllable costs 
in addition to eliminating or outsourcing certain backroom functions  these initiatives included restructuring third party contracts  acceleration of electronic delivery for certain customers and trimming controllable costs 
when excluding fdic assessments and problem asset costs  non interest expense would have been approximately million for  down million from million for we expect efficiency to continue to improve in as a result of our continued expense reduction initiatives 

table of contents federal income tax expense benefit we recorded no federal income tax expense or benefit in and recorded federal income tax expense of million in we recorded income tax expense of million for primarily related to a reclassification from other comprehensive income for gains recognized in earnings associated with the sale of our investment securities 
a valuation allowance has been maintained on our deferred tax assets each reporting period since the realization of deferred tax assets net of a recorded valuation allowance is largely dependent upon future taxable income  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to carry back losses to available tax years 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including taxable income in carry back years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
at december   our tax valuation allowance totaled million 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized or the valuation allowance is no longer required 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is largely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
we returned to profitability in each of the last three quarters of and each quarter of as we continue to generate consistent profitability  the need to maintain the valuation allowance diminishes 
we perform an analysis each quarter as to the need to maintain the valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of  a tax law change extended the carry back of and net operating losses to five years from the previous two year carry back period 
as a result we recorded an million favorable tax benefit that reduced our net operating loss for this carry back extension was only available to financial institutions like us that did not receive capital under the us treasury s troubled asset relief program tarp 
this change allowed us to carry back and recover the full tax benefit of our net operating loss 
we received million in income tax refunds during as a result of this tax law change 
financial condition summary due to the consent order and the continuing soft economic conditions  we have been focused on reducing our loan portfolio  reducing exposure in higher loan concentration types and improving our financial condition through increased liquidity  diversification of credit risk  improved capital ratios and reduced reliance on non core funding 
we have experienced positive results in each of these areas over the past seven quarters 
total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease in total assets was largely from a decline of million in our loan portfolio due to efforts to reduce concentration in certain loan types and improve on balance sheet liquidity 
the reduction in assets since december  allowed us to reduce wholesale funding  including out of market deposits from brokers by million 
all of our remaining brokered deposits matured and were paid off during total deposits were billion at december   down million  from billion at december  in addition to the decline in brokered deposits  local jumbo time deposits were down million 
total shareholders equity increased by million primarily from the successful completion of our shareholder rights offering and public offering of common stock which were completed in june  resulting in net proceeds of million 
in addition  net income of million contributed to the increase in total shareholders equity 
we contributed million of the proceeds from the stock offering to the bank and retained the remaining million at the holding company 
this allowed the bank s regulatory capital ratios to grow to levels exceeding those required by the consent order and to levels ordinarily considered to be well capitalized 
as discussed earlier in this report in item under regulatory developments  the consent order has been terminated 
as of december   the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized as a result of being subject to the consent order 
however  had the consent order been terminated as of december   the bank would have been categorized as well capitalized 
we expect the bank to be categorized as well capitalized as of march  cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents  which include federal funds sold and short term investments  were million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was primarily the result of excess liquidity caused by loan shrinkage exceeding our ability to redeploy proceeds into other earning assets 
these balances are also elevated due to high short term balances maintained by our large deposit customers 
we expect our balances of short term investments to remain high until loan demand materially increases and more attractive investment opportunities emerge 
securities securities increased million to million at december  from million at december  we began rebuilding our investment portfolio during the second quarter of the balance at december  primarily consisted of us agency securities and various municipal investments 
the balance at december  primarily consisted of us treasury securities held for collateral purposes 
we expect to continue to reinvest excess liquidity and selectively rebuild our investment portfolio to continue our diversification of asset quality throughout 
table of contents loan portfolio and asset quality in response to the losses we have incurred and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors has increased governance over the lending function and has taken tangible steps to reduce our loan portfolio  including our exposure within certain credit concentrations 
more discussion regarding these steps may be found in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our total loan portfolio decreased million to billion at december  from billion at december  during  our commercial and industrial loans decreased million  commercial real estate loans declined million and consumer loans decreased million 
a breakdown of the composition of the loan portfolio is shown in the table below in thousands december  percent of total loans december  percent of total loans commercial real estate residential developed unsecured to residential developers vacant and unimproved commercial development residential improved commercial improved manufacturing and industrial total commercial real estate loans commercial and industrial total commercial loans consumer residential mortgage unsecured home equity other secured   total consumer total loans includes both owner occupied and non owner occupied commercial real estate 
our consumer residential mortgage loan portfolio  which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners  comprised approximately of portfolio loans at the end of  up from of portfolio loans at the end of as we execute our strategy to diversify our credit risk from commercial real estate 
a large portion of our residential mortgage loan origination volume of these types of loans continues to be sold on the secondary market with servicing released 
as a result of our holding more of our residential mortgage production in portfolio which increased million in  we saw a decrease in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated for sale during compared to residential mortgage loans originated for sale were million in compared to million in we have not yet had to repurchase any loans sold  however  due to market conditions many banks are being required to repurchase loans due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the investor s purchase criteria 
during  we expect to continue to retain in our loan portfolio certain types of residential mortgage loans primarily high quality  low loan to value loans in an effort to stabilize the recent decreases we have experienced in the loan portfolio and diversify our credit risk 
our portfolio of other consumer loans includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans 
these types of loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  and comprised approximately of our portfolio loans at the end of and at the end of the decline in the commercial loan portfolio during and reflected the continuing soft economic conditions in west michigan and efforts to reduce our exposure within certain credit concentrations 
we focused our efforts throughout and on reducing our exposure to residential land development loans which were the source of most of our loan losses since  thereby diversifying our commercial loan portfolio and improving asset quality 
we expect continued shrinkage  though at a slower pace  in our real estate development portfolios as we continue to diversify our credit exposure 

table of contents total commercial loans  consisting of commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans  were million at december  and million at december  this portfolio remains our largest loan segment and accounted for approximately of the total loan portfolio at december  and at december  our commercial loan portfolio is made up of loans to small and mid sized business 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased by million to million at december  and represented of our commercial portfolio 
the decrease was primarily from a general decline in business activity resulting from the soft economy 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio declined by million due to substantial efforts to reduce problem loans and overall exposure in this segment 
commercial real estate accounted for approximately of the commercial loan portfolio at december  and consisted primarily of loans to business owners and developers of owner and non owner occupied commercial properties and loans to developers of single and multi family residential properties 
in the table above  we show our commercial real estate portfolio by loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  and by stage of development 
improved loans are generally secured by properties that are under construction or completed and placed in use 
development loans are secured by properties that are in the process of development or fully developed 
vacant land loans are secured by raw land for which development has not yet begun and agricultural loans 
total commercial real estate loans declined million since december  as we continued to focus on reducing our real estate loan concentrations and balances 
commercial loans related to residential real estate  the portfolio that has created the majority of stress within our loan portfolio  declined million 
the balance of commercial loans secured by nonresidential real estate declined million since december  we expect continued reductions  though at a slower pace in  in our commercial real estate loan portfolio

an administrative loan committee consisting of senior management and seasoned lending and collections personnel meets monthly to manage our internal watch list and proactively manage high risk loans 
when reasonable doubt exists concerning collectability of interest or principal of one of our loans  that loan is placed in non accrual status 
any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 

table of contents nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  foreclosed assets and repossessed assets 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled million compared to million at december  the relative level of new loans moving to a nonperforming status has significantly declined as our efforts to proactively address credit risks have taken hold 
during  we completed an independent re evaluation of our commercial loan portfolio 
significant progress was made to accelerate workout strategies with problem assets  leading to several properties moving to other real estate owned  which increased by million since december  based on the amount of loans currently in their redemption period million at december   we expect reduced levels of loans moving into other real estate owned in proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were million in resulting in a net gain of million 
this is an increase from the volume of sales in  when we experienced proceeds of million and realized a net loss of nonperforming loans include loans on non accrual status and loans delinquent more than days but still accruing 
as of december   nonperforming loans totaled million  or of total portfolio loans  compared to million  or of total portfolio loans  at december  loans for development or sale of family residential properties comprised a large portion of non performing loans 
they were approximately million  or of total non performing loans  at december  compared to million  or of total non performing loans  at december  the remaining balance of non performing loans at december  consisted of million of commercial real estate loans secured by various types of non residential property  million of commercial and industrial loans  and million of consumer and residential mortgage loans 
foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december  compared to million at december  of this balance  there were commercial real estate loan properties totaling approximately million 
the remaining balance was comprised of residential properties totaling approximately million 
all properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less estimated costs to sell and then evaluated monthly for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach 
updated property valuations are obtained at least annually on all foreclosed assets to ensure proper carrying values are maintained 
at december   our foreclosed asset portfolio had a weighted average age held in portfolio of days

table of contents allowance for loan losses determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective 
as loan losses escalated over and and then began to slow in and stabilize in  we re evaluated and refined our approach to determining the allowance for loan losses 
timely identification of risk rating changes within the commercial loan portfolio is key to our process of establishing an appropriate allowance balance 
the internal risk rating system is discussed below 
in early  our loan review function began reporting functionally to the audit committee 
the risk management department is now administratively responsible for the loan review function 
under this framework  all commercial loan risk ratings are independently evaluated by our internal loan review function upon origination or renewal 
in addition  the majority of our commercial loans are independently reviewed by our internal loan review function at least annually to monitor the accuracy and completeness of the watch list and all risk ratings 
also  we complete our analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis versus the quarterly approach used prior to these actions were intended to further strengthen our process for establishing  in a timely fashion  the amount of the allowance for loan losses that management believes to be appropriate in light of changes in the condition of our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  a decrease of million  compared to million at december  the balance of the allowance for loan losses represented of total portfolio loans at december  compared to of total portfolio loans at december  while this ratio decreased  the allowance to nonperforming loan coverage ratio increased significantly from at december  to at december the following is a summary of our portfolio loan balances and changes in the allowance for loan losses and related ratios 
dollars in thousands december portfolio loans average daily balance of loans for the year amount of loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year addition to allowance charged to operations loans charged off real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial and industrial total commercial residential mortgage consumer recoveries real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial and industrial total commercial residential mortgage consumer net charge offs balance at end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at year end allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at year end 
table of contents the continued reduction in net charge offs over the past several quarters had a significant effect on the historical loss component of our allowance for loan loss computation as did the improvements in our credit quality metrics 
the table below shows the changes in these metrics over the past five quarters in millions quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  quarter ended december  commercial loans nonperforming loans other real estate owned and repo assets total nonperforming assets net charge offs total delinquencies nonperforming loans have continually declined since the first quarter of to million at december   which was our lowest level of nonperforming loans since the second quarter of the first three quarters of reflected reduced charge offs from the linked quarter 
while net charge offs during the fourth quarter increased  they were still below the level in the first quarter of and prior year quarters 
perhaps even more importantly  our total delinquencies have continued to decline  from million at march  to just million at december  as discussed earlier  the sustained reduced level of quarterly net charge offs has had a significant effect on our month quarter historical loss ratios  which are the base for our allowance for loan loss computation 
the change in the month historical loss ratios from december  to december  reduced the historical loss allocations in our allowance computation by million 
these factors all provide for a reduction in our provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased million to a negative million for compared to million for net charge offs were million for compared to million for  a reduction of million 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was for compared to for we are encouraged by the reduced level of charge offs over the past two years 
we do  however  recognize that future charge offs and resulting provisions for loan losses are expected to be impacted by the timing and extent of changes in the overall economy and the real estate markets 
we believe we have seen some stabilization in the pace of decline in economic conditions and real estate markets 
however  we expect it to take additional time for sustained improvement in the economy and real estate markets in order for us to reduce our non performing and impaired loans to acceptable levels 
our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed appropriate based upon our monthly assessment of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of allowance and related provision for loan losses relies on several key elements  which include specific allowances for loans considered impaired  general allowance for commercial loans not considered impaired based upon applying our loan rating system  and general allocations based on historical trends for homogeneous loan groups with similar risk characteristics 
overall  impaired loans decreased to million at december   from million at december  included in impaired loans at december  were million of performing loans that renewed at their existing contractual rates 
under new accounting guidance applicable beginning with the third quarter of asu  because these loans were graded substandard and the contractual rates were less than market rates for similar loans  these loan renewals are considered troubled debt restructurings  and thus are impaired at december  the specific allowance for overall impaired loans increased million to million  or of total impaired loans  at december  compared to million  or of total impaired loans  at december  the decrease in impaired loans was primarily attributable to migration to other real estate owned  loan payoffs and upgrades more than offsetting new loans moving into an impaired status 
as previously discussed under the heading portfolio loans and asset quality  this decline was consistent with a relative decline in the level of loans moving to a nonperforming status 
charge offs totaling million had previously been taken on these impaired loans  bringing the balance to million as of december  combined with the million of specific reserves at december   these loans have been written down 
specific allowances are established on individually impaired credits where we believe it is probable that a loss may be incurred 
specific allowances are determined based on discounting estimated cash flows over the life of the loan or based on the fair value of collateral supporting the loan 
for commercial real estate  generally appraisals are used to estimate the fair value and determine the appropriate specific allowance 
estimated selling costs are also considered in the estimate 
when it becomes apparent that liquidation of the collateral is the only source of repayment  the collateral shortfall is charged off rather than carried as a specific allowance 

table of contents the general allowance allocated to commercial loans that were not considered to be impaired was based upon the internal risk grade of such loans 
we use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system 
loans are stratified between real estate secured and non real estate secured 
the real estate secured portfolio is further stratified by the type of real estate 
each stratified portfolio is assigned a loss allocation factor 
a lower grade assigned to a loan category generally results in a greater allocation percentage 
changes in risk grade of loans affect the amount of the allowance allocation 
the determination of our loss factors is based upon our actual loss history by loan grade and adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date 
we use a rolling month quarter actual net charge off history as the base for our computation for commercial loans 
the month period ended december  reflected a sizeable decrease in net charge off experience 
we addressed this volatility in the qualitative factor considerations applied in our allowance computation 
adjustments to the qualitative factors also involved consideration of different loss periods for the bank  including and month periods 
considering the change in our qualitative factors and the decrease in our commercial loan portfolio balances  the general commercial loan allowance decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this resulted in a general reserve percentage allocated at december  of of commercial loans  a decrease from at december  the qualitative component of our allowance allocated to commercial loans was million at december  down from million at december  to maintain the allowance balances despite the reduction in the historical loss rate 
groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate and open and closed end consumer loans  receive allowance allocations based on loan type 
a rolling month quarter historical loss experience period was applied to residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios 
as with commercial loans that are not considered impaired  the determination of the allowance allocation percentage is based principally on our historical loss experience 
these allocations are adjusted for consideration of general economic and business conditions  credit quality and delinquency trends  collateral values  and recent loss experience for these similar pools of loans 
the homogeneous loan allowance was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was related to significant improvements in delinquencies in both residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios 
the formula allowance allocated to commercial loans that are not considered to be impaired is calculated by applying historical loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk rating of such loans 
we use a loan rating method based upon an eight point system 
loans rated a or better are considered of acceptable risk 
loans rated a exhibit above normal risk to the company and warrant a greater level of attention by management 
these loans are subject to on going review and assessment by our administrative loan committee 
loans rated a or worse are considered substandard  doubtful or loss  exhibit a greater relative risk of loss to the company based upon the rating and warrant an active workout plan administered by our special asset group  as discussed above 
loans are assigned a loss allocation factor for each loan class based principally on the loss history for each risk rating within each loan category 
commercial real estate loans are stratified and grouped by the type of real estate securing such loans for determining the loan classification category 
for and the first three quarters of the loss history was based upon the latest month period  as this was considered most representative within the then current economic cycle 
however  given the significant improvement in our charge off history over the month periods in late  we determined that an month quarter historical period was more appropriate for the fourth quarter as heavy charge off months would have rolled off the month period  and would have resulted in a substantially smaller overall allowance balance 
until overall levels of nonperforming loans decline over a sustained period  we believe such a reduction in the allowance balance would be premature 
the historical loss allocation factor used is adjusted for consideration of significant qualitative factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the analysis date 
the worse the risk rating assigned to a loan category  the greater the loss allocation factor that is applied 
the qualitative factors assessed and used to adjust historical loss experience reflect our best assessment of the impact of economic trends  delinquency and other problem loan trends  trends in valuations supporting underlying collateral  changes in loan portfolio concentrations and changes in internal credit administration practices have on probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
qualitative adjustments are inherently subjective and there can be no assurance that these adjustments have properly identified probable losses in our loan portfolio 
more information regarding the subjectivity involved in determining the estimate of the allowance for loan losses may be found in this item of the report under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type at the dates indicated 
december dollars in thousands allowance amount of each category to total loans allowance amount of each category to total loans commercial and commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer total the components of the allowance for loan losses were as follows december dollars in thousands balance of loans allowance amount balance of loans allowance amount commercial and commercial real estate impaired with allowance recorded impaired with no allowance recorded loss allocation factor on non impaired loans residential mortgage and consumer reserves on residential mortgage troubled debt restructurings loss allocation factor total with the exception of certain tdrs  impaired commercial loans at december  were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system 
the million of residential mortgage troubled debt restructurings were associated with programs approved by the us government during to minimize the number of consumer foreclosures 
these loans involved the restructuring of terms on consumer mortgages to allow customers to mitigate foreclosure by meeting a lower loan payment requirement based upon their current cash flow 
we have been active at utilizing these programs and working with our customers to reduce the risk of foreclosure 
additional information regarding impaired loans at december  and may be found in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note the decrease in the level of the allowance for was due to decreases in net charge offs from commercial loans  shrinkage in the overall loan portfolio during  a reduction in the level of impaired loans and nonperforming loans  and improvement in the loan grades  which provides a lower allocation 
our weighted average loan grade improved from at december  to at december  the decrease of million in reserves on commercial loans was due to a million decrease in the loss allocation factor allowance on non impaired loans  partially offset by a  increase in specific reserves on impaired loans 
the decrease in the loss experience incurred during this period and a general improvement in the credit quality and the overall risk ratings of commercial loans is the primary reason for this decrease 
the general allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease was largely related to improvements in delinquency for residential mortgages and home equity loans at december  compared to december  of the million allowance at december   related to specific allocations on impaired loans  related to the formula allowance on commercial loans and related to general allocations for homogeneous loans 
of the million allowance at december   related to specific allocations on impaired loans  related to formula allowance on commercial loans and related to general allocations for homogeneous loans 

table of contents of the million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at december   million is from general environmental allocations with million driven from historical experience 
of the million total formula based allowance for loan loss allocations at december   million is from general environmental allocations with million driven from historical experience 
the above allocations are not intended to imply limitations on usage of the allowance 
the entire allowance is available for any loan losses without regard to loan type 
more information regarding steps to address the elevated levels of substandard  impaired and nonperforming loans  which have largely resulted in the need to increase the allowance for loan losses  may be found in this item of the report under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality above and in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note although we believe our allowance for loan losses has captured the losses that are probable in our portfolio as of december   there can be no assurance that all losses have been identified or that the allowance is sufficient 
the additional efforts by management to accelerate the identification and disposition of problem assets discussed above  and the impact of the lasting economic slowdown may result in additional losses in premises and equipment premises and equipment totaled million at december   representing a decrease of million from million at december  the decline was largely from depreciation of current facilities in excess of capital additions during when economic conditions and financial performance improve  we will assess the prospects for future branch expansion 
deposits total deposits decreased million to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  because of the decline in assets during  we decreased many of our higher costing deposits 
the decline in deposits was primarily from a million decrease in out of market deposits generated from brokers and a million decrease in local jumbo time deposits 
the bank had no brokered deposits as of december  the overall declines in deposit categories noted above were partially offset by growth in balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts 
non interest checking account balances increased million during these increases are particularly noteworthy considering the limited economic expansion in western michigan 
we believe our growth in balances of personal and business checking and savings accounts was primarily attributable to our focus on quality customer service  the desire of customers to deal with a local bank  the convenience of our maturing branch network and the breadth and depth of our sophisticated product line 
noninterest bearing demand accounts comprised of total deposits at december  compared to of total deposits at december  part of the reason for the increase in noninterest bearing demand accounts was associated with temporary insurance programs provided for these account types by the u 
s government 
because of the generally low rates paid on interest bearing account alternatives  many of our business customers chose to keep their balances in these more liquid and insured account types 
interest bearing demand  including money market and savings accounts  comprised of total deposits at december  compared to at the end of time accounts as a percentage of total deposits were at december  compared to at december  additional information about the restrictions on the bank s deposit gathering activities may be found in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note and is here incorporated by reference 
borrowed funds borrowed funds consist of advances from the federal home loan bank  long term debt associated with the issuance of trust preferred securities  subordinated debt  and federal funds purchased provided by our correspondent banks

borrowed funds totaled million at december   including million of federal home loan bank advances  million in long term debt associated with trust preferred securities and million in subordinated debt 
as discussed in item of this report in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the third quarter of we modified the terms of six of our fhlb advances  resulting in the lengthening of the maturity from years to years and reducing the weighted average rate on those advances from to 
this transaction was executed to provide an interest rate maturity distribution to match with our strategy of holding more long term fixed rate residential mortgages in our loan portfolio 

table of contents we have exercised our right to defer interest payments on our trust preferred securities for consecutive quarters or until such earlier time as is determined by further action of the board of directors 
during the deferral period  we may not declare or pay any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock or make any payment on any outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the trust preferred securities 
through december   we have deferred interest payments for nine quarters 
we continue to accrue interest during the deferral period and at december  total interest accrued for trust preferred securities was million  compared to million at december  borrowed funds decreased during as we were able to payoff maturing borrowings with excess liquidity derived from shrinkage in assets on our balance sheet 
capital resources holding company total shareholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was primarily a result of the successful completion of our shareholder rights offering and public offering of common stock which were completed in june the offerings resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock and net proceeds of million 
the conversion of our subordinated note due resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock  adding million to shareholders equity 
also positively impacting total shareholders equity was the million of net income earned during our regulatory capital ratios improved throughout and ended the year at their highest levels since december  the following table shows our regulatory capital ratios on a consolidated basis for the past several quarters

as disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the bank has an understanding with its regulators that it will not declare or pay any dividend without their prior written consent 
as the payment of future cash dividends by macatawa bank corporation is largely dependent upon dividends received from the bank out of its earnings  we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the near term 
during the period that we do not declare and pay cash dividends on our preferred stock  we may not declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
we expect to reassess our ability to resume the payment of dividends on our preferred and common stock if and when current levels of cash  earnings and capital are at acceptable levels and the prospects are positive for sustained economic growth and improved performance 
additional information on restrictions on payments of dividends by us may be found in item of this report under the headings regulatory developments and supervision and regulation  and in item of this report in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  and is here incorporated by reference

macatawa bank the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized at december  the bank s regulatory capital ratios exceeded the levels ordinarily required to be categorized as well capitalized at december  however  because the bank was subject to the consent order at december   the bank could not be categorized as well capitalized regardless of its actual capital levels 
under the consent order  the bank was required to have and maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least

we expect the bank to be categorized as well capitalized as of march  in connection with the termination of the consent order  the bank reached an understanding with the regulators to maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least  which the bank exceeded at december  liquidity liquidity of macatawa bank the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to manage a variety of sources and uses of funds 
our consolidated statements of cash flows categorize these sources and uses into operating  investing and financing activities 
we primarily focus on developing access to a variety of borrowing sources to supplement our deposit gathering activities and provide funds for growing our investment and loan portfolios 
our sources of liquidity include our borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of chicago s discount window  the federal home loan bank  federal funds purchased lines and other secured borrowing sources with our correspondent banks  loan payments by our borrowers  maturity and sales of our securities available for sale  growth of our deposits and deposit equivalents  federal funds sold  and the various capital resources discussed above 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of our customers 
our customers may be either borrowers with credit needs or depositors wanting to withdraw funds 
our liquidity management involves periodic monitoring of our assets considered to be liquid and illiquid  and our funding sources considered to be core and non core and short term less than months and long term 
we have established parameters that monitor  among other items  our level of liquid assets to short term liabilities  our level of non core funding reliance and our level of available borrowing capacity 
we have also developed a contingency funding plan to stress test our liquidity requirements arising from certain events that may trigger liquidity shortages  such as rapid loan growth in excess of normal growth levels or the loss of deposits and other funding sources under extreme circumstances 
prior to  our balance sheet size was led by loan growth 
during that time  the bank utilized brokered deposits and other wholesale funding sources to augment its local deposits within its liquidity and interest rate risk tolerances 
limits have always been placed on brokered deposit and wholesale funding exposure and monitored monthly by the alco committee 
we maintained a diversified wholesale funding structure and actively manage our maturing wholesale sources to reduce the risk to liquidity shortages 
in response to the volatile conditions in the national markets since  we have actively pursued initiatives to further strengthen our liquidity position 
the bank has made significant progress to intentionally reduce its reliance on non core funding sources  including brokered deposits  and is focused on achieving a non core funding dependency ratio of below its peer group average 
during  we paid off million in brokered deposits and had no such deposits outstanding at december  since december   we have reduced our brokered deposits by million 
we also reduced other borrowed funds by million in  thereby shrinking non core funding by a total of million during we sold our investment security portfolio in the second quarter of and reinvested the proceeds into short term investments 
we continued to maintain a large portion of these proceeds in liquid investments throughout the bank held million of liquid money market investments at december  
table of contents in addition to strategies focused on improving the liquidity of the balance sheet  the bank s borrowing capacity from correspondent banks has been improved and was approximately million as of december in the normal course of business  we enter into certain contractual obligations including obligations which are considered in our overall liquidity management 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  dollars in thousands less than year years years more than years long term debt subordinated debt time deposit maturities other borrowed funds total in addition to normal loan funding  we also maintain liquidity to meet customer financing needs through unused lines of credit  unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
the level and fluctuation of these commitments is also considered in our overall liquidity management 
at december   we had a total of million in unused lines of credit  million in unfunded loan commitments and million in standby letters of credit 
liquidity of holding company the primary sources of liquidity for the company are dividends from the bank  existing cash resources and the various capital resources discussed above 
banking regulations and the laws of the state of michigan in which our bank is chartered limit the amount of dividends the bank may declare and pay to the company in any calendar year 
under the state law limitations  the bank is restricted from paying dividends to the company until its deficit retained earnings has been restored 
throughout and  the company has not received dividends from the bank and the company has suspended payment of dividends on its common stock 
under the bank s understanding with the fdic and ofir and the written agreement with the frb  the bank and the company may not pay any dividends without prior regulatory approval 
the company continued to suspend payments of cash dividends on its preferred stock during and until further action by the board of directors 
during the period that the company does not declare and pay cash dividends on its preferred stock  it may not declare and pay cash dividends on its common stock 
during and  the company also continued to exercise its right to defer interest payments on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarters or until such earlier time as is determined by further action of the board of directors 
during the deferral period  the company may not declare or pay any dividends on its common stock or preferred stock or make any payment on any outstanding debt obligations that rank equally with or junior to the trust preferred securities 
as discussed earlier  on june   the company closed its shareholder rights offering  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and future results could differ 
the allowance for loan losses  other real estate owned valuation  loss contingencies and income taxes are deemed critical due to the required level of management judgment and the use of estimates  making them particularly subject to change 
our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is described above in the allowance for loan losses discussion 
this area of accounting requires significant judgment due to the number of factors which can influence the collectability of a loan 
unanticipated changes in these factors could significantly change the level of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses 
although  based upon our internal analysis  and in our judgment  we believe that we have provided an adequate allowance for loan losses  there can be no assurance that our analysis has properly identified all of the probable losses in our loan portfolio 
as a result  we could record future provisions for loan losses that may be significantly different than the levels that we recorded in assets acquired through or instead of foreclosure  primarily other real estate owned  are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
new real estate appraisals are generally obtained at the time of foreclosure and are used to establish fair value 
if fair value declines  a valuation allowance is recorded through expense 
estimating the initial and ongoing fair value of these properties involves a number of factors and judgments including holding time  costs to complete  holding costs  discount rate  absorption and other factors 
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
this  too  is an accounting area that involves significant judgment 
although  based upon our judgment  internal analysis  and consultations with legal counsel we believe that we have properly accounted for loss contingencies  future changes in the status of such contingencies could result in a significant change in the level of contingent liabilities and a related impact to operating earnings 
our accounting for income taxes involves the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily associated with differences in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  gross deferred tax liabilities of million and a valuation allowance of million for the entire amount of net deferred tax assets 
accounting standards require that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
based upon a number of factors  including our net operating loss in recent years and the challenging environment currently confronting banks that could negatively impact future operating results  we concluded that we needed to continue to maintain a valuation allowance during for our net deferred tax assets 
changes in tax laws  changes in tax rates  changes in ownership and our future level of earnings can impact the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax asset as well as the valuation allowance that we established
