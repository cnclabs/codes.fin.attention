item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our seat reconfiguration program 
as of december   we have three owned boeing aircraft leased out to third parties on a short term basis 
the expected return dates of the leased out aircraft  under their respective leases  are through the third quarter of ground facilities we lease facilities at each of our leisure destinations and several of the other airports we serve 
our leases for our terminal passenger services facilities  which include ticket counter and gate space  and operations support areas  generally have terms of less than two years in duration and can generally be terminated with a to day notice 
we have also entered into use agreements at each of the airports we serve that provide for non exclusive use of runways  taxiways and other facilities 
landing fees under these agreements are based on the number of landings and weight of the aircraft 
we have operational bases at airports at each of the major leisure destinations we serve and additionally at bellingham  washington 
in january  we announced the establishment of an operational base at oakland international airport with seven new routes to serve the san francisco bay area starting in april we use leased facilities at our operational bases to perform line maintenance  overnight parking of aircraft  and other operations support 
we lease additional space in cargo areas at the mccarran international airport and orlando sanford international airport for our primary line maintenance operations 
we also lease additional warehouse space in las vegas for aircraft parts and supplies warehouse

we believe we have sufficient access to gate space for current and presently contemplated future operations at all other airports we serve 
our primary corporate offices are located in las vegas  where we lease approximately  square feet of space under a lease that expires in april we also lease approximately  square feet of office space in a building adjacent to our corporate offices which is utilized for training and other corporate purposes 
in addition to base rent  we are also responsible for our share of common area maintenance charges 
in both leases  the landlord is a limited liability company in which certain of our directors own significant interests as non controlling members

operating expense per asm or casm represents operating expenses divided by available seat miles 
operating casm  excluding fuel represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel  divided by available seat miles 
although operating casm  excluding fuel is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to operating expenses as an indicator of our financial performance  this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors and therefore are beyond our control

this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the section entitled special note about forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
results the year was another successful year for us  our ninth straight year of profitability  while introducing our first boeing aircraft into revenue service  beginning our md seat reconfiguration program and further development in our system automation upgrades 
during  we earned million of net income or per share diluted on operating revenues of million 
we experienced unit revenues at the highest levels in our history  with a total average fare increase of to for  which was achieved despite a increase in system capacity 
the total average fare performance during the year allowed us to more than offset the effect of high fuel prices as our entire fuel cost increase was attributable to unit cost increases 
our system average cost per gallon increased from during to in our strong operating revenue results were driven by a increase in scheduled service revenue per available seat mile prasm 
in addition to the prasm increase  strong third party ancillary product sales for hotel room bookings and rental car sales contributed to a increase in total scheduled service revenue and ancillary revenue per asm trasm for compared with the same period of we believe our improvement in unit revenue production was due to changes to our pricing strategy  our aggressive capacity management and a strong leisure demand environment 
during  our operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel increased  or  to  with a main driver being increased maintenance and repairs expense compared to prior years 
maintenance and repairs expense increased million  or  due primarily from increased engine overhauls year over year 
in late  due to multiple factors  we changed our approach to engine overhauls 
in recent years  we overhauled very few of our engines and instead purchased engine replacements in the secondary market 
we are currently managing our engine needs through a combination of performing engine overhauls and purchasing fewer engines for replacement purposes 
during  our engine overhauls and repairs expense totaled million 
we began with approximately of our engine pool having fewer than  cycles since overhaul  as compared to just of our engines in january we believe this will increase operational reliability and reduce the extent of the significant variations from period to period in our maintenance and repairs expense which we have experienced in the recent past 
during  we also made notable progress on a number of ongoing capital projects and have begun to see returns from these projects 
we introduced our first boeing aircraft into revenue service in july  and believe the larger aircraft will provide additional revenue opportunities while reducing unit costs associated with its operations 
the first md aircraft from our seat reconfiguration program entered revenue service during third quarter and we have nine in revenue service as of february  we believe these additional seats will be accretive to earnings as they will allow us to grow capacity without adding incremental aircraft into our operating fleet 
our strategy is to convert each base to seat md aircraft as soon as possible to optimize the selling effort in that particular base 
another area of significant investment during has been automation  as we have continued to work on the upgrade of our current system platform 
we expect the continued improvement of our website and other automation enhancements will allow us to capitalize on customer loyalty with additional product offerings 
lastly  we executed our first capital market debt transaction during the year as we closed a million senior secured term loan facility the term loan in march the term loan matures on march  and bears interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor or prime rate with interest payable quarterly or more frequently until maturity 
the proceeds from this transaction have provided us the ability  along with our cash from operations  to fund our capital expenditures needs for the future  and provide further financial flexibility to grow the business and weather sudden industry disruptions or us macroeconomic events 
aircraft operating fleet as of december   our total aircraft in service consisted of md aircraft and one boeing during  we placed five md aircraft and one boeing into service  along with the permanent withdrawal of one md aircraft seat md  which increased our aircraft in service to aircraft at december  the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated as of december  as of december  as of december  own a b lease c total b own a lease d total own a e lease total md s mds f b total a does not include aircraft owned  but not added to our operating fleet as of the date indicated 
see below for further information on our aircraft not yet in our operating fleet 
b includes seven md aircraft md s modified to a seat configuration 
c in december  we exercised purchase options on two md aircraft and took ownership of these aircraft in january subsequent to taking ownership of these two aircraft in january  we no longer have any aircraft under operating leases 
d in february  we exercised purchase options on two md aircraft under operating leases 
in october  we took ownership of these aircraft 
e includes two md aircraft subject to capital leases as of december  in september  we exercised early purchase options and took ownership of these two aircraft 
f used almost exclusively for fixed fee flying 
md aircraft not in service as of december   two of our md aircraft previously in storage are being modified to a seat reconfiguration and expected to enter revenue service in the first quarter of subsequent to these two md aircraft being modified to seats  the remaining aircraft in the seat reconfiguration program will be removed from aircraft in service 
there is also one additional md aircraft in storage which could be used for future growth opportunities 
boeing aircraft as of december   we owned four boeing aircraft  of which three were leased out to third parties on a short term basis  and one is in revenue service 
the expected return dates of the leased out aircraft  under their respective leases  are through the third quarter of we expect these three aircraft to be added to revenue service through the first half of we obtained approval from the federal aviation administration faa to begin operating the boeing aircraft type in our operating fleet and in july  initiated service with the aircraft on two of our routes to las vegas 
two additional boeing aircraft remain to be purchased under our previous contract 
we expect to close on these aircraft during the first half of  with introduction of these aircraft into our fleet during the first half of we continue our efforts to gain flag carrier status and complete the etops certification process with the goal to launch service with our boeing aircraft to hawaii in the second half of network we have increased the number of routes into our leisure destinations from at december  to routes at december  we now serve cities in states including small cities and destinations through our route network 
the following shows the number of destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated includes cities served seasonally as of december  as of december  as of december  major leisure destinations other leisure destinations small cities served total cities served routes to las vegas routes to orlando airports a routes to phoenix routes to tampa bay st 
petersburg routes to los angeles routes to ft 
lauderdale other routes total routes a from february until february  we served both orlando international airport and orlando sanford international airport 
in february  we have consolidated our orlando operations back to our original operational base at orlando sanford international airport 
trends and uncertainties oil prices have stabilized during the second half of  but at levels resulting in an increase of our system average cost per gallon to  a increase from in this system average cost per gallon for was higher than the per gallon we experienced in when fuel reached peak levels 
fuel availability is subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for heating oil  gasoline and other petroleum products 
the cost of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty and further fuel cost volatility will most likely have a significant impact on our future results of operations 
we will continue to try to offset these fuel prices through our continued focus on capacity management  driving additional ancillary revenues and the execution of our low fixed  high variable cost model 
we remain pleased with the strength and flexibility of our model and believe it has proven successful to maintain profitability in a high fuel price environment 
we continue to expand our route network and extend our national footprint with the focus on serving residents of small cities 
our national footprint is well balanced and is not dependant on one particular market or geographic region 
in january  we announced the establishment of an operational base and expansion of service at oakland international airport with seven new routes to serve the san francisco bay area starting in april we also anticipate service to hawaii in the second half of upon completion of our etops certification 
in january  revisions and expansions to a variety of dot consumer protection regulations became effective 
among other changes  the new rules substantially reduce the flexibility concerning airline advertising and sales practices  including on websites 
these new regulations curtail our ability to advertise  price and sell our services in the particular manner we have developed and found most advantageous  forcing a more homogenized industry approach to advertising and sales 
future dot rulemaking in this regard may impose further restrictions on us 
although we are taking steps to minimize the extent of any negative impact and we are challenging certain of the new rules in court  our revenues could be adversely affected in the long term 
we expect to transfer over to our new website in first quarter and continue to enhance our website offerings to our customers 
we believe this will in time provide significant revenue opportunities on which we hope to capitalize 
our operating revenue our operating revenue comprises of both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of air fare for nonstop flights on our route network 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from air related charges and third party products

seasonality 
our business is seasonal in nature with traffic demand historically being weaker in the third quarter and stronger in the first quarter 
our operating revenue is largely driven by perceived product value  advertising and promotional activities and can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced leisure travel spending  such as the back to school season 
our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
aircraft fuel expense

results of operations compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily driven by a increase in our total average fare from to and a increase in scheduled service passengers 
we believe stronger travel demand  changes in our pricing strategy and aggressive capacity management contributed to the improvement in total average fare 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  up from million in the increase was primarily driven by a increase in the average base fare for compared to  along with a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers 
the significant increase in average base fare was achieved despite a increase in capacity 
passenger growth was driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service departures and a slight increase in scheduled service load factor  up almost one percentage point to for ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from to and a increase in scheduled service passengers 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  percentage change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products 
third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp hotel room nights rental car days during  we generated gross revenue of million from third party products  which resulted in net revenue of million 
third party products increased on a per passenger basis primarily as a result of increased hotel room bookings and margin expansion  when compared to the prior year 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue increased to million during from million for the increase in fixed fee contract revenue was primarily attributable to flying under an agreement with peppermill resorts inc flying began in january  which more than offset the reduction in fixed fee flying under the caesars entertainment inc caesars agreement 
block hours flown under our fixed fee flying agreement with caesars decreased from  block hours in to  in other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million for compared to million for  primarily from lease revenue for aircraft and flight equipment 
in the first quarter of  we leased three boeing aircraft to third parties on a short term basis 
the expected return dates of these aircraft  under their respective leases  are through the third quarter of operating expenses our operating expenses increased to million for compared to million in we primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger and per asms across different periods which enable us to assess trends in each expense category 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
the table also presents operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by the number of passengers carried 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods 
the table also presents operating casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by available seat miles 
as on a per passenger basis  excluding fuel on an asm basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel our casm  excluding fuel  increased  primarily from increases in maintenance and repairs expense  salaries and benefits expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
lower aircraft utilization inherent in our capacity management plan for the period and a decrease in system average stage length contributed to the increase in casm excluding fuel as increasing total costs were spread over only a slightly higher number of asms compared to the prior year 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased million or to million for  up from million in  primarily driven by a increase in the system average cost per gallon from to 
in addition  the expansion of crack spreads for jet fuel continued to impact our system average cost per gallon during salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in  due to a increase in our salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee 
the increase in our salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee was driven by our new pilot and flight attendant compensation agreements which went into effect in may and july  respectively 
the number of full time equivalent employees decreased from  as of december  to  as of december   with the outsourcing of our station operations in las vegas beginning in may resulting in this decrease 
station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of a increase in station operations expense per departure and a increase in system departures 
the increase in station operations expense per departure was attributable to increases in ground handling fees at several airports where we operate  along with outsourcing of our station operations in las vegas beginning in may maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million for compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased engine overhauls of million during compared to the prior year 
increases in the repair of rotable parts and usage of expendable parts associated with an increase in average number of our aircraft in service from in to for also contributed to our increased maintenance and repairs expense 
the increase in engine overhauls and repairs was driven by a new md engine maintenance strategy which began in late prior to that  fewer engine overhauls were performed and instead were replaced with engines acquired in the secondary market 
as a result of having more than of our engines with fewer than  cycles at the beginning of  we expect maintenance and repair expense to return to more traditional levels in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in due to higher credit card transaction costs associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue and an increase in advertising expenses driven by entrance into new markets 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased  from million in to million in two of our md aircraft were under operating lease agreements during  compared to four aircraft during the majority of in december  we exercised purchased options on these two aircraft under operating leases and took ownership of the aircraft in january upon taking ownership of these two aircraft in january  we no longer have any aircraft under operating leases 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of primarily driven by additional depreciation expense from boeing and md aircraft and engines 
our boeing aircraft include three aircraft leased to third parties during and one placed into revenue service in july we ended with aircraft in service as compared to aircraft at the end of other expense 
other expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily driven by losses associated with one md aircraft we permanently grounded during the second quarter of  the disposal of one engine  along with the write down of engine values in our consignment program 
in addition  we had an increase in our administrative expenses associated with our growth  such as property taxes and software support  which contributed to the overall increase in other operating expenses 
other income expense other income expense increased from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the increase is due to a million increase in interest expense in primarily associated with our million term loan borrowing in march income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the higher effective tax rate for was largely due to the impact of apportionment factor adjustments to filed state income tax returns which contributed to an increase in our state income tax expense 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates 
compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a increase in scheduled service revenue and a increase in ancillary revenue 
scheduled service revenue and ancillary revenue increases were primarily driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers on a increase in scheduled service departures 
the increase in scheduled service passengers combined with an overall strengthening in the us economy allowed us to increase our average base airfare or to in from system available seat miles asms increased by as a result of a increase in system departures and a increase in system average stage length 
operating revenue per asm rasm increased from during to during as the rate of increase in total operating revenue slightly exceeded the increase in our capacity 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million in  up from million in the increase was primarily driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers  along with an increase in the scheduled service average base fare for compared to passenger growth was driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service departures and a slight increase in scheduled service load factor  up percentage points to 
the increase in departure growth was driven by the increase in routes to our phoenix market  los angeles market with commencement of flying to long beach in july which has been discontinued in november and route expansion of our seasonal service during to myrtle beach and punta gorda 
overall  our route network expanded from routes served at december  to served at december  ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  percentage change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger the increase in air related charges per passenger was primarily attributable to higher baggage fees and booking fees in the comparable periods 
we increased baggage fees to comparable industry levels 
in addition  we transitioned to an open seating model for customers who do not purchase our assigned seat product 
this resulted in an increase in take rates and overall revenue production for our priority boarding and assigned seat products 
ancillary revenue from third party products increased in on a per passenger basis as a result of increased volume of sales per passenger and increased margins on the sale of hotel rooms compared to the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp hotel room nights rental car days a includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue decreased to million during from million for increased flying for the department of defense during was more than offset by the cessation in of fixed fee flying under the cuban family charter program and under an agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc fixed fee flying under our agreement with caesars entertainment inc formerly harrah s entertainment inc 
partially offset this decrease as the number of block hours flown under the agreement increased by for compared to other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million for compared to million for during which other revenue was primarily leases of flight equipment to third parties

salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million in up from million in excluding accrued employee bonus expense and stock compensation expense  salary and benefits expense increased attributable to a increase in salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee and a increase in the number of full time equivalent employees from december  to december  we entered into new compensation agreements with our pilots and flight attendants which went into effect in may and july respectively 
these new compensation arrangements accounted for the majority of the year over year increase in salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employees 
in addition to these agreements  we experienced higher medical premiums and increased k contributions which were offset by a reduction in employee accrued bonus expense due to a lower level of profitability compared to station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of a in system departures and a increase in station operations expense per departure 
our expense per departure increase was primarily attributable to increased airport and common use fees at some of our leisure destination airports 
as capacity is reduced at these airports  which was the case in and  airports reallocate costs among remaining carriers 
in addition we operated out of orlando international airport from the first quarter until first quarter  which has approximately higher operating costs than those at orlando sanford international airport 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million in compared to million in as the average number of aircraft in service increased from aircraft during to during the timing of maintenance events may cause our maintenance and repairs expense to vary significantly from period to period 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in due to higher credit card transaction costs associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue 
the increase in transaction costs were partially offset by reductions in credit card rates and small city advertising expenses 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased  from million in to million in for all of and a majority of  we operated four leased aircraft 
in october we took ownership of two of our leased aircraft though the exercise of purchase options leaving two aircraft under operating leases in our fleet at the end of depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of  driven by a increase in the number of operating aircraft 
we ended with aircraft in revenue service as compared with in additionally  depreciation and amortization expense excluding aircraft and aircraft related parts increased as we continued to invest in our ground service equipment and information technology infrastructure 
other expense 
other expense increased to million for compared to million for  attributable to an increase in administrative expenses associated with our growth  such as facility rent for our corporate headquarters and aircraft insurance 
in addition  we incurred pre operating expenses associated with the certification process for the boeing aircraft type which began in the first quarter of expenses related to this process were approximately million in these increases were offset by a lower loss from the disposal of assets which were million in and million in other income expense other income expense decreased from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the change is primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances partially offset by a reduction of interest income earned on cash balances in compared to income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the lower effective tax rate for was largely due to the geographic mix of our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources during  our primary sources of funds were cash generated by our operations and cash borrowed under the million term loan 
our operating cash flows have allowed us to maintain a high level of liquidity while growing our fleet and meeting our short term obligations 
our future capital needs are generally for the purchase of additional aircraft for which we had million of obligations as of december  under existing aircraft purchase agreements 
in addition  our capital needs include a seat reconfiguration program for our md aircraft fleet which we expect to have completed by the end of we believe we have adequate liquidity resources through our operating cash flows and the proceeds from the term loan to meet our future capital obligations 
current liquidity cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investment securities short term and long term totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
restricted cash represents credit card deposits  cash collateral against notes payable  escrowed funds under our fixed fee flying contracts  and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel partners for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
investment securities represent highly liquid marketable securities which are available for sale 
during  we were able to decrease our restricted cash balance by million primarily from lower amounts on a number of existing letters of credit issued to our hotel vendors and some airports  along with other funds no longer held under restriction  including a portion of cash collateral against notes payable 
under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 
sources and uses of cash operating activities 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during we generated more cash from operating activities in than as a result of an increase in non cash items of depreciation and amortization and the change in our deferred income taxes  along with a higher increase in our air traffic liability 
in addition  cash from operating activities in was reduced by the prepayment of million for access to hotel rooms for sale through an agreement with one of our key las vegas hotel partners 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million of cash provided by investment activities in during  our primary use of cash was for the investment of proceeds from the term loan in investment securities and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
purchases of property and equipment during consisted primarily of the cash purchase of two boeing aircraft  expenditures associated with our seat reconfiguration program and other engine and flight equipment purchases 
during  proceeds from maturities and sales of our short term investments net of purchases were offset partially by the use of cash for the purchase of property and equipment 
market conditions and a relatively flat interest rate curve during resulted in a higher amount of proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments  net of purchases  being used in for the purchase of investments with less than three month maturities which are classified as cash equivalents 
purchases of property and equipment during consisted of cash purchases of aircraft and induction costs associated with aircraft including payment of pre delivery deposits on four boeing aircraft 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to million used for net of deferred financing costs  we received million from the term loan and the issuance of notes payable associated with two loans secured by boeing aircraft 
cash received from these financing activities was offset by million of principal debt payments  with the majority of this amount attributable to early payment on existing debt obligations secured by md aircraft in anticipation of the pledge of these aircraft under the term loan 
in addition  during  we used million of cash for stock repurchases

debt our long term debt obligations increased from million as of december  to million as of december  as of december   all of our in service md and boeing aircraft were pledged to secure our debt obligations 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual cash obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due in thousands total less than year years to years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations aircraft purchase obligations total future payments on contractual obligations long term debt obligations include scheduled interest payments 
operating lease obligations include aircraft operating leases and leases of office space and airport station property 
in january  we took ownership of two md aircraft for which we exercised purchase options in december and were operating under operating lease agreements 
as a result of exercising the purchase options for these aircraft  there were no contractual cash obligations from these operating lease agreements at december  aircraft purchase obligations under existing aircraft purchase agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had operated two of our aircraft under operating leases which were not reflected on our balance sheet 
in january  we took ownership of these two aircraft after the exercise of purchase options 
upon taking ownership of these aircraft  we no longer have any aircraft under operating leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and judgments affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
revenue recognition 
scheduled service revenue consists of passenger revenue generated from limited frequency nonstop flights in our route network recognized when the travel related service or transportation is provided or when the itinerary expires unused 
nonrefundable scheduled itineraries expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer in advance 
itineraries sold for transportation  but not yet used  as well as unexpired credits  are included in air traffic liability 
various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities 
these taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of income and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority 
fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of long term agreements to provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis 
fixed fee contract revenue is recognized when the transportation is provided 
ancillary revenue consists of passenger revenue from air related charges and third party products 
air related charges include optional services provided to passengers such as the use of our website to purchase scheduled service transportation  advance seat assignments  priority boarding  our travel protection product and other services 
revenues from air related charges are recognized when the transportation is provided if the product is not deemed independent of the scheduled service 
revenues from change fees imposed on passengers for making changes to nonrefundable itineraries are recognized as they occur 
ancillary revenue is also generated from third party products such as the sale of hotel rooms  rental cars  ticket attractions and other items 
revenues from the sale of third party products are recognized at the time the product is utilized  such as the time a purchased hotel room is occupied 
the amount of revenues attributed to each element of a bundled sale involving air related charges and third party products in addition to airfare is determined in accordance with accounting standards for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the sale of ancillary revenue products is recorded net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees in accordance with revenue reporting accounting standards 
other revenue is generated from leased out aircraft and flight equipment and other miscellaneous sources 
lease revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
to the extent a change in estimate for useful lives of our md aircraft fleet occurs  there could result an acceleration of depreciation expense associated with the change in estimate 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
we account for aircraft maintenance activities under the direct expense method 
under this method  maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft  including major aircraft maintenance activities  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
as a lessee  we may be required under provisions of our lease agreements to make payments to the lessor in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities 
these payments of maintenance deposits are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours or cycles  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
accounting guidance for maintenance deposits requires these payments to be accounted for as an asset until reimbursed for incurred maintenance costs or until it is determined that any portion of the estimated total of the deposit is less than probable of being returned 
we had no maintenance deposits as of december  or december  investment securities 
we maintain a liquid portfolio of investment securities available for current operations and to satisfy on going obligations 
we have classified these investments as available for sale and accordingly  unrealized gains or losses are reported as a component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
stock based compensation 
we issued stock based awards  including restricted stock  stock options and stock appreciation rights sars to certain officers  directors  employees and consultants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using a fair value approach 
determining the fair value requires judgment  and we use the black scholes valuation model for stock options and sars issued 
significant judgment is required to establish the assumptions to be used in the black scholes valuation model 
these assumptions are for the volatility of our common stock  estimated term over which our stock options and sars will be outstanding  and interest rate to be applied 
we use our closing share price on the grant date as the fair value for issuances of restricted stock 
expected volatilities used for the awards in were based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
no stock options or sars were granted during expected volatilities for the awards issued in were based on the historical volatilities from publicly traded airline companies of our peer group due to the lack of longer term historical information on our common stock price for the period 
we changed the basis for our expected volatilities to use historical volatility of our common stock as a result of the availability of more historical stock information 
expected term represents the weighted average time between the option s grant date and its exercise date 
we estimated our expected term assumption in using historical award exercise activity and employee termination activity 
we used the simplified method from accounting guidance for companies with a limited trading history to estimate the expected term on award grants 
we changed the basis for our expected term to the use of historical award exercise activity and employee termination activity as a result of the availability of historical award information 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the expected term of the stock option is based on a blended historical rate using federal reserve rates for us treasury securities
