item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis reflects the company s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data 
we include it to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the information in this section in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this annual report on form k  and other statistical data provided herein 
overview financial condition and results of operations 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earnings assets and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
it is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus average balances of deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds 
on july   the company completed its acquisition of sterling banks inc  at the time of the merger  sterling had million in total assets  million in loans receivable and million in deposits 
pursuant to purchase accounting  the company s results of operations include the effect of the merger subsequent to july  our interest earning assets primarily consist of loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
at december   net loans comprised of our total assets and our securities portfolio comprised of our total assets 
the most significant change in interest earning assets from the prior year was a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans receivable  net from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this growth in average assets was primarily due to the merger in july of at year end  actual loans receivable  net  totaled million  an increase of million over the prior year 
during and  a key goal of management was growth in the loan portfolio  particularly multi family and commercial real estate loans 
multi family and commercial real estate loans increased by  or million  from to during  the amount of mortgage backed securities increased million 
our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of retail deposits  borrowings from the fhlbny  and  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
at december   our total deposits were billion  compared to billion at december  the million  or  increase in deposits was in all product areas 
management tightly controlled the deposit pricing  because of excess liquidity from deposits  thereby lowering the cost of funds 
borrowings from the fhlbny were million compared to million a year earlier 
the company acquired in the merger million of subordinated debt maturing in with an interest rate of 
in october  the company repaid million of the debt  at a discounted amount 
our net interest income increased to million in  from million in the net interest spread decreased to from in  as the average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  while the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points 
for  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was and the average yield on interest earning assets was 
total interest income increased  due to a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  but was offset by a basis point decrease in average yield 
interest expense increased  reflecting a increase in average interest bearing liabilities  but benefitted from a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
our results of operations are also influenced by our provisions for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
the provision for loan losses increased as we added to the reserves as collateral values declined and increased our percentages in various environmental areas for the general reserve 
non interest income includes service fees and charges  including income generated by the banks retail branch networks and operations  income from bank owned life insurance  and title insurance revenue from our title agency subsidiary 
non interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non interest income decreased million to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to income from the recovery of virtually all of the write down of an equity security of million 
non interest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to expenses related to the merger and the ten branches also acquired in the merger for a full year in net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  total assets increased million  or  to billion  from billion at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from year to year 
loans receivable  net  increased million  available for sale securities decreased million  investments held to maturity decreased million  while mortgage backed securities increased million at december   as compared to december  stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  due to net income offset by dividend payments and stock repurchases 
business strategy 
our current business strategy is to seek growth and improve profitability by increasing the volume of loan originations and the size of our loan portfolio relative to our securities portfolio  increasing originations of multi family and commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans  maintaining high asset quality  lowering the level of non performing assets  building core banking business through internal growth and growing our branches  and judiciously considering expansion through acquisition opportunities  and developing a sales culture by training and encouraging branch personnel to promote existing products and services to our customers 
historically  our deposits have exceeded our residential loan originations  and we have invested those deposits primarily in mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
over the last few years we have focused on building a non residential loan portfolio 
critical accounting policies 
our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported and are described in detail in note to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and income for the periods then ended 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate primarily to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses known and inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we consider the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
we utilize a segmented approach which identifies impaired loans for which specific reserves are established  classified loans for which a higher allowance is established  and performing loans for which a general valuation allowance is established 
we maintain a loan review system which provides for a systematic review of the loan portfolios and the early identification of impaired loans 
the review of residential real estate and home equity consumer loans  as well as other more complex loans  is triggered by identified evaluation factors  including delinquency status  size of loan  type of collateral and the financial condition of the borrower 
all commercial loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
specific loan loss allowances are established for impaired loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of the underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
although specific and general loan loss allowances are established in accordance with management s best estimate  actual losses are dependent upon future events  and as such  further provisions for loan losses may be necessary in order to increase the level of the allowance for loan losses 
for example  our evaluation of the allowance includes consideration of current economic conditions  and a change in economic conditions could reduce the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans 
this could result in increased delinquencies and increased non performing loans  and thus a need to make increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
any such increase in provisions would result in a reduction to our earnings 
a change in economic conditions could also adversely affect the value of properties collateralizing real estate loans  resulting in increased charges against the allowance and reduced recoveries  and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  a change in the composition  or growth  of our loan portfolio could result in the need for additional provisions 
acquired loans 
loans that we acquired in the acquisition of sterling bank subsequent to january   were recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses 
determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest 
the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount or premium and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
the difference between the contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non accretable discount 
the nonaccretable discount represents estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows require us to evaluate the need for an allowance for credit losses 
subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result in the reversal of a corresponding amount of the nonacretable discount which we then reclassify as accretable discount that is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the interest method 
our evaluation of the amount of future cash flows that we expect to collect is performed in a similar manner as that used to determine our allowance for credit losses 
charge offs of the principal amount on acquired loans would be first applied to the nonaccretable discount portion of the fair value adjustment

provision for loan losses 
we charge provisions for loan losses to operations at levels required to reflect credit losses in the loan portfolios that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 
management  in determining the allowance for loan losses  considers the losses inherent in the loan portfolios and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activities  along with the general economic and real estate market conditions 
we utilize a two tier approach establishment of general valuation allowances in the remainder of our loan portfolio  and we establish a specific loan loss allowance for an impaired loan based on delinquency status  size of loan  type of collateral and or appraisal of the underlying collateral and financial condition of the borrower 
management bases general loan loss allowances on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
the overall growth in the loan portfolio  particularly in commercial loans  is expected to result in higher provisions going forward 
the provision for loan losses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year

in december  the banks worked with a consultant to validate and strengthen the peer  internal risk and historical data driving our allowance for loan loss methodology 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  additional loan loss provisions in the future may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions

the banks primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of mortgage backed securities and outstanding loans  maturities of investment securities and funds provided from operations 
in addition  the banks invest excess funds in short term interest earnings assets such as overnight deposits or us agency securities  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  general interest rates  economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities 
the banks are required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
the banks attempt to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity  and liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
the banks review cash flow projections regularly and update them in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations  including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals 
at december   the banks had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million  and unused lines of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million 
while deposits are the banks primary source of funds  they also generate cash through borrowings from the fhlbny 
the banks have traditionally enjoyed cash flows from deposit activities that were sufficient to meet their day to day funding obligations and only occasionally used overnight lines of credit or other borrowings with the fhlbny 
in october  roma bank borrowed million from the fhlbny at  interest only quarterly  for ten years with a three year call 
at december   roma bank s borrowing limit with the fhlbny was million 
roma bank also had at december  securities sold under an agreement to repurchase in the amount of million 
romasia bank at december  had million of short term advances with fhlbny 
the following table discloses our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  total less than year years years after years in thousands federal home loan bank borrowings securities sold under agreement to repurchase total amounts committed less than year years years over years in thousands lines of credit construction loans in process other commitments to extend credit total roma bank has non cancelable operating leases for branch offices 
the following is a schedule by years of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at december  years ended december in thousands thereafter total minimum payments required included in the total required minimum lease payments are million of payments to the llc a variable interest entity in which the company hold a ownership interest

consistent with their goals to operate sound and profitable financial organizations  the banks actively seek to maintain their status as well capitalized institutions in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december   the banks exceeded all capital requirements of the office of the controller of currency 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving banks facilities 
these financial instruments include significant purchase commitments  such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase investment securities or mortgage backed securities  and commitments to extend credit to meet the financial needs of our customers 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
for additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at december   see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
impact of inflation the financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of non interest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk qualitative analysis 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  a significant form of market risk for us is interest rate risk  or changes in interest rates 
we derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
in general  the larger the spread  the more we earn 
when market rates of interest change  the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate 
this can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income 
the rates that we earn on our assets are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
we  like many savings institutions  have liabilities that have generally shorter contractual maturities than our assets  such as certificates of deposit  or have no stated maturity  such as savings and money market deposits 
this imbalance can create significant volatility because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on our assets  which consist primarily of long term fixed rate securities  may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities 
while the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates  which we use as a guide to our deposit pricing  have decreased  intermediate and long term market interest rates  which we use as a guide to our loan pricing  have decreased to a larger extent than deposit rates 
although the yield curve has steepened  competitive deposit rates in our market areas have not permitted the bank to lower rates in proportion to loan rates 
this has lead to a tightening of our interest spread 
if short term interest rates continue to be high in the market area  we would expect that our interest spread and net interest margin would continue to compress  which would hurt our net interest income 
a falling rate environment would result in a decrease in rates we pay on deposits and borrowings  but the decrease in the cost of our funds may not be as great at the decrease in the yields on our loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities and loan portfolios 
this could cause a narrowing of our net interest rate spread and could cause a decrease in our earnings

future interest rates or their effect on net portfolio value or net interest income are not predictable 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  prepayments  and deposit run offs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of repricing  they may react in different times and in different degrees to changes in the marker interest rates 
the interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities  such as demand deposits and savings accounts  may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above 
additionally  an increased credit risk may result as the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
notwithstanding the discussion above  the quantitative interest rate analysis presented above indicates that a rapid increase in interest rates would adversely affect our net interest margin and earnings
