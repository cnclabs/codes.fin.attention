other mobile imaging software solutions we offer include mobile photo bill pay  a mobile bill payment product that allows users to pay their bills using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet  mobile balance transfer  a product that allows credit card issuers to provide an offer to users and transfer an existing credit card balance by capturing an image of the user s current credit card statement  mobile enrollment  a product that enables users to enroll their checking account as a funding source for mobile payments by taking a photo of a blank check with their camera equipped smartphone or tablet  and mobile photo quoting  a product that enables users to receive insurance quotes by using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet to take a picture of their driver s license and insurance card 
our mobile imaging software solutions can be deployed on all major smartphone and tablet operating systems 
we market and sell our mobile imaging software solutions through channel partners or directly to enterprise customers and end users that typically purchase licenses based on the number of transactions or subscribers that use our mobile software 
our mobile imaging software solutions are often embedded in other mobile banking or enterprise applications developed by banks  insurance companies or their partners  and marketed under their own proprietary brands 
we are headquartered in san diego  california and were incorporated in the state of delaware on may  product and technology overview our family of mobile imaging solutions and intelligent character recognition software is provided as a software platform 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had one operating segment  document image processing and image analytics  based on our product and service offerings that use our intelligent character recognition and document capture technology 
our proprietary character recognition software is used to enable the automation of costly  labor intensive business functions 
our technology processes images of documents in many ways  including quality analysis  image repair  document identification and the extraction of hand printed and machine printed text 
our capabilities can be deployed on any back office  industrial or desktop scanner  or on camera equipped smartphones or tablets  to optimize and extract data from any scanned or photographed check  bill or other financial document 
our capabilities include mobile document capture  image repair and optimization  optical character recognition ocr and intelligent character recognition icr  dynamic data location  distributed capture  courtesy amount recognition and legal amount recognition  and image analysis of signatures 
our proprietary  patented technology is able to read and extract data from an image of financial and identity documents  in essence turning camera equipped smartphones and tablets into virtual scanning devices 

table of contents our patented technology combines our core character recognition technology with advanced mobile image processing capabilities that transform a four color photograph of a document into a digital image that is equivalent in size  resolution and quality to scanned documents 
unlike scanned documents  mobile photographs of documents captured by smartphones and tablets are exposed to variable lighting conditions and various angles and focal distances 
raw photos of documents taken by a smartphone or tablet may be of an unknown size and resolution from the original document and are often geometrically distorted  skewed or warped 
as a result  the raw mobile document image is virtually unusable without our technology 
our technology uses advanced algorithms designed to identify and correct geometric and optical distortions and automatically correct each mobile document image 
mobile imaging solutions the majority of our revenue in the fiscal years ended september  and was generated by our mobile deposit product  which we sell to customers in the financial services industry including bankserv  bluepoint solutions  inc  cachet financial solutions  ensenta corporation  fiserv  inc  fidelity national information services fis  jack henry associates  inc  ncr corporation  rdm corporation  transcentra  inc  wausau financial systems  inc 
and others 
our other imaging solutions  which include mobile photo bill pay  mobile balance transfer  mobile enrollment  and mobile photo quoting  are primarily sold directly to enterprise customers and end users 
mobile deposit as of september   financial institutions  including of the top us retail banks and payment processing companies  have signed agreements to deploy our mobile deposit product 
of the financial institutions  have deployed mobile deposit with their customers 
our mobile deposit product was the first to utilize our mobile imaging analytics and character recognition software to allow financial institutions to accept check deposits via images of checks taken with camera equipped smartphones and tablets 
mobile deposit allows users to make deposits by photographing the front and back of a check and submitting the image electronically to their bank using their smartphone or tablet 
we began selling mobile deposit in the third fiscal quarter of  and received our first of five patents issued for this product  patent no 
 in august   for the method and systems for mobile image capture and processing of checks 
mobile photo bill pay mobile photo bill pay provides a new level of service and convenience for customers who want to pay bills using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet 
mobile photo bill pay connects to existing online bill pay systems and allows users to pay bills by taking pictures with their smartphone or tablet camera 
the core technology of mobile photo bill pay enables this process by correcting image distortion  reading relevant data and processing the transaction through the user s bank 
with mobile photo bill pay  users can submit electronic payments from their smartphones or tablets without having to write checks  buy stamps  visit a payment location or even use their personal computers 
mobile balance transfer mobile balance transfer is a simple  cost effective way for financial institutions to acquire new credit card customers 
mobile balance transfer accurately and securely converts data from an image of the user s credit card statement to a balance transfer offer 
the customer can accept the offer with a single touch of a button and the bank can then automatically transfer the balance and establish a new credit card account 
mobile enrollment mobile enrollment makes it convenient and easy for customers to use their camera equipped smartphone or tablet to set up an auto debit from their bank account and enable electronic funds transfers  thereby eliminating manual enrollment processes 

table of contents mobile photo quoting mobile photo quoting enables property and casualty insurance companies to provide an insurance quote to potential customers using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet 
rather than requiring the user to manually complete a form  mobile photo quoting extracts the data from the user s driver s license and insurance card to provide a quote via a smartphone or tablet 
intelligent character recognition software products our intelligent character recognition products are marketed under the brand imagenet  which leverage our proprietary intelligent character recognition and data extraction software engines 
our imagenet products are designed to provide a high level of accuracy in remittance processing  proof of deposit and lock box processing applications 
these products are used to reduce manual labor by automatically extracting amounts and routing information from checks and distinguishing between common document types  such as personal and business checks  substitute checks  pre authorized drafts and other document types specified by customers 
we sell our imagenet products to our channel partners who resell them as integrated components of their solutions and services 
intellectual property our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technology 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other measures 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party  our operating results could be adversely affected 
as of september   the us patent and trademark office the pto had issued patents to us and we have filed for nine additional domestic and international patents 
we have registered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate 
we claim common law protection for  and may seek to register  other trademarks 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
sales and marketing we market our products and services primarily through channel partners as well as through our internal  direct sales organization 
we have an internal marketing group that develops corporate and product marketing strategies and executes marketing plans with the support of external resources as needed 
we employ a technically oriented sales force with management assistance to identify the needs of existing and prospective customers 
our sales strategy concentrates on oems  systems integrators  distributors  and software solution companies that we believe are key users and designers of automated document processing systems for high performance  large volume applications  in addition to financial institutions that are positioning themselves in the mobile remote capture market 
in addition  we sell and support our products through foreign resellers 
the sales process is supported by a broad range of marketing programs  including trade shows  direct marketing  public relations and advertising 
for the fiscal year ended september   we derived revenue of approximately  from three customers  with such customers accounting for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
for the fiscal year ended september   we derived revenue of approximately  from two customers  with such customers accounting for and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during fiscal years ended september  and  sales of software licenses to channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue 
this customer concentration is attributable to the timing of the purchase or renewal of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any one channel partner 
if we were to lose a channel partner relationship  we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell the previously purchased products to customers 
however  such a relationship could take time to develop  if it develops at all 

table of contents international sales accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we sell our products in us currency only 
competition our mobile imaging products address a new market for the use of camera equipped smartphones and tablets and therefore face emerging competition 
we believe our products are among the first smartphone and tablet solutions of their kind  but we anticipate growing competition as the market matures 
the market for mobile image processing software products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and solutions to our current and potential customers 
our principal competition comes from i customer developed solutions  ii companies offering automated document processing systems  iii companies offering competing technologies capable of recognizing hand printed and cursive characters  and iv companies offering check imaging systems to banks 
it is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants or alternative technologies 
moreover  as the market for automated document processing  icr  check imaging and fraud detection software develops  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to enter or increase their presence in our industry  either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  or otherwise increase their focus on the industry 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and potential customers 
our products are compliant with service oriented architecture standards and compete  to various degrees  with products produced by a number of substantial competitors 
competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on price  accuracy  reliability and technical support 
we believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are i recognition accuracy with regard to hand printed characters  ii flexibility resulting from the ability of our products to operate in several microsoft web services environments  iii scalability  and iv an architectural software design that allows our products to be more readily modified  improved with added functionality and configured for new products  thereby allowing our software to be easily upgraded 
despite these advantages  imagenet competitors have existed longer and have far greater financial resources and industry connections than we have 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
maintenance and support we provide ongoing software support services to assist our customers with the use and maintenance of our software 
we have an internal customer service department that handles installation and maintenance requirements 
the majority of the inquiries we receive are handled by telephone and electronic mail 
we maintain our customers software largely through releases that provide our customers with technology enhancements and incremental features 
substantially all of our customers purchase post contract support from us 
these services are a significant source of our recurring revenue and they are typically contracted on an annual basis 
customers with maintenance agreements receive software updates from us on an if and when available basis only 
foreign distributors generally provide customer training  service and support for the products they sell 
additionally  our products are supported internationally by distributors 
technical support is provided by telephone as well as by on site technical visits  if necessary 

table of contents we believe that as the installed base of our products grows and as customers purchase additional complementary products  revenue from professional services will increase and the software support function will become a larger source of recurring revenue 
maintenance and support service fees are deferred and recognized as income over the contract period on a straight line basis 
costs incurred by us to supply maintenance and support services are charged to cost of revenue as incurred 
research and development we develop software products internally and we also purchase or license rights to third party intellectual property 
we believe that our future success depends in part on our ability to maintain and improve our core technologies  enhance our existing products and develop new products that meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
internal research and development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the ability to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented to ensure the proper functioning of our software products 
we intend to expand our existing product offerings and introduce new mobile image processing software solutions that meet the needs of our customers 
we perform all quality assurance and develop documentation internally and strive to stay abreast of hardware advances that may affect our software design 
we intend to continue to support the major industry standard operating environments 
our team of specialists in recognition algorithms  software engineering  user interface design  product documentation and quality improvement is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the performance  quality and utility of all of our products 
in addition to research and development  our engineering staff provides customer technical support on an as needed basis along with technical sales support 
to improve the accuracy of our mobile image processing products  we devote significant research and development resources to enhance our core technology  including our extensive database of images that are used to train the neural network software that forms the core of our icr technology 
in addition  we have expanded our research and development tasks to include pre and post processing of data  when appropriate  to improve overall quality 
our research and development organization includes software engineers and scientists  many of whom have advanced degrees  as well as additional personnel in product management  quality assurance and client services 
we balance our engineering resources between the development of ocr icr  mobile image analytics technology and applications development 
all of our software engineers are involved in applications development  including ocr icr research and development of our mobile imaging platforms and products with solutions for mobile image and data capture  mobile check deposits  mobile bill payments  form identification  real time image quality analysis  fraud detection for signatures  quality assurance  and customer services and support 
our research and development expenses for the years ended september  and were  and  respectively 
we expect research and development expenses to increase during fiscal year as we continue to expand our research and new product development efforts 
employees and labor relations as of september   we had full time employees  consisting of eight in sales and marketing  in research and development  product management and support  and in executive  finance  network administration and other capacities 
in addition  we engaged various consultants in the areas of research and development  product development  finance and marketing during fiscal year we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors 
the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks associated with our business we have a history of losses and we may not achieve profitability in the future 
our operations resulted in a net loss of  and  for the years ended september  and  respectively 
we have a history of losses and may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of  our future profitability depends upon many factors  including several that are beyond our control 
these factors include  without limitation changes in the demand for our products and services  loss of key customers or contracts  the introduction of competitive software  the failure to gain market acceptance of our new and existing products  the failure to successfully and cost effectively develop  introduce and market new products  services and product enhancements in a timely manner  and the timing of recognition of revenue 
in addition  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses related to being a public company 
as a result of these expenditures  we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund continuing operations and an inability to raise the necessary capital or to do so on acceptable terms could threaten the success of our business 
we currently anticipate that our available capital resources  including our credit facility and operating cash flow  will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  such resources may not be sufficient to fund the long term growth of our business 
if we determine that it is necessary to raise additional funds  we may choose to do so through strategic collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private equity or debt financing  a bank line of credit  or other 
table of contents arrangements 
we cannot be sure that any additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity or equity related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our shares of common stock  and debt or equity financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs 
if we obtain funding through a strategic collaboration or licensing arrangement  we may be required to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
if we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations  we may be required to defer  reduce or eliminate certain planned expenditures or significantly curtail our operations 
we have a limited number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance and may need to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock in the future to fund continuing operations 
as of november   we had  authorized shares of common stock  of which  shares were either issued and outstanding  reserved for issuance under outstanding equity awards and warrants to purchase common stock or reserved for future issuance under existing equity plans 
therefore  we have a limited number of shares of common stock available for future issuance which may  should the need arise  hinder our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into  exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock to fund continuing operations  defend our intellectual property and pay obligations 
in the event that we need to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock to fund continuing operations  we will be required to further amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
any such amendment would require the approval of a majority of our issued and outstanding common stock 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the requisite vote to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock  should the need arise 
if we are unable to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock when needed  our ability to raise capital to fund continuing operations could be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited 
federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes as defined by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section 
under section  if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in its equity ownership over a three year period  the corporation s ability to use its pre change nol carryforwards and other pre change tax attributes to offset its post change income may be limited 
at september   we do not believe that any ownership change has occurred that would materially limit the utilization of nol carryforwards 
however  future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an ownership change 
if an ownership change does occur in the future  utilization of the nol carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from a single type of technology 
if this technology and the related products do not achieve or continue to achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we currently derive substantially all of our product revenues from licenses and sales of software products to customers incorporating our intelligent mobile imaging technology and software products 
if we are unable to achieve or continue to achieve market acceptance of our core technology or products incorporating such technology  we will not generate significant revenue growth from the sale of our products 
additionally  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for our products and services  such as competition from other products or technologies  any decline in the demand for mobile image processing  negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if economic or other factors negatively affect the small and medium sized business sector  our customers may become unwilling or unable to purchase our products and services  which could cause our revenue to decline 
many of our existing and target customers are in the small and medium sized business sector 
these businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger  more established businesses 
additionally  these customers often have limited discretionary funds  which they may choose to spend on items other than our products and services 
if small and medium sized businesses experience economic hardship  it could negatively affect the overall demand for our products and services  and could cause our revenue to decline 
we face competition from several companies that may have greater resources than we do  which could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
we compete against numerous companies in the mobile imaging software market 
competition in this market may increase as a result of a number of factors  such as the entrance of new or larger competitors or alternative technologies 
these competitors may have greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources  larger client bases and greater brand or name recognition than we do 
these competitors could  among other things announce new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing product offerings  force us to charge lower prices  or adversely affect our relationships with current clients 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors and if we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower our prices  our revenue  operating margins and market share could decline 
we must continue to engage in extensive research and development in order to remain competitive 
our ability to compete effectively with our mobile imaging software products depends upon our ability to meet changing market conditions and develop enhancements to our products on a timely basis in order to maintain our competitive advantage 
rapidly advancing technology and rapidly changing user preferences characterize the markets for products incorporating mobile imaging software technology and products 
our continued growth will ultimately depend upon our ability to develop additional technologies and attract strategic alliances for related or separate products 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements and additional technologies  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products  or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace  will be of acceptable quality  or will achieve market acceptance 
our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated greatly in the past and will likely continue to do so  which may cause substantial fluctuations in our common stock price 
our annual and quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly depending on factors including the timing of customer projects and purchase orders  new product announcements and releases by us and other companies  gain or loss of significant customers  price discounting of our products  the timing of expenditures  customer product delivery requirements  availability and cost of components or labor and economic conditions  generally  and in the information technology market  specifically 
revenues related to our licenses for mobile imaging software products are required to be recognized upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers and the timing of any re orders of additional licenses and or license renewals by our channel partners and customers 

table of contents in fiscal years and  sales of licenses to channel partners has comprised a significant part of our revenue 
this is attributable to the timing of the purchase or renewal of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any channel partner 
if we were to lose a channel partner relationship  we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell the previously purchased products to customers 
however  such a relationship could take time to develop  if it develops at all 
any unfavorable change in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for a particular quarter or year  which may cause downward pressure on our common stock price 
we expect quarterly and annual fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our historical order flow patterns  which we expect to continue  have caused forecasting difficulties for us 
if we do not meet our forecasts or analysts forecasts for us  the price of our common stock may decline 
historically  a significant portion of our sales have resulted from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter from orders received in the final month of the applicable quarter 
we do  however  base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  we expect our expense levels to be relatively fixed in the short term 
any concentration of sales at the end of the quarter may limit our ability to plan or adjust operating expenses 
therefore  if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur or are delayed  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of sales  and our operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not and will not necessarily be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
if our operating results for a quarter are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected 
defects or malfunctions in our products could hurt our reputation  sales and profitability 
our business and the level of customer acceptance of our products depend upon the continuous  effective and reliable operation of our products 
our products are extremely complex and are continually being modified and improved  and as such may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
to the extent that defects or errors cause our products to malfunction and our customers use of our products is interrupted  our reputation could suffer and our revenue could decline or be delayed while such defects are remedied 
we may also be subject to liability for the defects and malfunctions of third party technology partners and others with whom our products and services are integrated 
in addition  our products are typically intended for use in applications that are critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we believe that our customers and potential customers have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products in general 
there can be no assurance that  despite our testing  errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  adverse litigation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to our intellectual property if the patents we own or license  or our other intellectual property rights  do not adequately protect our technologies  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products  including mobile deposit 
we rely on trademark  trade secret  copyright and patent law  as well as a combination of non disclosure  confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology and rights 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any 
table of contents of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us 
the pto may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
we could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
our issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may expire or may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related technologies 
additionally  upon expiration of our issued or licensed patents  we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making  using  selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents 
we also must rely on contractual provisions with the third parties that license technology to us and that obligate these third parties to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us 
there is no guarantee that these third parties would be successful in attempting to protect our rights in any such licensed technology 
there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents or other intellectual property or any intellectual property or technology licensed to us 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
we seek to protect our know how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees  consultants  partners  and customers 
however  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information 
in addition  we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products 
common law trademarks provide less protection than registered trademarks 
loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries  our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us  which could adversely affect our competitive position  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims that we infringe upon the rights  or have otherwise utilized proprietary information  of third parties may give rise to costly and lengthy litigation  and we could be prevented from selling products  forced to pay damages  and defend against litigation 
in the past  third parties have asserted claims that certain technologies incorporated in our products infringe on their patent rights 
although we have resolved past claims  there is currently a claim pending against us by united services automobile association usaa that we have utilized their proprietary information in our patents and mobile deposit product  and there can be no assurance that we will not receive notices in the future from parties asserting  directly or indirectly through our customers  that our products infringe  or may infringe  on their intellectual property rights  or otherwise utilize their proprietary information 
if our technology and products are found to infringe upon or otherwise utilize the proprietary rights of other parties  we could incur substantial costs and we may have to obtain licenses  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us  expend significant resources to redesign our products or technology to avoid infringement  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  pay substantial damages  and defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose  and which could result in a substantial diversion of our valuable management resources 

table of contents furthermore  we may  as we have with usaa and top image systems ltd  initiate claims or litigation against parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation  either as plaintiff or defendant  could result in significant expense to us  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
as a result of a patent infringement or other intellectual property suit brought against us or our channel partners or licensees  we or our channel partners or licensees may be forced to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling technologies or potential products that are claimed to infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights unless that party grants us or our channel partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to develop some of our technologies or potential products or may have to discontinue development of a product candidate or cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement or other intellectual property claims  which could severely harm our business 
risks related to our operations if we are unable to retain and recruit qualified personnel  or if any of our key executives or key employees discontinues his or her employment with us  it may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are highly dependent on the key members of our management team and other key technical personnel 
if we were to lose the services of one or more of our key personnel  or if we failed to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  it could materially and adversely affect our customer relationships  competitive position and revenues 
furthermore  recruiting and retaining qualified highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing developments required to refine our technologies and to introduce future applications is critical to our success 
we may be unable to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition within the high technology industry 
we do not have any employment agreements providing for a specific term of employment with any member of our senior management 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our officers or employees 
we plan to grant stock options or other forms of equity awards in the future as a method of attracting and retaining employees  motivating performance and aligning the interests of employees with those of our stockholders 
as of november   we had  shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future grants of equity awards under our existing equity compensation plans  which will limit our ability to provide equity incentive awards to existing and future employees 
if we are unable to adopt  implement and maintain equity compensation arrangements that provide sufficient incentives  we may be unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates 
if we are unable to retain our existing employees  including qualified technical personnel  and attract additional qualified candidates  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
legislation and governmental regulations enacted in the us and other countries that apply to us or to our customers may require us to change our current products and services and or result in additional expenses  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislation and governmental regulations affect how our business is conducted  including changes in legislation and governmental regulations impacting financial institutions  insurance companies and mobile device companies 
globally  legislation and governmental regulations also influence our current and prospective customers activities  as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive  and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  further increasing the cost of compliance 
any such increase in costs as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers  delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions  cause us to change or limit our business practices or affect our financial condition and operating results 

table of contents compliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
in recent years  there have been several changes in laws  rules  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley and various other new regulations promulgated by the sec and rules promulgated by the national securities exchanges 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  expands federal regulation of corporate governance matters and imposes requirements on publicly held companies  including us  to  among other things  provide stockholders with a periodic advisory vote on executive compensation and also adds compensation committee reforms and enhanced pay for performance disclosures 
while some provisions of the dodd frank act are effective upon enactment  others will be implemented upon the sec s adoption of related rules and regulations 
the scope and timing of the adoption of such rules and regulations is uncertain and accordingly  the cost of compliance with the dodd frank act is also uncertain 
in addition  sarbanes oxley specifically requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of controls and procedures 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of sarbanes oxley act section  and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to our internal control over financial reporting 
our testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts 
we currently have limited internal audit capabilities and will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge 
moreover  if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline  and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
these and other new or changed laws  rules  regulations and standards are  or will be  subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
further  compliance with new and existing laws  rules  regulations and standards may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
members of our board of directors and our principal executive officer and principal financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and executive officers  which could harm our business 
we continually evaluate and monitor regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limits their liability  which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and or directors 
pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and as authorized under applicable delaware law  our directors and officers are not liable for monetary damages for breach of 
table of contents fiduciary duty  except for liability i for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders  ii for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  iii under section of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl  or iv for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit 
we have entered into a separate indemnification agreement the indemnification agreement with each of our directors 
under the indemnification agreement  each director is entitled to be indemnified against all expenses  judgments  penalties  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of such director in connection with any claims  proceedings or other actions brought against such director as a result of the director s service to us  provided that the director i acted in good faith  ii reasonably believed the action was in our best interest  and iii in criminal proceedings  reasonably believed the conduct was not unlawful 
additionally  the indemnification agreement entitles each director to contribution of expenses from us in any proceeding in which we are jointly liable with such director  but for which indemnification is not otherwise available 
the indemnification agreement also entitles each director to advancement of expenses incurred by such director in connection with any claim  proceeding or other action in advance of the final adjudication of any such claim  proceeding or other action  provided the director agrees to reimburse us for all such advances if it shall ultimately be determined that the director is not entitled to indemnification 
the foregoing limitations of liability and provisions for expenses may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and or directors 
from time to time our board of directors explores and considers strategic alternatives  including financings  strategic alliances  acquisitions  or the possible sale of the company 
our board of directors may not be able to identify or complete any suitable strategic alternatives and any such alternatives that are completed could have an impact on our operations or stock price 
from time to time our board of directors explores and considers potential strategic alternatives that may be available to us  including financings  strategic alliances  acquisitions  or the possible sale of the company 
we currently have no agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions  and we cannot assure you that our exploration of various strategic alternatives will result in any specific action or transaction 
if we determine to engage in a strategic transaction  we cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction might have on our operations or stock price 
we do not intend to provide updates or make further comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives  unless otherwise required by law 
risks related to our stock concentration of ownership among our existing directors and executive officers may limit an investor s ability to influence significant corporate decisions 
as of november  i the chairman of our board of directors and his spouse  who is also a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  and ii our directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under delaware law  these stockholders may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  and will have some control over our management and policies 
some of these persons may have interests that are different from yours 
for example  these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree 
the concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of the company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the company  which in turn could reduce the price of our stock 
in addition  these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office  delay or prevent changes in control of the company  or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval  such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions 

table of contents future sales of our stock  including those by our insiders  may cause our stock price to decline 
a significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers 
resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders  announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders  could adversely impact the market price of our stock 
some of our directors and executive officers have entered into rule b trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future 
actual or potential sales by these insiders  including those under a pre arranged rule b trading plan  could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the insider has lost confidence in our stock and adversely impact the market price of our stock 
we have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our equity plans under a registration statement on form s all shares issued pursuant to a registration statement on form s can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions on our affiliates under rule of the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
if a large number of these shares are sold in the public market  the sales could adversely impact the trading price of our stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market  and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock 
on november   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 which provides for the possible issuance of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants and units up to an aggregate amount of  and the resale of shares of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of  shares 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on march  sales of our common stock or other securities in the public market may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
these sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at prices you may deem acceptable 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company  prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to one million shares of blank check preferred stock 
as a result  without further stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of the dgcl 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
an interested stockholder is  generally  a stockholder who owns or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours who has owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years  subject to certain exceptions as described in the dgcl 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value

table of contents addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors 
some specific factors  in addition to the other risk factors identified above  that may have a significant effect on the price of our stock  many of which we cannot control  include but are not limited to our announcements or our competitors announcements of technological innovations  quarterly variations in operating results  changes in our product pricing policies or those of our competitors  claims of infringement of intellectual property rights or other litigation  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  changes in our growth rate or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors  our inability to raise additional capital as needed  changes in financial markets or general economic conditions  sales of stock by us or members of our management team or board of directors  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if our stock price appreciates in value 
we have never declared or paid a dividend on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which it was purchased

overview mitek systems  inc is engaged in the development  sale and service of its proprietary software solutions related to mobile imaging solutions and intelligent character recognition software 
we apply our patented technology in image capture  correction and intelligent data extraction in the mobile financial and business applications market 
our technology for extracting data from any image taken using camera equipped smartphones and tablets enables the development of consumer friendly software products that use the camera as a simple mechanism to enter data and complete transactions 
users take a picture of the document and our products correct image distortion  extract relevant data  route images to their desired location and process transactions through users financial institutions 
our mobile deposit product is software that allows users to remotely deposit a check using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet 
as of september   financial institutions  including of the top us retail banks and payment processing companies  have signed agreements to deploy our mobile deposit product 
of the financial institutions  have deployed our mobile deposit product with their customers 
other mobile imaging software solutions we offer include mobile photo bill pay  a mobile bill payment product that allows users to pay their bills using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet  mobile balance transfer  a product that allows credit card issuers to provide an offer to users and transfer an existing credit card balance by capturing an image of the user s current credit card statement  mobile enrollment  a product that enables users to enroll their checking account as a funding source for mobile payments by taking a photo of a blank check with their camera equipped smartphone or tablet  and mobile photo quoting  a product that enables users to receive insurance quotes by using their camera equipped smartphone or tablet to take a picture of their driver s license and insurance card 
our mobile imaging software solutions can be deployed on all major smartphone and tablet operating systems 
we market and sell our mobile imaging software solutions through channel partners or directly to enterprise customers and end users that typically purchase licenses based on the number of transactions or subscribers that use our mobile software 
our mobile imaging software solutions are often embedded in other mobile banking or enterprise applications developed by banks  insurance companies or their partners  and marketed under their own proprietary brands 
market opportunities  challenges and risks the acceptance of mobile banking by financial institutions and their customers has helped drive demand for our mobile imaging software products 
during fiscal year  a significant number of financial institutions deployed our mobile imaging software products  particularly mobile deposit  as part of their offering of mobile banking choices for their customers 
we believe that financial institutions see our patented solutions as a way to provide an all around better retail customer experience in mobile banking 
to continue the growth in market acceptance  we must continue to offer mobile imaging software products that address the growing market for mobile banking and mobile imaging solutions sold into other vertical

factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for our mobile applications  such as competition from other products or alternative technologies  any decline in the demand for mobile applications or negative publicity  or the obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate  could result in lower revenues or gross margins 
further  because most of our revenues are derived from a single type of technology  our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable to fluctuations in market demand and competition from alternative technologies  which could reduce our revenues 
the implementation cycles for our software products and services by our channel partners and customers can be lengthy  often a minimum of three to six months and sometimes longer for larger customers  subject to delays and require significant investments 
if implementation of our software products by our channel partners and customers are delayed or otherwise not completed  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we derive revenue predominately from the sale of software licenses to use the products covered by our patented technologies  such as mobile deposit  and to a lesser extent  by providing maintenance and professional services for the products we offer 
the revenue we derive from these software licenses is primarily derived from product sales to our channel partners 
revenues related to our licenses for mobile imaging software products are required to be recognized upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers and the timing of additional software licenses and or license renewals by our channel partners and customers 
during fiscal years and  sales of software licenses to channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each quarter 
this customer concentration is attributable to the timing of the purchase or renewal of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any channel partner 
if we were to lose a channel partner relationship  we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell the previously purchased products to customers 
however  such a relationship could take time to develop  if it develops at all 
our mobile imaging products address a new market for the use of camera equipped smartphone and tablets and therefore face emerging competition 
we believe our products are among the first smartphone and tablet solutions of their kind  but we anticipate growing competition as the market matures 
we intend to continue to further strengthen our software product portfolio through continued research and development to help us remain competitive 
we may have difficulty meeting changing market conditions and developing enhancements to our software applications on a timely basis in order to maintain our competitive advantage 
our continued growth will ultimately depend upon our ability to develop additional software products and attract strategic alliances that sell such technologies

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for accounts receivable  investments  fair value of equity instruments  accounting for income taxes and capitalized software development costs 
revenue recognition we enter into contractual arrangements with integrators  resellers and end users that may include licensing of our software products  product support and maintenance services  consulting services or various combinations thereof  including the sale of such products or services separately 
our accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements is fully described in note to our financial statements included in this form k 
we consider many factors when applying gaap to revenue recognition 
these factors include  but are not limited to  whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or performance of the service has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the contractual fee is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements or other appropriate method of revenue allocation exists 

table of contents each of the relevant factors is analyzed to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards  especially with respect to complex or new types of transactions  could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and operating results 
accounts receivable we consistently monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses that is based on historical experience and on specific customer collection issues 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our revenue recognition policy requires customers to be deemed creditworthy  our accounts receivable are based on customers whose payment is reasonably assured 
our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide variety of customers 
we do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
investments we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
in using this fair value hierarchy  management may be required to make assumptions about pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk  specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value 
these assumptions are subjective in nature and may significantly affect our results of operations 
fair value of equity instruments the valuation of certain items  including valuation of warrants  the beneficial conversion feature related to convertible debt and compensation expense related to stock options granted  involves significant estimates based on underlying assumptions made by management 
the valuation of warrants and stock options are based upon a black scholes valuation model  which involves estimates of stock volatility  expected life of the instruments and other assumptions 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we maintain 
table of contents a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the future realization based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
until such time as we can demonstrate that we will no longer incur losses or if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  we could be required to maintain the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
capitalized software development costs research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  the costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and changes in hardware and software technologies 
costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead 
no such costs were capitalized during the fiscal years ended september  and amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when product sales commence 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis on either the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years or the sales ratio method 
unamortized capitalized software development costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the product are expensed immediately
