item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview hb fuller company is a global formulator  manufacturer and marketer of adhesives and other specialty chemical products 
we are managed through six operating segments north america adhesives  construction products  eimea europe  india  middle east and africa  latin america adhesives  latin america paints and asia pacific 
north america adhesives  eimea  latin america adhesives and asia pacific operating segments manufacture and supply adhesives products in the assembly  packaging  converting  nonwoven and hygiene  performance wood  flooring  textile  flexible packaging  graphic arts and envelope markets 
construction products operating segment provides products  such as ceramic tile installation products and hvac sealants 
latin america paints operating segment manufactures and sells liquid paints primarily in central american countries 
total company when reviewing our financial statements  it is important to understand how certain external factors impact us 
these factors include changes in the prices of commodities  such as crude oil and natural gas global supply and demand of raw materials economic growth rates  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar we purchase thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of our cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  our financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from commodity prices  the supply and demand of raw materials also have a significant impact on our costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time 
we continually monitor capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect our raw materials 
in  we generated percent of our net revenue in the us and percent in eimea 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which we supply products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the overall economic activity 
in business components such as construction products and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  our revenues and costs increase as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar have the largest impact on our financial results as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a positive impact on net revenue of million as compared to key financial results and transactions for included the following net revenue increased percent from primarily driven by percent organic sales growth 
every five or six years we have a rd week in our fiscal year 
was a week year which contributed approximately percent to our net revenue 
gross profit margin decreased to percent from percent in and percent in mostly due to the increase in raw material costs 
cash flow generated from operating activities was million in as compared to million in and million in we repurchased the percent non controlling interest that sekisui chemical held in our china entities for million 
we acquired the principal assets and certain liabilities of liquamelt corp 
on april  for million 

table of contents the global economic conditions showed little or no improvement in our total year organic sales growth increased percent for compared to both our product pricing and sales volume increased in as compared to  however the increase in raw material costs contributed to a decrease in gross profit margin compared to in our diluted earnings per share increased to per share from per share in and per share in the most significant factors affecting results were the percent increase in net revenue and the continuing increase in raw material costs 
we incurred special charges in of million for costs related to the pending acquisition of the global industrial adhesives business of forbo group  the eimea operating segment transformation project and a foreign exchange option to hedge a portion of the acquisition price 
on an after tax basis  the special charges resulted in a million negative impact on net income and a negative effect on diluted earnings per share 
in we had exit costs and impairment charges to exit our polysulfide based insulating glass product line  which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
on an after tax basis  this was a negative million impact on net income and a negative effect on diluted earnings per share 
in we settled a lawsuit with the former owners of the roanoke companies group  a business we acquired in the settlement resulted in a pre tax gain of million which was million after tax or per diluted share 
in we continued to invest to make hb fuller a stronger company 
investments made in included additional resources in our sales and technical organizations  strengthening our management team  the construction of a manufacturing facility in india  the acquisition of liquamelt corp 
and the repurchase of the percent holding that sekisui chemical held in our china entities 
outlook for  we expect to capitalize on the investments we have made and we expect net revenue to continue to grow 
the coming quarters may prove to be difficult as economic activity remains uncertain 
we expect our cost of raw materials in to be similar to despite the continued high cost of raw materials  our gross margin should improve as we continue to manage pricing actions  reformulations and product substitutions 
we also expect operating expenses to be leveraged to enhance our operating margin in our capital spending plans for are higher than actual spending in previous years  reflecting our confidence in our business and the opportunities we see to improve the productivity of our business and our prospects for growth  especially in the emerging markets 
on december  we entered into an agreement to purchase the global industrial adhesives business of forbo group for approximately million 
in conjunction with the pending acquisition of forbo  we entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to purchase swiss francs 
prior to closing the acquisition transaction  we intend to raise permanent financing through the private placement and syndicated bank loan markets 
the transaction is expected to close as soon as march  we expect to incur additional non recurring costs associated with the proposed forbo acquisition and the eimea transformation project 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill impairment assessment  long lived assets recoverability  share based compensation accounting  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both the us and us entities 
also in the us we sponsor other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of assumptions employed in these measurements for both the non us and non us plans 

table of contents the discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial yield curve approach  which enables us to select a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan 
the approach identifies a broad universe of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan 
we use this approach rather than a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations 
the discount rate for the us pension plan was percent at december   as compared to percent at november  and percent at november  net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year 
a discount rate reduction of percentage points at december  would increase pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pre tax in fiscal discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets in the portfolio based on our investment strategy 
our current investment strategy for the us pension plan is to invest percent of the portfolio in equities and percent in fixed income securities 
the investment mix of assets as of december  was percent equities  percent fixed income securities and percent cash 
the investment mix of assets as of december  for our non us pension plans was percent equities  percent fixed income securities and percent cash 
during  we announced significant changes to our us pension plan the plan 
the changes included benefits under the plan were locked in using service and salary as of may   participants no longer earn benefits for future service and salary as they had in the past  affected participants receive a three percent increase to the locked in benefit for every year they continue to work for us and we are making a retirement contribution of three percent of eligible compensation to the k plan for those participants 
these changes to the plan represented a plan curtailment as there is no longer a service cost component in the net periodic pension cost as all participants are considered inactive in the plan 
in we elected to contribute million to the us pension plan for the purpose of restoring the asset values up to the level of the projected benefit obligations and to reduce net periodic benefit cost 
our investment strategy for the non us pension plans was also amended in to be more balanced between equities and fixed income securities 
for reasons similar to the us plan  we also contributed million to the german plan in the expected return on assets used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan was percent for  percent for and percent for for  the rate will remain percent 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million pre tax 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans is determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  we have used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent for goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition  and all the activities within a reporting unit are available to support the value of goodwill 
accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the estimated fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 

table of contents the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
the change in our operating segments in did not cause a reassessment of our goodwill impairment analysis as our reporting units remained the same 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
there were no indications of impairment 
of the goodwill balance of million as of december   million resides in the eimea operating segment and million resides in the north america adhesives operating segment 
in both of these operating segments  the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the net assets by a significant margin 
as of december  the goodwill balance in the asia pacific operating segment is million  construction products operating segment is million and latin america adhesives operating segment is million 
in all three of these operating segments the calculated fair value exceeded their carrying value by a reasonable margin 
if the economy or business environment falter  our projections used would need to be remeasured  which could impact the carrying value of our goodwill in one or more of our operating segments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects our assumptions and estimates 
factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by us included the expected useful lives of long lived assets 
the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
in we exited our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable and was therefore impaired 
we calculated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million to write down the value of amortizable intangible assets 
share based compensation we have granted stock options  restricted stock and deferred compensation awards to certain employees and non employee directors 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after december   and for all share based payments granted prior to december  but not yet vested as of december   in accordance with accounting standards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification tm asc and  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award normally the vesting period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes model to value our stock option awards 
we believe that future volatility will not materially differ from our historical volatility 
thus  we use the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment 
table of contents awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
reserves for loss contingencies associated with these matters are established when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability is probable but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued  and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
as of december   we have accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
we also have recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at our sorocaba  brazil facility as of december  a discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
as of december   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
we recognize tax benefits for tax positions for which it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we do not recognize a financial statement benefit for a tax position that does not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
it is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax position 
future changes in judgment related to the resolution of tax positions will impact earnings in the quarter of such change 
we adjust our income tax liabilities related to tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement with respect to a tax position would usually require cash 
based upon our analysis of tax positions taken on prior year returns and expected tax positions to be taken for the current year tax returns  we have identified gross uncertain tax positions of million as of december  we have not recorded us deferred income taxes for certain of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us should we change our business strategies related to these non us subsidiaries  additional us tax liabilities could be incurred 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of these additional tax liabilities

asset impairment charges in millions asset impairment charges during  we discontinued production of the polymer used in certain resin products that had been produced in our eimea operating segment 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of the trademarks and trade names used in these resin products was impaired 
we calculated the fair value using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million related to the impairment of trademarks and trade names used in the abandoned resin products 

table of contents in we exited our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable and was therefore impaired 
we calculated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million to write down the value of intangible assets

operating segment results through the first quarter of  we managed our business based on four primary geographic regions north america  eimea  latin america and asia pacific which were our reportable segments for sec disclosure purposes 
the change in our ceo at the end of fiscal resulted in a review of our management reporting structure 
changes in the reporting structure  during the second quarter of  required us to conduct an operating segment assessment in accordance with asc topic segment reporting  to determine our reportable segments 
the conclusion of the assessment is that we now have six reportable segments north america adhesives  construction products  eimea  latin america adhesives  latin america paints and asia pacific 
we are required to report segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources 
for segment evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  segment operating income is defined as gross profit less sg a expenses 
segment operating income excludes special charges and asset impairment charges 
inter segment revenues are recorded at cost plus a markup for administrative costs

table of contents the following tables provide details of north america adhesives net revenue variances vs vs organic growth currency total net revenue increased percent in compared to organic sales growth of percent was driven by increased average selling prices offset by lower sales volume compared to last year 
the extra week added approximately percent to the net revenue as compared to raw material costs continued to increase as the global demand for feedstocks which are the basis of many of our raw materials  continued to increase 
this resulted in a significant increase in our raw material costs in despite implementing selling price increases and reducing manufacturing expenses  we have not been able to completely offset the rising raw material costs

segment operating income as a percent of net revenue was percent in compared to percent in net revenue increased percent in compared to organic sales growth was percent compared to resulting from increases in both sales volumes and average selling prices 
the sales volume increased as a result of a stronger economy in compared to a recession burdened and new business won in the year 
the average selling prices increased as a result of pricing actions taken during raw material shortages and corresponding price hikes throughout caused an increase in raw material costs and a decline in gross profit margins in as compared to sg a expense as a percent of net revenue was relatively flat year over year which contributed to the percent increase in segment operating income in as compared to segment operating income as a percent of net revenue was percent in compared to percent in construction products in millions vs vs net revenue segment operating income segment profit margin the following tables provide details of construction products net revenue variances vs vs organic growth net revenue increased percent in compared to due to sales increases in the retail and distribution channels 
higher sales volume and to a lesser extent higher average selling price drove the increase in net revenue compared to the prior year 
the extra week added approximately percent to the net revenue as compared to selling price increases were not enough to completely offset the increases in raw material costs and as a result our gross profit margins declined slightly in compared to sg a expenses increased in as compared to but at a lower percentage rate than the increase in net revenue 
net revenue growth was the primary driver of the percent increase in segment operating income in compared to segment operating income as a percent of net revenue was percent in compared to percent in the percent increase in net revenue in compared to was driven by increased sales volume from the stabilizing economy and new business  especially in our retail products

total return is calculated using trailing month information 
total invested capital is defined as the sum of notes payable  current maturities of long term debt  long term debt  redeemable non controlling interest and total equity 
roic was introduced because we believe it provides a true measure of return on capital invested 
we believe it is an effective way to internally measure performance and it is focused on the long term 
the roic calculated at december  was percent and at november  was percent

forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could including the negative or variations thereof and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  our plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  item a 
risk factors identifies some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our 
table of contents actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the list of important factors in item a 
risk factors does not necessarily present in order of importance 
this disclosure  including that under forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time  represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given 
we do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the sec or in our press releases on related subjects 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions 
continued or further recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to a recession in the domestic and international economies  or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
we believe that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on interest expense of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million or per diluted share 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial condition 
approximately percent of net revenue was generated outside of the united states in principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound sterling  japanese yen  swiss franc  argentine peso  brazilian real  chilean peso  colombian peso  costa rican colon  chinese renminbi  honduran lempira  indian rupee and mexican peso 
our objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
we enter into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
we take steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results and foreign currency balance sheet positions as of december   a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
we generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  unplanned supplier production outages may lead to strained supply demand situations for several key raw materials such as ethylene and propylene  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
the purchase of raw materials is our largest expenditure 
our objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both our quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
