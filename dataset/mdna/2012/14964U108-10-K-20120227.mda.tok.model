for a complete discussion on our acquisitions from through  see note business combinations in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
since inception  we have invested heavily in new product development and our net revenue has grown from million in to million in driven primarily by demand in the enterprise network and data center markets and increased demand in the broadband and consumer markets 
we expect sales of our products for use in the enterprise network and data center markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future  however  we do expect growth in the broadband and consumer as well as the access and servicer provider markets 
we primarily sell our products to oems  either directly or through their contract manufacturers 
contract manufacturers purchase our products only when an oem incorporates our product into the oem s product  not as commercial off the shelf products 
our customers products are complex and require significant time to define  design and ramp to volume production 
accordingly  our sales cycle is long 
this cycle begins with our 
table of contents technical marketing  sales and field application engineers engaging with our customers system designers and management  which is typically a multi month process 
if we are successful  a customer will decide to incorporate our product in its product  which we refer to as a design win 
because the sales cycles for our products are long  we incur expenses to develop and sell our products  regardless of whether we achieve the design win and well in advance of generating revenue  if any  from those expenditures 
we do not have long term purchase commitments from any of our customers  as sales of our products are generally made under individual purchase orders 
however  once one of our products is incorporated into a customer s design  it is likely to remain designed in for the life cycle of the product 
we believe this to be the case because a redesign would generally be time consuming and expensive 
we have experienced revenue growth due to an increase in the number of our products  an expansion of our customer base  an increase in the number of average design wins within any one customer and an increase in the average revenue per design win 
our revenue from montavista is mainly from sale of software subscriptions of embedded linux operating system  related development tools  support and professional services 
the net revenue for our software and services are primarily derived from the sale of time based software licenses  software maintenance and support  and from professional services arrangements and training 
key business metrics design wins 
we closely monitor design wins by customer and end market on a periodic basis 
we consider design wins to be a key ingredient in our future success  although the revenue generated by each design win can vary significantly 
our long term sales expectations are based on internal forecasts from specific customer design wins based upon the expected time to market for end customer products deploying our products and associated revenue potential 
pricing and margins 
pricing and margins depend on the features of the products we provide to our customers 
in general  products with more complex configurations and higher performance tend to be priced higher and have higher gross margins 
these configurations tend to be used in high performance applications that are focused on the enterprise network  data center  and access and service provider markets 
we tend to experience price decreases over the life cycle of our products  which can vary by market and application 
in general  we experience less pricing volatility with customers that sell to the enterprise and data center markets 
sales volume 
a typical design win can generate a wide range of sales volumes for our products  depending on the end market demand for our customers products 
this can depend on several factors  including the reputation  market penetration  the size of the end market that the product addresses  and the marketing and sales effectiveness of our customer 
in general  our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend to develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle 
in addition  some markets generate large volumes if the end market product is adopted by the mass market 
customer product life cycle 
we typically commence commercial shipments from nine months to three years following a design win 
once our product is in production  revenue from a particular customer may continue for several years 
we estimate our customers product life cycles based on the customer  type of product and end market 
in general  products that go into the enterprise network and data center take longer to reach volume production but tend to have longer lives 
products for other markets  such as broadband and consumer  tend to ramp relatively quickly  but generally have shorter life cycles 
we estimate these life cycles based on our management s experience with providers of networking equipment and the semiconductor market as a whole 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and 
table of contents judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if the changes in estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  mask costs  business combinations  and goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products and sales of software licenses and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of a binding arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is deemed fixed and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is probable 
our price is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices  which is often memorialized with a customer purchase order 
our agreements with non distributor customers do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and any past transaction history of the customers 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of revenue 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment to our customers 
revenue from the sales of semiconductor products consists of sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to networking original equipment manufacturers  or oems  their contract manufacturers or distributors 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing and their contract manufacturers purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors 
revenue is recognized upon shipment for sales to distributors with limited rights of returns and price protection if we conclude we can reasonably estimate the credits for returns and price adjustments issuable 
we record an estimated allowance  at the time of shipment  based on our historical patterns of returns and pricing credits of sales recognized upon shipment 
the credits issued to distributors or other customers have historically not been material 
the inventory at these distributors at end of the period may fluctuate from time to time mainly due to the oem production ramps or new customer demands 

table of contents revenue and costs relating to sales to distributors are deferred if we grant more than limited rights of returns and price credits or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of returns and credits issuable 
deferred margin on these shipments is reported and are included in deferred revenue and accounts receivable is recognized and inventory is relieved when title of inventories transfers  which typically takes place at the time of shipment  which is the point in time at which we have a legal enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms 
we also derive revenue from licensing software and providing software maintenance and support 
software arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products for a specified period of time  generally months time based license  and ii a support arrangement that provides for technical support and unspecified product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis over the period of the related license 
revenue from software and service arrangements is recorded when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require either a written contract signed by both the customer and us  or a shrink wrap or click through contract whereby the customer agrees to our standard license terms  together with a non cancellable purchase order  or a purchase order from these customers that have previously negotiated an end user license arrangement or volume purchase arrangement 
delivery has occurred we deliver software to our customers electronically and consider delivery to have occurred once the access codes are provided that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 
the fee is fixed or determinable our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
collectibility is probable we assess the collectibility of an arrangement on a case by case basis  based on the financial condition of the customer as well as any established payment history 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to the adoption of the amended guidance on multiple delivery arrangements effective january   which contain software or software related elements 
we allocate revenue between elements in a multiple element revenue arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for each undelivered element 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
we enter into multiple element arrangements that generally include time based licenses and support that are typically not sold separately 
revenue from these arrangements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term that support is offered  which is typically months 
the software arrangement may also include professional services  and these services may be purchased separately 
professional services engagements are billed on either a fixed fee or time and materials basis 
for fixed fee arrangements  professional services revenue is recognized under the proportional performance method  with the associated costs included in cost of revenue 
we estimate the proportional performance of the arrangements based on an analysis of progress toward completion 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate  and a loss is recognized when the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenue 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on progress toward completion of projects in progress 
to the extent we are unable to estimate the proportional performance then the revenue is recognized on a completed performance basis 
revenue for time and materials engagements is recognized as the effort is incurred 
in addition  we also enter into multiple element arrangements  which consist of the combination of licensed software  support and professional services 
professional services in these arrangements do not involve significant customization  modification or development of software licensed under the time based licenses and 
table of contents are not essential to the functionality of these software 
provided that the total arrangement consideration is fixed and determinable at the inception of the arrangement  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to professional services and time based licenses bundled with support based on vsoe for professional services and vsoe for time based licenses bundled with support 
each unit of accounting is then accounted for under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using the proportional performance method 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for each undelivered element of the arrangement  revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred until the time that we are able to establish vsoe for the undelivered elements or there is only one remaining undelivered element 
when the revenue is deferred  the direct costs incurred in relation to the professional services arrangement are deferred and are recorded as deferred costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
effective january   we adopted the updated guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of this updated guidance  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements with combinations of hardware  software  post contract support and or professional services  and if the different elements in the arrangement qualify as separate units of accounting  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each element based on relative selling price 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for products and services revenue recognition 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
tpe is determined by evaluating competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our product offerings related to these arrangements contain a significant level of customization and contain a significant portion of proprietary technology which are not exactly comparable to its peers  therefore pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained  and thus we cannot determine tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
the esp is determined by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels  gross margin objectives  internal costs  competitor pricing strategies  and industry technology lifecycles 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value recognition provisions of stock based compensation 
the stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  which require various subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility based on the historical stock price volatility of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of our stock based awards 
we use the simplified method as permitted under the provisions of stock based compensation to determine the expected term of our share based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates and judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
inventory valuation inventory is carried at cost except where we make provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on its age and forecasted demand  generally over a month period 
demand is impacted by market and economic 
table of contents conditions  technology changes  new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require management to make estimates that may include uncertain elements 
if actual market conditions or demand for our products are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when these write downs are recorded 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states federal tax jurisdiction 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related penalties and interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
mask costs we incur costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture wafers that incorporate our products 
we capitalize the costs of fabrication masks that are reasonably expected to be used during production manufacturing 
these amounts are included within property and equipment and are generally depreciated over a period of months to cost of revenue 
if we do not reasonably expect to use the fabrication mask during production manufacturing  the related mask costs are expensed to research and development in the period in which the costs are incurred 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
we determine the recognition of intangible assets based on the following criteria i the intangible asset arises from contractual or other rights  or ii the intangible is separable or divisible from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  returned or exchanged 
in accordance with the guidance provided under business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of business combinations to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
management makes valuation assumptions that require significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  and distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products  estimated cash flows from projects when completed and discount rates 
we estimate fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the updated authoritative guidance on business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
it also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and the financial effects of the business combination 
the updated guidance also provides guidance for recognizing changes in an acquirer s existing income tax valuation allowances and tax uncertainty accruals that result from a business combination transaction as adjustments to income tax expense 
similarly  under the updated guidance  we expensed related transaction costs of million  million and  in  and  respectively  associated with the acquisitions  which would have been capitalized under the prior accounting standards 
the updated guidance also addresses application issues regarding the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting of disclosures of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combination 
in circumstances where the acquisition date fair value for a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period and it is concluded that it is probable that an asset or liability exists as of the acquisition date and the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  a contingency is recognized as of the acquisition date based on the estimated amount 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
we review goodwill and finite lived purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value not recoverable 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the calendar year regardless if there is evidence of impairment 
we perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit 
a two step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit and intangible asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
the goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge during the years ended december   and for purposes of step one analyses for our annual goodwill impairment test  the fair value of each reporting unit was determined based on the weighted fair value using market and income approach 
determining the fair value of each reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value under the income approach include the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
the market approach utilized valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from comparable companies in the industry 
the result of the impairment analysis showed that the estimated fair value of the semiconductor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with a significant headroom  while for software and services reporting unit  the estimated fair value exceeded by approximately 
we continue to monitor the impact of recent market and economic events to determine if impairment indicators exist 
should a triggering event occur in  we will perform an interim impairment test 
certain estimates of discounted cash flows involves businesses with limited financial history and with developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 

table of contents in addition to the goodwill impairment  we also perform an impairment review of finite lived intangibles for the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of the assets if there are indicators of impairment 
if the carrying value or the remaining useful life of the intangible assets or asset group is not recoverable  we record a charge equal to the difference between carrying and fair value of the asset or asset group 
significant management judgment is required in the grouping of long lived assets and forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and finite lived intangible assets 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we wrote off acquired ipr d amounting to million as a result of the abandonment of certain research and development projects 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge to write down certain acquired intangible assets of million 
we did not have impairment of the carrying value of our long lived assets during the years ended december  and results of operations our revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december   and were year ended december  in thousands net revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin net revenue 
our net revenue consists primarily of sales of our semiconductor products to providers of networking equipment and their contract manufacturers and distributors 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to providers of networking equipment as they design and develop their product 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and periodically reduce the price of our products  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
we do not experience different margins on direct sales to providers of networking equipment and indirect sales through contract manufacturers because in all cases we negotiate product pricing directly with the providers of networking equipment 
to date  most of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
our end customers representing greater than of consolidated net revenue for each of the years ended were year ended december  percentage of total net revenue cisco actiontec represents less than of consolidated net revenue revenue and costs relating to sales to distributors are deferred if we grant more than limited rights of returns and price credits or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of returns and credits issuable 
during the quarter ended june   we signed a distribution agreement with avnet to distribute our products primarily in the united states 
given the terms of the distribution agreement  for sales to avnet  revenue and costs are deferred until products are sold by avnet to their end customers 
for the years ended december   and   and of our net revenues were from products sold by avnet  respectively 
revenue recognition depends on notification from avnet that product has been sold to avnet s end customers 

table of contents our distributors  other than avnet are used primarily to support international sale logistics in asia  including importation and credit management 
total net revenue through such distributors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which accounted for  and of net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the inventory at these distributors at the end of the period may fluctuate from time to time mainly due to the oem production ramps or new customer demands 
while we have purchase agreements with our distributors  the distributors do not have long term contracts with any of the equipment providers 
our distributor agreements limit the distributor s ability to return product up to a portion of purchases in the preceding quarter 
given our experience  along with our distributors limited contractual return rights  we believe we can reasonably estimate expected returns from our distributors 
accordingly  we recognize sales through distributors at the time of shipment  reduced by our estimate of expected returns 
revenue derived from licensing software and providing software maintenance  support and training amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue from professional service arrangements amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table is based on the geographic location of the original equipment manufacturers or the distributors who purchased our products 
for sales to our distributors  their geographic location may be different from the geographic locations of the ultimate end customers 
sales by geography for the periods indicated were year ended december  in thousands united states china taiwan japan malaysia other countries total cost of revenue and gross margin 
we outsource wafer fabrication  assembly and test functions of our products 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for assembly and test services  amortization of acquired intangibles and amortization related to capitalized mask costs 
to a lesser extent  cost of revenue includes expenses relating to our internal operations that manage our contractors  stock based compensation  the cost of shipping and logistics  royalties  inventory valuation expenses for excess and obsolete inventories  warranty costs and changes in product cost due to changes in sort  assembly and test yields 
in general  our cost of revenue associated with a particular product declines over time as a result of yield improvements  primarily associated with design and test enhancements 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors  which are primarily located in asia  to manufacture  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
we purchase processed wafers on a per wafer basis from our fabrication suppliers  which are currently tsmc  samsung  fujitsu and umc 
we also outsource the sort  assembly  final testing and other processing of our product to third party contractors  primarily ase and ise 
we negotiate wafer fabrication on a purchase order basis and do not have long term agreements with any of our third party contractors 
a significant disruption in the operations of one or more of these contractors would impact the production of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of revenue also includes amortized costs of certain identifiable intangible assets from our business acquisitions to the extent those identifiable intangible assets are directly associated with cost of revenue 
the 
table of contents total amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from business acquisitions included in cost of revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also incur costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture wafers that incorporate our products 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and  of mask costs  respectively 
as our product processes continue to mature and as we develop more history and experience  we expect to capitalize most or all of our mask costs in the future 
we amortize the cost of fabrication masks that we reasonably expect to use for production manufacturing generally over a month period 
total amortized expenses for the masks included in cost of revenue were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unamortized balance of capitalized mask costs at december  and was million and million  respectively 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the product mix  average sales prices of our products  the amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets  the timing of cost reductions for fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs  inventory valuation charges  the cost of fabrication masks that are capitalized and amortized  and the timing and changes in sort  assembly and test yields 
overall gross margin is impacted by the mix between higher performance  higher margin products and services and lower performance  lower margin products and services 
in addition  we typically experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products  which improve as production volumes increase 
research and development expenses

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters in the periods ended december  and the quarterly data have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements 
you should read this information together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we anticipate that the rate of new sales orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
in addition  because of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenue and operating results  including gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
although we have experienced significant percentage growth in revenue  we do not believe that our historical growth rates are necessarily indicative of future growth

cash equivalents consist primarily of an investment in a money market fund 
we believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents at december  and expected cash flow from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our engineering  sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
although we currently are not a party to any agreement with respect to potential material investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  other than disclosed in note  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
indemnities in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into agreements with customers that include indemnity provisions 
based on historical experience and information known as of december   we believe our exposure related to the above indemnities at december  is not material 
we also enter into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include similar indemnification obligations to our officers and directors 
it is not possible to determine the amount of our liability related to these indemnification agreements and obligations to our officers and directors due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented  we did not have  nor do we currently have  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total the increase in our operating lease obligations as of december  compared to december  was mainly due to the new operating lease of our new principal office which was signed on march  as of december   we had  of accrued liabilities from uncertain tax positions and related interest that could result in an additional tax assessment if successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
accordingly  the timing of payment cannot be estimated 
we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations to occur within the next months 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  are either not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
recent accounting pronouncements see recent accounting pronouncements in note organization and significant accounting policies in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
we therefore have minimal foreign currency risk associated with sale of products 
our international sales and marketing and research and development operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  however  we do not consider this currency risk to be material as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total spending 
we outsource our wafer fabrication  assembly  testing  warehousing and shipping operations  however  all expenses related thereto are denominated in united states dollars 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively  which was held for working capital purposes 
our cash equivalents at december  and consisted primarily of investments in a money market fund 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates due to their short term nature 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
