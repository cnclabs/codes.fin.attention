item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate profile and overview landmark bancorp  inc is a one bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and is engaged in the banking business through its wholly owned subsidiary  landmark national bank 
landmark bancorp is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol lark 
landmark national bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to its local communities 
our strategy includes continuing a tradition of quality assets while growing our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
we are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers and providing a total banking service 
landmark national bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits  together with borrowings and other funds  to originate one to four family residential real estate  construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial  agriculture  municipal and consumer loans 
although not our primary business function  we do invest in certain investment and mortgage related securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources 
our results of operations depend generally on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
while net interest income has remained relatively flat for the past three years  our results have been affected by certain non interest related items  including variances in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest earning assets mature or reprice at different times  or at different speeds  than our interest bearing liabilities 
our results of operations are also affected by non interest income  such as service charges  loan fees and gains from the sale of newly originated loans and gains or losses on investments 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  professional fees  federal deposit insurance costs  data processing expenses and provision for loan losses 
we are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial institutions 
deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments  the level of income and the personal rate of savings within our market areas 
factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions 
currently  our business consists of ownership of landmark national bank  with its main office in manhattan  kansas and twenty branch offices in eastern  central and southwestern kansas 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase a bank in wellsville  kansas with approximately million in deposits and million in loans  which will be merged into landmark national bank upon the anticipated closing of the acquisition during second quarter of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of real estate owned  the valuation of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which involve significant judgment by our management 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our lending portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
while these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining allowance requirements  actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results 
additional explanation of the methodologies used in establishing this allowance are provided in the asset quality and distribution section 
assets acquired through  or in lieu of  foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at the date of foreclosure at fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs through a gain or a charge to the allowance for loan losses  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  the company records a charge to earnings if the carrying value of a property exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell 
revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent declines in fair value are included in other non interest expense in the statement of earnings 
the company has classified its investment securities portfolio as available for sale  with the exception of certain investments held for regulatory purposes 
the company carries its available for sale investment securities at fair value and employs valuation techniques which utilize quoted prices or observable inputs when those inputs are available 
these observable inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the security  developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
when such information is not available  the company employs valuation techniques which utilize unobservable inputs  or those which reflect the company s own assumptions  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
these valuation methods typically involve estimated cash flows and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  estimates  or other inputs to the valuation techniques could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements are classified as level quoted prices  level based on observable inputs or level based on unobservable inputs 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of taxes  until realized 
purchase premiums and discounts on investment securities are amortized accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the securities using the interest method 
realized gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities are recorded on a trade date basis and are calculated using the specific identification method 
the company performs quarterly reviews of the investment portfolio to determine if any investment securities have any declines in fair value which might be considered other than temporary 
the initial review begins with all securities in an unrealized loss position 
the company s assessment of other than temporary impairment is based on its judgment of the specific facts and circumstances impacting each individual security at the time such assessments are made 
the company reviews and considers factual information  including expected cash flows  the structure of the security  the credit quality of the underlying assets and the current and anticipated market conditions 
credit related impairments on debt securities are recorded through a charge to earnings 
if an equity security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired  the entire impairment is recorded through a charge to earnings 
we have completed several business and asset acquisitions  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by our management 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets 
performing discounted cash flow analyses involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
useful lives are based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including the historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  we have identified purchase accounting  and the subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  as a critical accounting policy 
goodwill is not amortized  however  it is tested for impairment at each calendar year end or more frequently when events or circumstances dictate 
the impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill to an implied fair value of the goodwill  which is based on a review of the company s market capitalization adjusted for appropriate control premiums as well as an analysis of valuation multiples of recent  comparable acquisitions 
the company considers the result from each of these valuation methods to determine the implied fair value of its goodwill 
a goodwill impairment would be recorded for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
the company performed a step one impairment test as of december  by comparing the implied fair value of the company s single reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using observable market data  including the company s market capitalization  with control premiums and valuation multiples  compared to recent financial industry acquisition multiples for similar institutions to estimate the fair value of the company s single reporting unit 
the company s step one impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
the company can make no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in goodwill impairments 
intangible assets include core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights 
core deposit intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of ten years on an accelerated basis 
when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment  the company will evaluate the recoverability of the intangible asset carrying value  using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value 
mortgage servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets  primarily one to four family real estate loans 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized into non interest expense in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value  and are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the retained rights as compared to amortized cost 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
the company recognizes an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon irs examination  based upon its technical merits 
once that standard is met  the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the company assesses it deferred tax assets to determine if the items are more likely than not to be realized and a valuation allowance is established for any amounts that are not more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates regarding the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including the effects of irs examinations and examinations by other state agencies  could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for increased million  or  to million as compared to the improvement in net earnings was primarily the result of a million decrease in our provision for loan losses 
also contributing to the increased net earnings was a  decline in non interest expense 
partially offsetting those items were declines of  in non interest income   in net interest income and  in investment securities gains 
our provision for loan losses decreased to million in from million in due to improvements in our asset quality  as demonstrated through lower levels of non performing loans and reduced charge offs 
our non interest income declined as a result of lower gains on sales of loans as the volume of loans sold in the secondary market declined in relative to as well as a higher mortgage repurchase reserve provision recorded in than net interest income for decreased slightly to million  or lower than our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased slightly from during to in average interest earning assets declined slightly from million during to million for the decrease in net interest income and net interest margin was primarily a result of our interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing lower in the current rate environment 
during  we experienced a decline in the yields on our investment securities and loan portfolio which was not completely offset by lower rates on our deposits and borrowings 
in addition  we maintained higher average balances of investment securities during and lower average balances of loans 
our investments balances increased as we invested excess liquidity from higher deposit and lower loan balances 
the decline in our average loan balances was the result of multiple factors  including our decision to reduce exposure to construction and land loans  reduced loan demand from our customers 
it is unlikely that we will be able to increase our net interest margin from current levels in the near term and may see a decline as we currently expect to reinvest our future cash flows into lower yielding investments and we may not be able to renew our current loans at the same rates 
we distributed a stock dividend for the eleventh consecutive year in december all per share and average share data in this section reflect the and stock dividends 
interest income 
interest income for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for  due to lower average balances  which decreased from million in to million in  and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on loans from during to during interest income on investment securities increased  or  to million for due to higher average balances 
average investment securities increased from million for  to million for  while the average tax equivalent yield on our investment securities decreased from during to during the yield on our investment securities declined as a result of reinvesting the portfolio s cash flows into lower yielding investment securities in the current low interest rate environment 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million to million  or  from million in  primarily as a result of lower rates on our maturing certificates of deposit and lower rates on savings  money market and now accounts 
our total cost of deposits declined from during to during while our average interest bearing deposit balances increased from million in to million in the low interest rate environment has allowed us to reduce the rates paid on savings  money market and now accounts while generally maintaining our balances 
our higher cost certificate of deposit balances declined during as we priced our offering rates on new or maturing certificates of deposit to reflect the continued reduction in market rates 
average certificate of deposit balances declined from million in to million in during  interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  due to lower rates and average outstanding borrowings 
our cost of borrowing declined from in to in  while our average outstanding borrowings declined from million during to million during net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income derived from interest earning assets and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earnings assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread as well as the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for decreased  to million  while our net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased  over the same periods 
our net interest margin decreased from for to for the decrease in net interest income and net interest margin was primarily a result of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing lower in the current rate environment 
during  we experienced a decline in the yields on our investment securities and loan portfolio which was not completely offset by lower rates on our deposits and borrowings 
in addition  we maintained higher average balances of investment securities and lower average balances of loans during provision for loan losses 
we maintain  and our board of directors monitors  an allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance is established based upon management s periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  review of significant individual loans and collateral  review of delinquent loans  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  current and expected market conditions  and other factors management deems important 
determining the appropriate level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan portfolio and the collateral value of specifically identified problem loans 
additionally  allowance strategies and policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors  including current market conditions  actual loss experience and management s expectations 
our provision for loan losses declined from million during to million during the provision for loan losses declined due to improvements in our asset quality  as evidenced by our lower levels of non performing loans and decreased loan charge offs 
during  we had net loan charge offs of million compared to million during the increased net loan charge offs in were primarily related to a previously identified and impaired construction loan totaling million  which experienced a significant decline in the appraised value of the collateral securing the loan 
during  we charged the loan down million due to the decline in value of the collateral 
although legal efforts to collect payment from the guarantor continue  we charged off the remaining million balance on this loan during due to additional delays associated with the litigation 
also during  we charged off the remaining million balance on a commercial agriculture loan after exhausting our collection attempts 
the remaining loan charge offs during were principally associated with a previously identified and impaired commercial relationship consisting of million in real estate and operating loans  which was charged down to estimated fair value after we acquired ownership of the property securing the loans during the commercial real estate property was sold during without incurring any further losses 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  refer to the asset quality and distribution section 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  or  for  to million  as compared to million in the decline in non interest income was the result of a  decline in gains on sales of loans as our volume of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market was lower in as compared as well as a higher mortgage repurchase reserve provision recorded in than partially offsetting the lower gains on sales of loans were increases of  in fees and service charges   in other non interest income and  in bank owned life insurance income 
our fees and service charges increased as a result of a higher volume of fees and service charges received on our deposit accounts and increased servicing fee income 
during  we introduced a rewards program for our deposit customers that promoted debit card usage and other customer activity which generated additional non interest income 
we anticipate our rewards program will offset some of the reductions in future non interest income projected as a result of recent changes in debit card and overdraft regulations 
other non interest income increased primarily as a result of gains on sales of other real estate while our bank owned life insurance income increased as a result of purchasing million in additional life insurance policies in january investment securities gains losses 
during  we recognized  in gains on sales of investment securities as a result of selling approximately million of short term  tax exempt municipal investment securities and reinvesting the proceeds in longer term  tax exempt municipal investment securities as we capitalized on the steepness of the municipal yield curve 
partially offsetting the gains was  of other than temporary impairment losses that we recorded on common stock investment securities during during  we realized  of gains on sales of investment securities resulting from the sale of million of high quality mortgage backed investment securities  as we capitalized on what we believed to be premium pricing that existed in the markets for these types of securities at the time 
also during  we recorded a credit related  other than temporary impairment loss of  for the remaining cost basis of one of our three investments in pooled trust preferred investment securities in addition to a  other than temporary impairment loss on a common stock investment 
non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased  or  to million during the decrease in non interest expense was primarily driven by a  decline in federal deposit insurance premiums due to lower assessment rates beginning in the second quarter of  as well as decreases of  in data processing   in foreclosure and real estate owned expenses   in compensation and benefits and  in advertising 
our data processing costs declined as a result of renewing our contract at lower rates  while our foreclosure and real estate owned expense declined as a result of lower foreclosure related costs 
our compensation and benefits declined as a result of fewer employees and the reduction in advertising expense was part of a change in our marketing strategy 
those lower expenses were almost offset by the  increase in professional fees  primarily related to consultants who were engaged to help us review internal processes and procedures to identify opportunities to improve financial performance 
income taxes 
during  we recorded income tax expense of  an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of  in the higher effective tax rate in was driven by an increase in taxable income compared to  while tax exempt investment income and bank owned life insurance income remained similar between the years 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased million  or  to million as compared to the decline in earnings was primarily the result of a million increase in our provision for loan losses and a million increase in non interest expenses 
partially offsetting the higher expense was a favorable change of million in our net gains and losses on investment securities and a  increase in our non interest income 
our provision for loan losses increased to million in as compared to million in the provision for loan losses reflected the increased charge offs that occurred in  primarily related to a significant decline in appraised value of the collateral securing a previously identified and impaired construction loan 
the increased non interest expense was primarily related to a  increase in our foreclosure and other real estate expense as a result of provisions to record valuation allowances to reflect declines in the fair value of certain real estate owned assets  as well as higher compensation and benefits  professional fees and advertising expenses 
we recorded credit related  other than temporary impairment losses on our investment securities portfolio during both and  but the net impairment loss declined from  during to  during also  we realized a  gain on the sale of investments in due to the sale of a portion of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio  compared to a gain of only  during our increased non interest income in was a result of higher gains on sales of loans and higher fees and service charges 
our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased from for to for the increase in net interest margin was primarily a result of maintaining the yields on our loan portfolio while our deposits and fhlb advances repriced lower 
while our net interest margin increased  our average interest earning asset balances declined over the same periods 
the decline in average interest earning assets was a result of a decline in our outstanding loan balances and our decision not to reinvest excess liquidity into lower yielding investments and instead reducing higher cost liabilities 
the decline in our loan balances was the result of multiple factors  including our decision to reduce exposure to construction and land loans  reduced loan demand from our customers  increased loan charge offs and normal run off in our one to four family residential real estate loans 
interest income 
interest income for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decline in interest income was primarily the result of a decline in average interest earning assets and lower yields on our investment securities as a result of reinvesting the portfolio s cash flows into the lower yielding investment securities that were available in the lower interest rate environment of interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for  due to lower average balances  which decreased from million in to million in and to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on loans from during to during interest income on investment securities decreased million  or  to million for due to lower yields and average balances 
the average tax equivalent yield on our investment securities decreased from during to during average investment securities decreased from million for  to million for as we used some of our investment portfolio cash flows to reduce higher cost fhlb borrowings during interest expense 
interest expense for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million to million  or  from million in  primarily as a result of lower rates on our maturing certificates of deposit and lower rates on savings  money market and now accounts 
our total cost of deposits declined from during to during while our average interest bearing deposit balances decreased from million in to million in the lower interest rate environment of allowed us to reduce the rates paid on savings  money market and now accounts while generally maintaining our balances 
our higher cost certificate of deposit balances declined during as we priced our offering rates on new or maturing certificates of deposit to reflect our reduced need for funding 
average certificate of deposit balances declined from million in to million in during  interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  due to lower rates and average outstanding borrowings 
our cost of borrowing declined from in to in  while our average outstanding borrowings declined from million during to million during net interest income 
net interest income for decreased  to million  while our net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased  over the same periods 
our net interest margin increased from in to for the increase in net interest margin occurred primarily because we were able to reduce our costs of funding by more than our yields declined on our interest earning assets as our interest earning assets and liabilities continued to reprice lower 
during we were generally able to maintain yields on our loans while the yields on our investment securities and costs of deposits declined 
our cost of borrowings also declined as some of our higher cost fhlb borrowings matured during however  the improvement in net interest margin was not enough to offset our lower levels of average interest earning assets which declined from million in to million in provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses during increased million to million  compared to a provision of million during  primarily as a result of a million increase in our net loan charge offs during the increased net loan charge offs in were primarily related to the charge off of million of a previously identified and impaired construction loan totaling million  which experienced a significant decline in the appraised value of the collateral securing the loan 
also during  we charged off the remaining million balance on a commercial agriculture loan after exhausting our collection attempts 
the commercial agriculture loan charge off exceeded the reserves in the allowance for loan losses by  non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  for  to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increases of  in gains on sales of loans and  in fees and service charges 
our gains on sales of loans remained elevated in primarily due to refinancing activity as a result of low mortgage rates  as well as our expansion of the mortgage lending activities over the past few years 
typically  we sell most of our residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market which results in gains on sales of loans 
our fees and service charges increased as a result of higher fees and service charges on our deposit accounts and increased servicing fee income related to the residential real loans that were sold with servicing retained 
investment securities gains losses 
net gains and losses on investment securities experienced a favorable change of million between and we recorded credit related  other than temporary impairment losses on our investment securities portfolio during both and  but the net impairment loss declined from  during to  during also  we realized a  gain on the sale of investments in due to the sale of a portion of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio  compared to a gain on the sale of investments of only  during non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during  as compared to million during the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to increases of  in compensation and benefits   in foreclosure and real estate owned expense   in professional fees   in advertising and  in data processing 
annual increases in salary and the may acquisition of a branch in lawrence  kansas contributed to the increase in compensation and benefits expense in compared to our increase in foreclosure and real estate owned expense was a result of higher real estate owned balances and from a  increase in our provision to record valuation allowances to reflect declines in the fair value of certain real estate owned assets from to the increase in professional fees was primarily the result of legal action to pursue the guarantor of a construction loan which was partially charged off in and fully charged off in the higher advertising and data processing costs reflect costs associated with customer rewards program 
income taxes 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  or an effective tax rate of  during the decline in effective tax rate was driven by lower taxable income while our tax exempt investment income and bank owned life insurance income remained similar between the years

our asset quality and performance have been affected by the general economic conditions including difficult credit markets  depressed residential and commercial real estate values  generally depressed consumer confidence  heightened unemployment and decreased consumer spending 
even though the geographic markets in which the company operates have been impacted by these economic conditions in recent years  the effect has not been as severe as those experienced in some areas of the us in addition  our loan portfolio is diversified across various types of loans and collateral throughout the markets in which we operate 
outside of identified problem assets  management believes that it continues to have a high quality asset base and solid core earnings  and anticipates that its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future 
asset quality and distribution 
our primary investing activities are the origination of commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities 
total assets increased to million at december   compared to million at december  net loans  excluding loans held for sale  increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase in net loans was primarily the result of higher outstanding balances of municipal  commercial real estate and agriculture loans 
partially offsetting those increases were lower balances in our construction and land  consumer  one to four family residential real estate and commercial loans 
the decline in these loan balances is the result of multiple factors  including reduced loan demand from our customers 
the decline in our one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio is primarily due to normal runoff related to principal payments and prepayments 
generally  we originate fixed rate  residential mortgage loans with maturities in excess of ten years for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are typically sold soon after the loan closing 
during  we began retaining some of our newly originated one to four family residential real estate loans 
while we do not intend to increase our one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio  we are slowing the runoff of the portfolio by retaining some of the new loan originations to offset weak commercial loan demand  however  most of the new loan originations will still be sold 
we do not originate and warehouse these fixed rate residential loans for resale in order to speculate on interest rates 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activity 
this evaluation  which includes a review of all loans with respect to which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of gross loans outstanding  as compared to million  or of gross loans outstanding  at december  loans past due days and still accruing interest totaled million  or of gross loans at december  compared to million  or of gross loans  at december  the increase in loans past due days was primarily associated with various one to four family residential real estate loans 
at december   million in loans were on non accrual status  or of gross loans  compared to a balance of million  or of gross loans  at december  non accrual loans consist of loans or more days past due and certain impaired loans 
there were no loans days delinquent and still accruing interest at december  or december  our impaired loans totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the difference in the company s non accrual loan balances and impaired loan balances at december  was related to troubled debt restructurings that are current but still classified as impaired 
during  we had net loan charge offs of million compared to million during at december   we had five loan relationships that were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
during  we restructured three loan relationships that we identified as troubled debt restructurings 
one of the restructurings was a construction and land loan relationship totaling  which was secured by raw land which had experienced a severe decline in value 
as part of the agreement  we agreed to reduce the outstanding loan balance to  in exchange for a  principal payment in with the remaining  to be received during the first quarter of we had charged off  of the loan during and an additional  during  with the remaining  loan balance classified as non accrual and impaired as of december  the collateral deficiency of the raw land had previously been included in our allowance on impaired loans 
a loan relationship totaling  to a municipal sanitary and improvement district was also restructured in to extend the maturity and lower the interest rate to allow the district more time to develop 
the outstanding balance of  was classified as non accrual and impaired as of december  the restructuring did not impact our allowance for loan losses 
also during  a one to four family residential real estate loan totaling  was classified as a troubled debt restructuring as a result of the customer receiving a zero interest rate loan 
this loan was classified as impaired as of december  during  we restructured two loan relationships that were identified as troubled debt restructurings 
one of the relationships was an  real estate loan which was secured by real estate which was deficient based on the appraised value 
the relationship was restructured into two family residential real estate loans to a borrower who was experiencing financial difficulty and to whom we granted concessions at renewal 
the value of the real estate supported  of the loan relationship 
the  collateral deficiency of the real estate had previously been included in our allowance on impaired loans 
the loan was returned to accrual status during after a payment history was established  while the collateral deficiency was charged off 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the loan was  a second loan relationship totaling  to another municipal sanitary and improvement district was restructured in to extend the maturity and lower the interest rate to allow the district more time to develop 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the loan was  the restructuring did not impact our allowance for loan losses 
both of these loans were current and accruing interest at december   but still classified as impaired 
as part of our credit risk management  we continue to aggressively manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis on commercial real estate and construction and land relationships 
we are aggressively working to resolve the remaining problem credits or move the non performing credits out of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had million of real estate owned as compared to million at december  real estate owned primarily consists of a residential subdivision development we took possession of after the development slowed and the borrower was unable to comply with the contractual terms of the loan  a commercial real estate building resulting from a loan settlement  land previously acquired by the bank for expansion and a few residential real estate properties 
the company is currently marketing all of the properties in real estate owned 
many financial institutions  including us  experienced a general increase in non performing assets during recent years  as even well established business borrowers developed cash flow  profitability and other business related problems as a result of economic conditions 
while we have experienced improvement in our non performing loans and believe that our allowance for loan losses at december  was appropriate  there can be no assurances that loan losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
we believe that we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  however  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
further deterioration in the local economy or real estate values may create additional problem loans for us and require further adjustment to our allowance for loan losses 
liability distribution 
our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions 
we experienced a increase in total deposits during  to million at december   from million at december  the growth has primarily occurred in our non interest bearing demand  money market and now and savings accounts 
our time deposit balances have generally declined except for increases in our public fund and wholesale certificate of deposit balances 
the public fund customers in our markets generally use competitive bidding to award certificates of deposits to local financial institutions 
total borrowings increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increase was primarily a result of an increase in borrowings on our fhlb line of credit and in outstanding balances on our repurchase agreements 
non interest bearing deposits at december  were million  or of deposits  compared to million  or  at december  money market and now deposit accounts were of our deposit portfolio and totaled million at december   compared to million  or  at december  savings accounts increased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit increased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit at december   scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million 
historically  maturing deposits have generally remained with the bank and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with us upon maturity

liquidity 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given year 
these liquid assets totaled million at december  and million at december  during periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount of loans and or periods of high principal prepayments  we increase our liquid assets by investing in short term  high grade investments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of our strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments 
in the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are generally available through the use of fhlb advances  a line of credit with the fhlb  other borrowings or through sales of investment securities 
at december   we had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million in borrowings against our line of credit with the fhlb 
at december   we had collateral pledged to the fhlb that would allow us to borrow an additional million  subject to fhlb credit requirements and policies 
at december   we had no borrowings through the federal reserve discount window  while our borrowing capacity was million 
we also have various other fed funds agreements  both secured and unsecured  with correspondent banks totaling approximately million under which we had no outstanding borrowings at december  we had other borrowings of million at december   which included million of subordinated debentures and million in repurchase agreements 
the company has a million line of credit from an unrelated financial institution maturing on november   with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate plus  but not less than 
this line of credit has covenants specific to capital and other financial ratios  which the company was in compliance with at december  the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  was million  which was also included in other borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as a provider of financial services  we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
while these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay by us  a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
we have recourse against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
the letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies  underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us 
most of the standby letters of credit are secured  and in the event of nonperformance by the customers  we have the right to the underlying collateral  which could include commercial real estate  physical plant and property  inventory  receivables  cash and marketable securities 
the contract amount of these standby letters of credit  which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us  was million at december  at december   we had outstanding loan commitments  excluding standby letters of credit  of million 
we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet current loan commitments 
these commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance real estate loans 
capital 
the federal reserve has established capital requirements for bank holding companies which generally parallel the capital requirements for national banks under occ regulations 
the regulations provide that such standards will generally be applied on a consolidated rather than a bank only basis in the case of a bank holding company with more than million in total consolidated assets 
at december   we continued to maintain a sound leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  our capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage   tier capital   total risk based capital   at december   landmark national bank continued to maintain a sound leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  landmark national bank s capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage   tier capital   total risk based capital   banks and bank holding companies are generally expected to operate at or above the minimum capital requirements 
the above ratios are well in excess of regulatory minimums and should allow us to operate without capital adequacy concerns 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of establishes a bank rating system based on the capital levels of banks 
as of december  and  we were rated well capitalized  which is the highest rating available under this capital based rating system 
we have million in trust preferred securities which  in accordance with current capital guidelines  has been included in tier capital as of december  cash distributions on the securities are payable quarterly  are deductible for income tax purposes and are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
dividends during the year ended december   we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share to our stockholders 
additionally  we distributed a stock dividend for the eleventh consecutive year in december the quarterly cash dividends were per share as adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations 
as described above  landmark national bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of december  the national bank act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory approval 
generally  the amount is limited to the bank s current year s net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings for the two preceding years 
as of december   approximately million was available to be paid as dividends to landmark bancorp by landmark national bank without prior regulatory approval 
additionally  our ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures that are held by two business trusts that we control 
interest payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock  including our common stock 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to consecutive quarters 
however  if we elect to defer interest payments  all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
effects of inflation our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation can be found in the increased cost of our operations because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary and interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market interest rates and the mix of various assets and liabilities 
interest rates in the financial markets affect our decision on pricing our assets and liabilities which impacts our net interest income  a significant cash flow source for us 
as a result  a substantial portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
we have set policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation process 
in the past  we have been successful in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
simulation models are prepared to determine the impact on net interest income for the coming twelve months  including using rates at december  and forecasting volumes for the twelve month projection 
this position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of and basis points rising and basis points falling with an impact to our net interest income on a one year horizon as follows scenario s change in net interest income change in net interest income basis point rising basis point rising basis point falling asset liability management interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk which measures the relative dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which reprice within a specific time period  either through maturity or rate adjustment 
the gap is the difference between the amounts of such assets and liabilities that are subject to such repricing 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within that period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing during that same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the cost of its liabilities 
conversely  the cost of funds for an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to decline less quickly than the yield on its assets in a falling interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on an institution with a negative gap 
following is our static gap schedule 
one to four family and consumer loans include prepayment assumptions  while all other loans assume no prepayments 
mortgage backed securities include published prepayment assumptions  while all other investments assume no prepayments 
certificates of deposit reflect contractual maturities only 
money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  a higher percentage of the accounts have been included as repricing immediately in the first period 
savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive as money market accounts and for that reason a significant percentage of the accounts are reflected in the to year category 
we have been successful in meeting the interest sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
this has been accomplished primarily by managing the assets and liabilities while maintaining our traditional high credit standards
