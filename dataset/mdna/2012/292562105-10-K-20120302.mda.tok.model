item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of key factors  drivers and risks regarding the company and the building wire industry 
executive overview encore wire sells a commodity product in a highly competitive market 
management strongly believes that the historical strength of the company s growth and earnings is attributable to the following main factors industry leading order fill rates and responsive customer service 
product innovations and product line expansions based on listening to and understanding customer needs 
low cost manufacturing operations  resulting from a state of the art manufacturing complex 
low distribution and freight costs due to the one campus business model 
a focused management team leading an incentivized work force 
low general and administrative overhead costs 
a team of experienced independent manufacturers representatives with strong customer relationships across the united states 
these factors  and others  have allowed encore wire to grow from a startup in to what management believes is one of the largest copper electric building wire companies in the united states of america 
encore has built a loyal following of customers throughout the united states 
these customers have developed a brand preference for encore wire in a commodity product line  due to the reasons noted above  among others 
the company prides itself on striving to grow sales by expanding its product offerings where profit margins are acceptable 
senior management monitors gross margins daily  frequently extending down to the individual order level 
management strongly believes that this hands on focused approach to the building wire business has produced success thus far and will lead to continued success 
the construction and remodeling industries drive demand for building wire 
housing construction activity in the united states declined significantly in and continued its downward trend through  improving slightly in nationally  commercial construction had been relatively strong through  but slowed significantly in  and continued downward through the data that is available indicates that construction activity was flat to down from according to various industry and national economic forecasts the future is unclear for the next few years 
the credit crisis and the resulting tightening of credit could continue to negatively impact the availability of capital to fund construction projects for some time to come 
data on remodeling is not as readily available  however  remodeling activity historically trends up when new construction slows down 
general price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense  and the company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices 
copper  a commodity product  is the principal raw material used by the company in manufacturing its products 
copper accounted for approximately  and of the company s cost of 
table of contents goods sold during fiscal  and  respectively 
the price of copper fluctuates  depending on general economic conditions and in relation to supply and demand and other factors  which causes monthly variations in the cost of copper purchased by the company 
the company cannot predict copper prices in the future or the effect of fluctuations in the cost of copper on the company s future operating results 
wire prices can  and frequently do change on a daily basis 
this competitive pricing market for wire does not always mirror changes in copper prices  making margins highly volatile 
with the company s slow expansion into aluminum conductors in some of its building wire products  aluminum will slowly grow its percentage share of the raw materials cost for the company 
historically  the cost of aluminum is much less than copper and also less volatile 
with the volatility of both raw material prices and wire prices in the company s end market  hedging raw materials can be risky 
historically  the company has not engaged in hedging strategies for raw material purchases
