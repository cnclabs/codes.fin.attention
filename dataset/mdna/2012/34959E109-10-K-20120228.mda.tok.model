business overview we provide network security solutions  which enable broad  integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the it security infrastructure for enterprises  service providers and governmental entities worldwide 
as of december   we had shipped over  appliances via more than  channel partners to more than  end customers worldwide  including a majority of the fortune global our core utm product line of fortigate physical and virtual appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities  including firewall  vpn  application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  antispam and wan acceleration functionality 
we derive a substantial majority of product sales from our fortigate appliances  which range from the fortigate  designed for small businesses  to the fortigate series for large enterprises  telecommunications carriers  and service providers 
our utm solution also includes our fortiguard security subscription services  which end customers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to the application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  vulnerability management and antispam functionality included in our appliances 
end customers can also choose to purchase forticare technical support services for our products 
end customers also often use fortimanager and fortianalyzer products in conjunction with a fortigate deployment to provide centralized management  analysis and reporting capabilities 
we complement our core fortigate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise  such as messaging  web application firewalls  databases  employee 
table of contents computers and mobile devices 
sales of these complementary products have grown in recent quarters  although these products still represent less than of our total revenue 
during fiscal  we expanded and enhanced our fortigate utm and fortiap secure wireless access product lines  as well as introduced software based virtual appliances for many of our fortigate and fortimanager product lines  which help secure the end customer s cloud based network infrastructures with the same functionality as the traditional physical appliance in their respective product lines 
fiscal was our second full year as a public company  following our initial public offering in november we believe the greater visibility and brand recognition derived from being a public company  combined with success in selling to the enterprise and service provider customers and new product introductions  served as contributors to the growth in our business during fiscal sales of fortigate products have generally been balanced across entry level fortigate to series  mid range fortigate to series and high end fortigate to series models with each product category representing approximately one third of fortigate sales  with some degree of variability from year to year and between quarters 
during fiscal we executed well against our strategy to grow the high end segment of our business  consisting of sales to large enterprises  service providers and telecommunications companies 
the percentage of our fortigate related billings from the high end category increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  while the entry level category decreased from to  and the mid range category remained relatively flat over the same period 
this shift towards the high end category positively impacted results in fiscal we also believe continued product innovation has strengthened our technology advantage as evidenced by the earlier introduction of several noteworthy new fortigate appliance models such as the fg c  fg b  fg b and fg b 
during fiscal we also made a significant investment in our sales force to expand our global presence both geographically as well as by industry segment 
we believe these factors have allowed us to penetrate into larger enterprise and service provider accounts as evidenced by the increase in the number of deals involving sales greater than  billings a non gaap financial measure that we define as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue were million in fiscal  an increase of compared to fiscal total revenue was million for fiscal  an increase of compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal includes approximately million  or  positive impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules  as described in our summary of significant accounting policies included in footnote of our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in revenue resulting from our adoption of the new revenue recognition rules was attributable to both using best estimated sale price in our allocation of arrangement consideration when we did not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and being able to recognize upon shipment certain product revenue  which would have been deferred under the previous revenue recognition rules 
product revenue was million  an increase of compared to fiscal  and a greater percentage of total revenue in fiscal  compared to in fiscal 
introduction of new products  including some non fortigate products  was one factor in the growth of our product revenue 
services revenue in fiscal was million  an increase of compared to fiscal services revenue is important to our future revenue and profitability as it provides a source of recurring revenue for us  representing and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
ratable and other revenue in fiscal was million  a decrease of compared to fiscal  primarily due to the decline in ratable revenue amortization due to the new revenue recognition rules 
we are a global  geographically diversified business  with of our total revenue generated outside the united states  canada and other americas americas regions in fiscal our operating results were driven by strong performance across all geographies 
for fiscal  americas generated million  or  of our total revenue  representing an increase of from fiscal europe  middle east and africa emea generated million  or  of our total revenue during fiscal  representing an increase of from fiscal asia pacific and japan apac generated million  or  of our total revenue during fiscal  representing an increase of from fiscal in fiscal  our total operating expenses were million  an increase of compared to fiscal the increase in revenues compared to the increase in operating expenses in fiscal as discussed under results of operations below demonstrates the leverage that we achieved from the efficiencies in our business operations during the past year 
despite the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations experienced during fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to from during fiscal we are also experiencing improvements in productivity and efficiencies in our overall headcount as our annualized fiscal revenue per employee  defined as annual revenue divided by average headcount  reached  up from  for fiscal headcount increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal  as our pace of hiring increased during fiscal  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development 
our business model 
table of contents our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers  who  in turn  sell to our end customers 
in certain cases  we sell directly to government focused resellers  large service providers and major systems integrators  who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements 
typically  fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services are purchased along with our physical and virtual appliances 
we invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services  and the invoice generally becomes payable within to days 
we generally recognize product revenue up front based on the allocated revenue value and defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts 
we recognize the related services revenue over the service period  which is typically one year from the date the end customer registers for these services the date on which the services can first be used by the customer  although it can be as long as five years 
sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance  which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations 
key metrics we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  and assess operational efficiencies 
our total deferred revenue increased by million from million at december  to million at december  revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings 
billings for services drive deferred revenue  which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business  and has historically represented a majority of the revenue that we recognize in a typical quarter 
we also ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since we discuss revenue  gross margin  and the components of operating income and margin below under components of operating results  and we discuss our cash  cash equivalents  and investments under liquidity and capital resources 
deferred revenue and cash provided by operating activities are discussed immediately below the following table 
fiscal year or as of fiscal year end amounts in s revenue gross margin operating income operating margin total deferred revenue increase in total deferred revenue cash  cash equivalents and investments cash provided by operating activities free cash flow includes stock based compensation expense non cash asset acquisition related write offs patent settlement income see below for definition of free cash flow 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue 
the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts 
we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
the following table reflects the calculation of billings as discussed above 

table of contents fiscal year amounts in s billings revenue increase in deferred revenue total billings non gaap cash provided by operating activities 
we monitor cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance 
our cash provided by operating activities is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services 
monitoring cash provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non cash effects of certain items such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expenses  thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business 
free cash flow  an alternative non gaap financial measure of liquidity  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
fiscal year amounts in s cash flow net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment free cash flow non gaap net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities other non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with us gaap  we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap  including non gaap gross margin  non gaap operating income and non gaap operating margin  non gaap operating expenses  non gaap net income and non gaap free cash flow 
these non gaap financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
we use these non gaap financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors  as a supplement to gaap measures  in evaluating our ongoing operational performance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance  as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these non gaap financial measures 
furthermore  we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance 
we also believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are a number of limitations related to the use of these non gaap financial measures versus the nearest gaap equivalent of these financial measures 
first  these non gaap financial measures exclude certain recurring charges including  but not limited to  stock based compensation expense  asset acquisition related write offs  and patent settlements 
stock based compensation has been  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees overall compensation 
second  the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these non gaap financial measures may differ from the expenses  if any  that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations 
we compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest gaap equivalents of these non gaap financial measures and describing these gaap equivalents in our results of operations below 

table of contents non gaap gross margin is gross profit as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge 
non gaap income from operations is operating income  as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  asset acquisition related write offs  and the income we received from a patent settlement

the patent settlement income is removed from gaap net income to reconcile to non gaap income before taxes 
provision for income taxes is our gaap provision that must be added to gaap net income to reconcile to non gaap income before taxes 
the provision for fiscal included a million tax benefit from the reversal of our valuation allowance 
we used a effective tax rate in fiscal to calculate non gaap net income for fiscal the and effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  both reflect the exclusion of gaap based stock option benefits  as well as the reinstated federal r d credit 
components of operating results revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our products and subscription and support services 
in fiscal  we recognized our revenue in accordance with the guidance in asc which is discussed in further detail in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
according to asc  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
our total revenue is comprised of the following product revenue 
product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances and software 
the substantial majority of our product revenue has been generated by our fortigate line of appliances  and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future 
product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of fortimanager  fortianalyzer  fortiswitch  fortimail  fortidb  fortiweb  fortiap  fortiscan  forticarrier  fortibalancer  forticache  fortibridge  and fortiauthenticator appliances  and our forticlient and virtual domain  or vdom  software 
additionally  we generate revenue from the talkswitch line of telephony products 
we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to end customers upon shipment  once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we also recognize revenue upon sell through for distributor agreements that allow for rights of return 
such returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our product revenue may vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors discussed below under quarterly results of operations but generally may remain at relatively comparable levels or decline modestly over time  as services revenue becomes a larger portion of our business as our customers renew existing services contracts and we expand our customer base 
services revenue 
services revenue is generated primarily from forticare technical support services for software updates  maintenance releases and patches  internet access to technical content  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support  and fortiguard security subscription services related to application control  antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  antispam and vulnerability management updates 
we recognize revenue from subscription and support services over the service performance period 
our typical contractual support and subscription term is one year from the date of registration  although we do offer multi year support and subscription contracts 
we also generate a small portion of our revenue from professional services and training services  and we recognize this revenue as the services are provided 
as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our services revenue to remain at comparable levels or increase as our customers renew existing service contracts and we expand our customer base 
our services revenue growth rate depends significantly on the growth of our customer base and the renewal of service contracts by our current customers 
ratable and other revenue 
ratable and other revenue is generated from sales of our products and services in cases where the fair value of the services being provided cannot be separated from the value of the entire sale 
in these cases  the value of the entire sale is deferred and recognized ratably over the service performance period 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
ratable and other revenue was formerly referred to as ratable product and services revenue 
in  this category includes a million sale of previously acquired patents during the third quarter of fiscal in fiscal and  ratable and other revenue represented approximately and of total revenue  respectively 
over time we expect this category to continue to decline due to the new revenue recognition rules  which allow us to use best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration when we do not have vsoe 
our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following 
table of contents cost of product revenue 
a substantial majority of the cost of product revenue consists of third party manufacturing costs 
our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs  write offs for excess and obsolete inventory  royalty payments  amortization and any impairment of applicable acquired intangible assets  warranty costs  shipping and allocated facilities costs  stock based compensation costs  and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control 
personnel costs include cash based personnel costs such as salaries  benefits and bonuses 
royalties reflect amounts related to the trend micro litigation  which was settled in december  as discussed in item legal proceedings 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of cash based personnel costs associated with our fortiguard labs team and our technical support  professional services and training teams  as well as depreciation  supplies  data center  data communications  facility related costs and stock based compensation costs 
we expect our cost of services revenue will increase as we continue to invest in subscription and support services to meet the needs of our growing customer base 
cost of ratable and other revenue 
cost of ratable and other revenue is comprised primarily of deferred product costs and services related costs 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the average sales price of our products  any excess inventory write offs  manufacturing costs  the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services 
we believe our overall gross margin for the near term will remain at comparable levels compared to that achieved in fiscal services revenue has historically increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception  and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins 
we generally maintained consistent services gross margins in fiscal and fiscal operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cash based personnel costs such as salaries  benefits  bonuses and  with regard to the sales and marketing expense  and sales commissions 
they also include non cash charges  specifically  stock based compensation 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of cash based personnel costs 
additional research and development expenses include asic and system prototypes and certification related expenses  depreciation of capital equipment  facility related expenses and stock based compensation expenses 
the majority of our research and development is focused on both software development and the ongoing development of our hardware platform 
we record all research and development expenses as incurred  except for capital equipment which is depreciated over time 
our development teams are primarily located in canada  china  and the united states 
we expect our spending for research and development to increase in absolute dollars but remain comparable as a percentage of total revenue compared to fiscal results 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of cash based personnel costs including salary  benefits and commissions 
additional sales and marketing expenses include stock based compensation  promotional and other marketing expenses  travel  depreciation of capital equipment and facility related expenses 
we intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to increase our presence in new geographic markets and enterprise verticals  add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base 
accordingly  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to continue to be our largest operating expense but remain comparable as a percentage of total revenue compared to fiscal results 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of cash based personnel costs as well as professional fees  stock based compensation  depreciation of capital equipment and software  and facility related expenses 
general and administrative personnel include our executive  finance  human resources  information technology and legal organizations 
our professional fees principally consist of outside legal  auditing  accounting  information technology and other consulting costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel  make improvements to our information technology infrastructure  and defend our intellectual property  but remain 
table of contents comparable as a percentage of total revenue compared to fiscal results  barring unforeseen litigation 
interest income 
interest income consists of income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we have historically invested our cash in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate debt securities  municipal bonds  term deposits  and us government and agency debt securities 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign exchange and related hedging gains and losses 
foreign exchange gains and losses relate to foreign currency exchange re measurement 
the hedging gains and losses are related to our settled balance sheet hedges 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
we are subject to tax in the united states as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business 
earnings from our non us activities are subject to income taxes in the local country which are generally lower than us tax rates  and may be subject to current us income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to foreign income subject to different tax rates than the us  research and development tax credits  withholding taxes  nondeductible compensation and expenses and adjustments related to our intercompany transfer pricing 
the income tax provision for fiscal was comprised primarily of domestic income taxes  foreign income taxes and withholding taxes 
the effective tax rate was impacted by the inclusion of stock option benefits  which affected the transfer pricing calculations between some of our foreign subsidiaries as well as the reinstated us federal research and development tax credit 
the income tax provision for fiscal reflected a tax benefit related to the release of the valuation allowance  which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets 
as a result of fully reversing our valuation allowance  we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate the us federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes  research and development tax credits when applicable  withholding tax  nondeductible compensation and adjustments related to intercompany transfer pricing 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  valuation of inventory  warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to the financial statements included in this k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb amended the asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu amends industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions to exclude from its scope tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
asu amends the accounting for multiple element arrangements to provide guidance on how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and eliminates the use of the residual method 
asu also requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the standard establishes a hierarchy of evidence to determine the stand alone selling price of a deliverable based on vsoe  third party evidence tpe  and the besp 
if vsoe is available  it would be used to determine the selling price of a deliverable 
if vsoe is not available  the entity would determine whether tpe is available 
if so  tpe must be used to determine the selling price 
if tpe is not available  then the besp would be used 
for all transactions originating or materially modified after december   we recognize revenue in accordance with asu certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have software deliverables that are subject to asc along with non software deliverables that are subject to the asu when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware appliances  software  customer support services  and or professional services  we 
table of contents allocate revenue to each element based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
in multiple element arrangements where software is more than incidental  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy in asu vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major segments  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
for our hardware appliances we use besp as our selling price 
for our support and services  we generally use vsoe as our selling price 
when we are unable to establish a selling price using vsoe for our support and services  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we review our besp estimates on a quarterly basis to coincide with our vsoe review process 
we derive revenue from sales of products  including appliances and software  and services  including subscription  support and other services 
our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality 
as a result  we account for revenue in accordance with asc and all related interpretations 
see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new revenue recognition standards that we adopted in fiscal revenue can be recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
binding contracts or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs when we fulfill an order and title and risk of loss has been transferred or upon delivery of the service contract registration code 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
in the event payment terms differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to be not fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
collectability is probable 
we assess collectability based primarily on creditworthiness as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as payment history 
payment terms generally range from to days from invoice date 
for arrangements which include end customer acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized upon acceptance 
we recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no general right of return and direct sales to end customers upon shipment  once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we also recognize revenue upon sell through for distributor agreements that allow for rights of return 
such returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue 
substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with services  which consist of subscriptions and or support 
subscription services provide access to our antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  and anti spam functionality 
support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades  maintenance releases and patches  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel  and hardware support 
the subscription and support services start on the date the customer registers the appliance 
the customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date 

table of contents we offer certain sales incentives to channel partners 
we reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances 
additionally  in limited circumstances  we allow our customers to return our products  subject to varying limitations  for a refund within a reasonably short period of time from the date of purchase 
we estimate and record reserves for sales incentives and sales returns based on historical experience 
at december   our allowance for sales returns was million compared to million at december  if our allowance for sales returns had increased by  or million  our net revenue would have decreased by million in fiscal stock based compensation employees 
we have accounted for stock based awards to employees in accordance with asc  which requires compensation expense related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options 
the grant date fair value is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes pricing model 
for all employee stock options  we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method 
our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  expected term  and forfeiture rate 
any changes in these highly subjective assumptions could significantly impact stock based compensation expense 
employee stock purchase plan 
we apply asc to stock purchase rights  which requires compensation expense related to share based transactions  including stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan espp  to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
the grant date fair value is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes pricing model 
our espp provides for consecutive six month offering periods  with the first offering period having commenced on august  and ended on february  valuation of inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market  after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand  the timing of new product introductions  economic trends and market conditions 
if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs which would be charged to cost of product revenue 
any write downs could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
warranty liabilities we generally provide a one year warranty on hardware products and a day warranty on software 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed more likely than not that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws 
tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits  relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period 
changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
asc requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
we 
table of contents consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws  or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
as a result  we released all of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods

the increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal reflected the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in fiscal we generated pretax income in fiscal and as a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income  we reversed approximately million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal after having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
this reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling million 
our estimates of future taxable income represent critical accounting estimates because such estimates are subject to change and a downward adjustment could have a significant impact on future earnings 
furthermore  we continue to evaluate our net deferred tax asset position  in regards to the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets

seasonality  cyclicality and quarterly revenue trends our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products  subscriptions and services 
in general  a pattern of increased customer buying at year end has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter 
in the first quarter we generally experience lower sequential billings and product revenues  which results in lower product revenue 
our product revenue in the third quarter can be negatively affected by reduced economic activity in europe during the summer months 
during fiscal  the growth in the americas during the third quarter more than offset the slight decline in europe  but this may not always be the case 
similarly  our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the near term 
although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector  historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance 
on a quarterly basis  we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter 
we believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry 
our total quarterly revenue over the past twelve quarters has increased sequentially in each quarter except the first quarter of which was essentially flat 
product revenue in all of the quarters of fiscal was higher as compared to the same periods in fiscal  which we believe was due in part to the investments made in our sales organization  continued product innovation and improvements in overall corporate it spending  as well as the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules in fiscal

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk 
table of contents the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates in  and would have resulted in a decrease in our interest income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency translation risk 
however  a substantial portion of our operating expenses incurred outside the us are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the canadian dollar cad  euro eur  british pound gbp  and japanese yen jpy 
to help protect against significant fluctuations in the value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we engage in foreign currency risk management activities to hedge balance sheet items denominated in eur  gbp  and cad 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the derivative instruments are with high quality financial institutions  and we monitor the creditworthiness of these parties 
these contracts typically have maturities between one and three months 
we account for our hedges under asc derivatives and hedging 
we record changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts related to balance sheet accounts as other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
we recognized an expense of million in other income expense  net in fiscal due to foreign currency transaction losses 
our hedging activities are intended to reduce  but not eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
as our hedging activities are relatively short term in nature  long term material changes in the value of the us dollar versus the eur  gbp  cad  or jpy could adversely impact our operating expenses in the future 
inflation risk our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  are not affected significantly by inflation because they are short term 
we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
the rate of inflation  however  affects our cost of revenue and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of products and services offered by us
