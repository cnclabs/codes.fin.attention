on february   we acquired sonic solutions sonic for approximately million in cash and stock 
we believe the sonic acquisition not only enhances our offerings to our business customers  but also facilitates the next step forward in our strategy of providing connected consumers the capability to find content they are seeking using our technologies and metadata  as well as to enjoy that content from multiple sources on any device 
on february   we sold our roxio consumer software business 
the results of the roxio consumer software business have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
industry background the entertainment media market continues its transformation from analog to digital content and from physical to online distribution 
the design  distribution  protection and consumption of all forms of digital 
table of contents content continues to experience an unprecedented amount of change 
the expansion of network bandwidth  the increased availability of digital content and devices that allow people to enjoy digital content  and the increased mobility provided by tablets and smartphones are all helping to accelerate this market shift 
as part of this change  consumers are demanding high quality digital content in many formats and places 
users are also seeking flexible means by which to legally acquire and add content to their digital libraries permanently or for a period of time and want to be able to enjoy that content in numerous locations on different devices 
they want to easily discover and access content movies  music  photos and programming and enjoy it when and where they want 
no matter what content consumers desire or are enjoying  we believe video content such as movies and tv shows remains important 
new devices and services are continually being created that bring video content to consumers 
consumers are in an upgrade cycle investing in high end high definition televisions hdtvs that help maximize video enjoyment 
additionally  consumers are investing in new devices  such as tablets and smartphones  with the intent to use them to enjoy digital content  among other uses 
these devices require the ability to provide information identifying what is available to the viewer in broadcast television tv listings  stored or packaged video and video on demand vod or even professional short form video such as news clips or comedy shorts 
we refer to providing this information as guidance 
guidance becomes more complex as more sources of entertainment become available to consumers 
beyond existing pay tv options  consumers can now download or stream internet based content to their media devices  accessed via several different business models 
in addition  the current home media device infrastructure can be very complex 
setting up such an environment generally requires integrating numerous devices  a deep understanding of the interoperability of media formats and creation of mechanisms for managing and enjoying content 
the alternative is to purchase products from a single vendor and sacrifice the ability to integrate all types of media into many devices or have many devices operating in silos  significantly limiting the mobility and flexibility that consumers desire 
the introduction of these new capabilities are impacting every part of the entertainment supply chain  from content producers  to distribution channels and consumption device manufacturers  causing them each to reevaluate their business models  as well as introducing new competitors at each phase of the supply chain 
in the case of content producers  the industry shift to digital media  ip enabled entertainment platforms  and portable digital devices such as tablets and smartphones threatens current revenue models built on tightly controlled distribution windows 
consumers seek to enjoy movies and tv shows at their own convenience  not necessarily watching tv at home or going to the theaters 
as a result  the existing revenue streams based upon theater attendance  packaged media sales and television broadcasts are all threatened 
as technological advances facilitate digital downloads and digital copying  motion picture studios  music labels  cable  satellite  broadcast television and program distributors have become more concerned with how to protect their intellectual property  while making it available to consumers in the manner they wish to receive it  without sacrificing the aggregate revenue returned from today s various distribution windows 
studios have invested heavily in shifting consumers to a digital purchase model and sponsored standards based initiatives  such as ultraviolet  to build this new business model amidst these shifting economics 
distribution channels  such as cable and satellite operators  web portals and retailers  and others are all seeking ways to best obtain or maintain a competitive advantage in a digital entertainment world 
they require highly customizable solutions that aid the consumer experience  such as additional data about the entertainment content  or additional guidance technology  while still allowing the distribution channel to retain its unique identity 
they are also seeking to increase their interaction with the consumer and create new revenue opportunities 
this includes having not just a physical and web presence  but also providing media digitally on any device the consumer may choose to use 
this requires substantial investment in technology infrastructure to augment their current businesses 
additionally  content producers are exploring new forms of distribution to protect or advance their position in the distribution window chain  which includes experimenting with direct to 
table of contents consumer models and new forms of content licensing  such as exclusive downloads  subscription to a studio s portfolio  or making a streamed or downloaded movie available for purchase simultaneous with the home video distribution window 
all of this results in increased competition for distributors  leading to their need to create unique distribution arrangements and to integrate with many partners to reach consumers 
the markets for consumer electronic ce manufacturers are also in flux 
consumers are demanding capabilities to interact with broad ranges of media  such as over the top video  not just viewing content that is broadcast to the device 
increased functionality requires extensive software be embedded into these devices  which is not necessarily a core competency for ce manufacturers 
new types of devices such as tablets are also competing for consumers spending as consumers become more comfortable with new ways of enjoying their entertainment 
ce manufacturers also desire an ongoing revenue relationship with their customer  not just to sell them a new device every few years 
this leads to a demand for add on services or advertising that allow the ce manufacturer to profit from the on going distribution or maintenance of entertainment content 
as traditional media changes  the opportunities for advertisers evolve as well 
currently advertisers spend more heavily on television commercials than any other form of advertising 
as television viewership has become more fragmented  advertisers have sought new ways to reach consumers 
advertisers are now experimenting across the many devices and applications consumers use to access digital media 
additionally  the growth of web advertising has increased the criteria advertisers use to evaluate successful advertising  adding metrics such as personalization and guaranteed views 
rovi s markets we sell our products into the following market verticals i service providers cable  satellite  telecommunications  mobile and internet service providers among others  ii ce manufacturers  and iii other 
service providers our service provider vertical generated  and of our revenue from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
ipgs an ipg is an interactive listing of television or video program information that enables viewers to navigate through  sort  select and schedule video programming for viewing and recording 
we believe that interactive video guidance technology is a necessary tool for television viewers bombarded with an increasing amount of available content and an increasing number of digital cable and satellite television channels  vod services  and ip enabled download services 
the ipg is evolving from a guide to linear television content to a guide for all the digital content that users have access to in the home or available to them on their tv  including programming delivered over the internet 
our service provider licensees either deploy ipgs provided by the company or  pursuant to an ipg patent license  their own ipg or a third party ipg 
for service providers that deploy one of our ipgs  we also offer operational support  content  professional services and data 
our ipgs allow service providers to customize certain elements of the ipgs for their customers and also allow these providers to upgrade  over time  the features and services they can offer to their customers 
our service provider ipgs are compatible with service providers subscription management  pay per view ppv and vod services

most of our service provider ipgs also feature advertising 
additionally  we work with some service providers to sell advertising on a guide that they have developed and package their subscriber footprint into the entire footprint that we offer advertisers 
service providers who have a patent license from us are not required to provide advertising in their ipg 
however  our agreements with domestic service providers generally require the sharing of advertising revenue if ipg advertising is provided 
historically  we have primarily sold broadcasters  or their agencies  the opportunity to promote their products via advertisements inserted in ipgs 
our most recent guides even allow an advertisement for a specific television program to link directly to the tv channel it is on or allow consumers to program a recording or a reminder from the ad 
however  conventional advertisers  or their agencies  are our largest source of advertising growth 
we offer packages to advertisers to provide them nationwide or targeted advertising on a guide for a period of time 
advertisers place ads through a variety of display formats incorporated into the guide screens 
depending on the ipg deployed  advertisements can display additional text information or video when clicked on via the remote control 
advertisers can target specific audiences by airing advertising at certain times of the day or in specific geographies 
we believe conventional advertisers are increasingly aware of the value proposition for advertisements inserted in ipgs 
to demonstrate the value of this advertising  we began measuring usage and ad views by consumers for certain service provider guides deployed in the united states a clickstream analysis in late this information has increased and  we believe  will continue to increase our revenue from advertising by offering the advertiser evidence of the reach of a given advertisement or time slot 
service providers generally pay us a monthly per subscriber fee 
service providers in the online space generally pay us a fee based on unique users 
we have also entered into agreements with certain licensees that enable them to provide an ipg to an unlimited number of subscribers or unique users  provided they pay us a specified flat fee 
we also include in service provider revenues any revenue related to an ipg deployed by a service provider in a subscriber household whether the ultimate payment for that ipg comes from the service provider or from a manufacturer of a set top 
table of contents box 
we generally do not receive a license fee from manufacturers for set top boxes deployed by a cable or satellite provider where that provider has also licensed our ipg technology 
our service provider customers include british sky broadcasting group  canal  charter  comcast corporation comcast  cox communications  cablevision  directv  echostar communications  foxtel  megacable  sky deutschland  sky italia  shaw communications  time warner cable  upc  verizon and others

the content is not only integrated with the totalguide user interface  but also with our database so that a consumer can search and access the media that the content partner makes available for free  purchase or rental 
whether these relationships provide us with revenue depends on the content distributor as well as the company s agreement with ce manufacturers  who then must determine which content distributor s services they desire to have integrated into their devices

advertisements within totalguide are selectable  allowing a more interactive experience  including commerce

expand and protect patent position 
we have built  and continue to add to  a large patent portfolio that helps differentiate our products 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce proprietary solutions for ipgs  connected devices and data 
we have patented many of these proprietary solutions  and our patents underpin our strong competitive position and financial model 
we also have acquired patents from others 
we intend to continue to obtain patents and to protect and defend our patented technologies aggressively 
continue to make strategic acquisitions 
we may continue to expand our technology portfolio and extend our businesses by pursuing licensing arrangements  joint ventures  and strategic acquisitions of companies whose technologies or proprietary rights complement our technologies

we support the efforts of television  pvr  and dvd hardware manufacturers  digital ppv vod system operators and ppv vod set top box manufacturers to design hardware that properly incorporates and is compatible with our video content security solutions 
we operate the internet based services needed to power the rovi entertainment store and rovi cloud services 
for the rovi entertainment store this includes hosting the video content and content management system  operating the commerce function or integrating with appropriate agents  and operating the backend of storefronts  including delivery of video content purchased or rented by consumers 
for rovi cloud services this includes data delivery  search  recommendations  advertising  device management and media recognition 
we occasionally take end user calls related to these services 
we provide broadcast data delivery of television line up data and advertising to tvs and set top boxes enabled with our ipgs in north america  major european markets and japan 
this service provides the data that populates the guides with the listings and advertising necessary to make the ipg useful to a consumer 
in addition  we deliver  via the internet or satellite  similar line up and advertising data to cable and satellite providers in north america 
we support our customers efforts to ensure our ipgs operate properly within their devices  by offering porting services 
we provide customer care for ipg customers following deployment of our ipgs 
this service deals with issues with data and advertising distribution as well as functional issues for a consumer 
we assist semiconductor manufacturers in incorporating and certifying our video content security solutions  divx and rovi entertainment store technology into a variety of digital video integrated circuits 
we regularly test the effectiveness and transparency of our video content protection technologies on representative samples of consumer televisions  dvd players  dvd drives  pvrs  and recorder devices to determine whether modifications or enhancements may be necessary 
we test for ripguard compatibility and effectiveness with a variety of cd dvd drive software and hardware 

table of contents intellectual property rights we operate in an industry in which innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success 
we protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means  including but not limited to applying for patent protection domestically and internationally 
as of december   we hold us patents and have us patent applications pending 
we also have  foreign patents issued and  foreign patent applications pending 
each of our us issued patents will expire at a different time based on the particular filing date of that respective patent  with expiration dates as late as competition ipgs there are a number of companies that produce and market ipgs as well as television schedule information in various other formats  that compete or we believe will compete with our ipg products and services 
these alternative formats include passive and interactive on screen electronic guide services and online listings 
a common competitor we encounter is a customer who chooses to build its own ipg and license our intellectual property 
we believe that we provide a strong alternative to do it yourself  as we have products ready to be implemented and already have data distribution infrastructure and content as well as integration to third party services such as vod services for service providers 
we intend to build differentiation by continuing to integrate our products into a suite of products and services to provide solutions for our customers 
we believe our solutions can speed our customers time to market  be deployed at a lower cost than internally built products  and are superior to do it yourself products 
for those that choose to do it themselves we have added rovi cloud services to provide them services that can power their self developed experience 
we have begun to see activity from web properties or device manufacturers  such as yahoo and google  or boxee entering the ce market  namely embedded in tvs in north america or by launching their own devices 
such companies could offer competitive functionality in the future 
many of our competitors and other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that may directly or indirectly affect the products or services offered or under development by us 
we are currently developing a variety of enhancements to our ipgs 
we cannot assure that any enhancements developed by us would not be found to infringe patents that are currently held or may be issued to others 
there can be no assurance that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services 
in addition  patent applications are generally confidential for a period of months from the filing date  or until a patent is issued in some cases  so we cannot evaluate the extent to which certain products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications prior to their publication 
in general  if one or more of our products or services were to infringe patents held by others  we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
this could have an effect on our ability to compete in the ipg marketplace 
divx codecs we face significant competition in the digital media markets in which we operate 
we believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that have the collective financial  technical and other resources to develop the technologies  services  products  and partnerships necessary to create a digital media ecosystem that can compete with the divx ecosystem 
for example  companies such as amazon 
com  apple  
table of contents google  microsoft  sony  yahoo and adobe systems may have competitive advantages over us because of their greater size and resources and the strength of their respective brand names 
in addition  some of our current or potential competitors  such as apple  dolby laboratories  microsoft and sony  may be able to offer integrated system solutions in certain markets for entertainment technologies  including audio  video and rights management technologies related to personal computers or the internet  which could make competing products and technologies that we develop unnecessary 
by offering an integrated system solution  these potential competitors also may be able to offer competing products and technologies at lower prices than our products and technologies 
further  many of the consumer hardware and software products that include our technologies also include technologies developed by our competitors 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our technologies and our existing products and introduce new high quality technologies and products to meet the wide variety of such competitive pressures 
we also compete with companies that offer products or services that compete with specific aspects of our digital media ecosystem 
for example  our digital rights management technology competes with technologies from companies such as apple  contentguard  intertrust technologies  microsoft  nagra audio and nds group  as well as the internal development efforts of certain of our licensees 
our proprietary video compression technologies also compete with other video compression technologies  including other implementations of mpeg or implementations of h 
avc 
in addition  a number of companies such as adobe systems  apple  ateme  google  microsoft  and realnetworks offer video formats that compete with our proprietary video format 
rovi entertainment store the rovi entertainment store faces a wide range of competition from other companies seeking to position themselves strategically as the digital distribution of hollywood movies and other premium content grows in scope and importance 
significant competition exists from well established traditional premium content distribution channels  including retailers that rent  sell or trade dvds and games  cable and satellite vod services  and other in home entertainment 
consumers have a variety of vendor choices and multiple distribution options for premium content consumption  and we believe that this competition will increase over the coming years as the proliferation of digital delivery continues 
some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  may enjoy greater brand recognition than we do  or may have more experience or advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete 
content security technology our video content security solutions are proprietary and have broad us and international patent coverage 
we have an analog content security solution that has been widely deployed on commercial products that significantly distorts or inhibits copying by pvrs  including dvd recorders and hard drive recorders with an analog out 
currently  our video content security technology is embedded in nearly all dvd players and most digital set top boxes worldwide 
while it is possible that a competitive video content security technology could be developed and deployed  we believe it would take years for the competitive technology to be accepted by hardware manufacturers and embedded into the consumer electronic devices 
given the time this would take  it is unlikely any other analog content security technology would displace our content security infrastructure and our extensive video content security ecosystem 
the greatest competitive threat to our content security technology is content providers choosing not to copy protect their content or ce manufacturers ceasing to produce pvrs with an analog out 
with the increase in online content distribution over the internet  and with the continuing advance of digital content and high definition formats  our analog video content security solutions that protect standard definition 
table of contents content on optical media and digital ppv vod signals are viewed by some of our customers as being less important than the other digital and network content protection solutions 
as a result  other internet based digital content security or drm technologies may present significant competition to our video content security business  such as drm offerings by intertrust  microsoft  apple  realnetworks  contentguard  philips  ibm and sony 
data services in the database and data services area  we compete with other providers of entertainment related content data such as tribune media services  internet movie database imdb and gracenote 
while we do not believe that our competitors data sets are focused on exploration  discovery  and content management in the way that our data is  nor are they tightly tied to a portfolio of software to which they add significant value  they may present competition to our data services business 
media recognition technology in the recognition technology and ce manufacturer area  our primary competitor is gracenote  who provides media recognition technology as part of their cddb data set 
their core technology provides basic album and track metadata when a cd is inserted into a drive 
shazam entertainment also sells a music media recognition technology 
legislative and regulatory actions a number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners 
for example  the united states and other countries have adopted certain laws  including the digital millennium copyright act of  or dmca  and the european copyright directive  which are aimed at the prevention of piracy of content and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies  such as those covered by our patents 
vbi and digital data carriage matters we use the vertical blanking interval  or vbi  in the analog television signals of the local affiliates of major broadcast networks to supply updates throughout the day of program listing information to our guidance solutions for consumer electronics devices in the united states 
we have agreements which allow for the distribution of our ce ipg data over the digital broadcast signals of participating stations  following the installation of necessary equipment 
the federal communications commission fcc has ruled that it is within the discretion of a cable multiple system operator mso to retransmit or strip out data transmitted in the vbi lines of broadcast stations carried on that mso s system 
we have agreements with msos which provide for carriage of our program listing information in either the vbi or within the digital signal of broadcast television stations 
compatibility between cable systems and consumer electronic equipment the fcc has been working for over a decade to implement a congressional mandate that it create a competitive market for cable television set top boxes and other devices to access video programming on cable systems navigation devices and give consumers a choice in the device used to access such programming  while still allowing the cable systems to have control over the secured access to their systems 
to meet its statutory obligation without compromising the security of video services  the commission required cable systems to make available a security element now known as a cablecard separate from the basic navigation device needed to access video program channels 
in  the fcc adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators and consumer electronics manufacturers 
table of contents to facilitate the retail availability of so called plug and play devices that utilize unidirectional cablecards  including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a set top box but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content 
due to certain legislative developments in the us  cable subscribers may be able to utilize interactive and other two way services without the need for a set top box  meaning that consumers could use an ipg built directly into a tv to access and operate their cable subscriptions and not need to purchase or rent a set top box from the cable operator 
in an effort to ensure that cable operators adequately support cablecards  fcc regulations also prohibited multi channel video service providers except satellite providers from deploying after july   navigation devices with combined security and non security functions the integration ban 
both cable operators and consumer electronics manufacturers are required to use the same security solution 
further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and or demand for plug and play devices  particularly bi directional devices  and set top boxes  all of which could affect demand for ipgs incorporated in set top boxes or ce devices 
general government regulation we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies that import or export software and technology  including encryption technology  such as the us export control regulations as administered by the us department of commerce 
we are also subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet 
in addition  because of the increasing popularity of the internet and the growth of online services  laws relating to user privacy  freedom of expression  content  advertising  accessibility  network neutrality  information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world 
each jurisdiction may enact different standards  which could impact our ability to deliver data  services or other solutions on the internet 
we may be further subject to international laws associated with data protection  privacy and other aspects of our business in europe and elsewhere and the interpretation and application of data protection laws is still uncertain and in flux 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide  foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws 
in addition  the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear 
the resulting regulation  if any  may alter our ability to target advertising or provide data about the end users and or customers and their behavior 
in the us  online service providers have been subject to claims of defamation  libel  invasion of privacy and other data protection claims  tort  unlawful activity  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted or the content generated by users 
in addition  several other federal laws could have an impact on our business 
for example  the digital millennium copyright act has provisions that limit  but do not eliminate  our liability for hosting or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights  so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act 
the children s online privacy protection act restricts the ability of online services to collect information from minors  and the protection of children from sexual predators act of requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
of these employees  approximately were based outside of the united states 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any organized work stoppages 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon the continued service of our key employees and on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key employees and may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to conduct our business in the future

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following risks 
this list is not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
if any of these risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and timely deliver innovative technologies in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries  our business could decline 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution 
we will need to continue to expend considerable resources on research and development in the future in order to continue to design and deliver enduring  innovative entertainment products and technologies 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to develop timely and effectively market new products  technologies and services that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
in addition  we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities 
at times  such changes can be dramatic  such as the shift from vhs videocassettes to dvds for consumer playback of movies in homes and elsewhere or the transition from packaged media to internet distribution 
our future success depends to a great extent on our ability to develop and timely deliver innovative technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries and that are compatible with the technologies or products introduced by other entertainment industry participants 
despite our efforts and investments in developing new products  services and technologies we cannot assure you that the level of funding and significant resources we are committing for investments in new products  services and technologies will be sufficient or result in successful new products  services or technologies  we cannot assure you that our newly developed products  services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot assure you that any new products or services that we develop will achieve market acceptance  our products  services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences  we cannot assure you that revenue from new products  services or technologies will offset any decline in revenue from our products  services and technologies which may become obsolete  and our competitors and or potential customers may develop products  services or technologies similar to those developed by us  resulting in a reduction in the potential demand for our newly developed products  services or technologies 
our failure to successfully develop new and improved products  services and technologies  including as a result of any of the risks described above  may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business  results and financial condition 

table of contents our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we do  which could reduce demand for our products or render them obsolete and if competition increases or if we are unable to effectively compete with existing or new competitors  the result could be price reductions  fewer customers and loss of market share  any of which could result in less revenue and harm our business 
our ipgs face competition from companies that produce and market program guides as well as television schedule information in a variety of formats  including passive and interactive on screen electronic guide services  online listings  over the top applications  printed television guides in newspapers and weekly publications  and local cable television guides 
our ipg products also compete against customers who choose to build their own ipg and license our intellectual property 
our divx and rovi entertainment store solutions face competition in the digital media markets in which we operate 
we believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that have the collective financial  technical and other resources to develop the technologies  services  products and partnerships necessary to create a digital media ecosystem that can compete with the divx ecosystem 
those potential competitors currently include adobe systems  apple  google  microsoft  and yahoo 
we also compete with companies that offer products or services that compete with specific aspects of our digital media ecosystem 
for example  our digital rights management technology competes with technologies from companies such as apple  contentguard  intertrust technologies  microsoft  nagra audio and nds group  as well as the internal development efforts of certain of our licensees 
in addition  we compete with companies such as yahoo  vudu  inc  a subsidiary of wal mart stores  inc  boxee  inc 
and with internally developed proprietary solutions developed by hardware device manufacturers and integrated circuit manufacturers in our development and marketing of technologies to enable the next generation of internet enabled consumer electronics devices 
our proprietary technologies also compete with other video compression technologies  including other implementations of mpeg or implementations of h 
avc 
in addition  a number of companies such as adobe systems  apple  ateme  google  microsoft  and realnetworks offer video formats that compete with our proprietary video format 
we also face competition from subscription entertainment services  cable and satellite providers  dvds and other emerging technologies and products related to content distribution 
our content distribution platforms and services face significant competition from services  such as peer to peer and content aggregator services  which allow consumers to directly access an expansive array of content without securing licenses from content providers 
in the connected device middleware and metadata marketplace  there is competition not only from other companies  but also from customer implemented internally developed solutions 
we believe that our dvd digital to analog copy protection and videocassette copy protection systems currently have limited competition 
it is possible  however  that alternative copy protection technologies could become competitive 
additionally  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of these areas 
the markets for the consumer hardware and software products sold by our oem customers are competitive and price sensitive 
licensing fees for our technologies  products and services  particularly in the physical media area  may decline due to competitive pricing pressures and changing consumer demands 
in addition  our retail sales business is also subject to competitive pricing pressures  and we may experience pricing pressures in other parts of our business 
these trends could make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain our revenue and could adversely affect our operating results 
to increase per unit royalties  we must continue to introduce new  highly functional versions of our technologies  products and services for which we can charge higher amounts 
any inability to introduce such technologies  products and services in the future or other declines in the amounts we can charge would also adversely affect our revenues 
some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  may enjoy greater brand recognition than we do  or may have more experience or 
table of contents advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete 
in addition  some of our current or potential competitors  such as apple  dolby laboratories  microsoft and sony  may be able to offer integrated system solutions in certain markets for entertainment technologies  including audio  video and rights management technologies related to personal computers or the internet  which could make competing products and technologies that we develop unnecessary 
by offering an integrated system solution  these potential competitors also may be able to offer competing products and technologies at lower prices than our products and technologies 
further  many of the consumer hardware and software products that include our technologies also include technologies developed by our competitors 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our technologies and our existing products and introduce new high quality technologies and products to meet the wide variety of such competitive pressures 
our ability to generate revenues from our business will suffer if we fail to do so successfully 
our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for consumer electronics devices incorporating our technologies 
we derive significant revenues from ce manufacturer license fees for our solutions that are based on the number of units shipped 
we do not manufacture hardware  but rather depend on the cooperation of ce manufacturers to incorporate our technologies into their products 
generally  our license agreements do not require manufacturers to include our technology in any specific number or percentage of units  and only a few of these agreements guarantee a minimum aggregate licensing fee 
purchases of new ce devices  including television sets  integrated satellite receiver decoders  dvrs  dvd recorders  personal computers and internet appliances are largely discretionary and may be adversely impacted by increasing market saturation  durability of products in the marketplace  new competing products  alternate consumer entertainment options and general economic trends in the countries or regions in which these products are offered 
global economic downturns may significantly impact demand for such ce devices 
as a result  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in sales of ce devices employing our technologies 
the decision by manufacturers to incorporate our solutions into their products is a function of what other guide technologies and products are available 
our future operating results may be adversely impacted as a result of ce manufacturers opting not to incorporate our technology into their devices as a result of other available alternatives 
dependence on the cooperation of cable multi system operators msos and digital broadcast satellite dbs providers  television broadcasters  hardware manufacturers  publications  data providers and delivery mechanisms could adversely affect our revenues 
we rely on third party providers to deliver our ipg data to ce devices that include our ipg 
further  our national data network provides customized and localized listings to our ipg service for msos and dbs providers and licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos and dbs providers 
in addition  we purchase some of our program guide information from commercial vendors 
the quality  accuracy and timeliness of that data may not continue to meet our standards or be acceptable to consumers 
we also rely on other arrangements in the united states  which are not long term  with other broadcasters for secondary carriage of our ipg data to ce devices 
there can be no assurance that these delivery mechanisms will distribute the data without error or that the agreements that govern some of these relationships can be maintained on favorable economic terms 
our inability to renew these existing arrangements on terms that are favorable to us  or enter into alternative arrangements that allow us to effectively transmit our ipg data to ce devices could have a material adverse effect on our ce ipg business 
our ipg data to ce devices broadcast can be  and has been in the past in some markets  deleted or modified by some of the local service providers 
widespread deletion or modification of this data by service providers could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
furthermore  in order for ce devices that incorporate our ipg to receive our data  such data must also be able to pass through any receivers through which 
table of contents such ce devices are receiving television programming signals 
even if our ipg data is passed to cable subscribers through cable networks by the service providers  there is a risk that the cable set top boxes deployed by such subscribers can impede the passage of our ipg data to ce devices 
widespread impedance of our ipg data to ce devices in any of the manners set forth above could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
we deliver our data to our ipg service for msos and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos via satellite transmission  among other means 
while we have built in certain redundancies in our data delivery operation  a third party provides us with satellite capacity to transmit our data to our ipg service for certain msos and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos 
our arrangement with the third party provider may be terminated on little or no notice 
in the event that a provider of satellite capacity elects not to provide this capacity to transmit our data  there can be no assurance that all of our customers who currently receive our data via such provider will be able to receive our data via alternative means without significant delay or additional cost to us 
in the event that such provider elects not to transmit our data  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are exposed to risks associated with our changing technology base through strategic acquisitions  investments and divestitures 
we have expanded our technology base in the past through strategic acquisitions of companies with complementary technologies or intellectual property and intend to do so in the future 
acquisitions hold special challenges in terms of successful integration of technologies  products and employees 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and divestitures we have completed in the past or the benefits of any other acquisitions or divestitures we may complete in the future  and we may not be able to incorporate any acquired services  products or technologies with our existing operations  or integrate personnel from the acquired businesses  in which case our business could be harmed 
acquisitions  divestitures and other strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems integrating and divesting the operations  technologies  personnel or products over geographically disparate locations  unanticipated costs  litigation and other contingent liabilities  continued liability for pre closing activities of divested businesses or certain post closing liabilities which we may agree to assume as part of the transaction in which a particular business is divested  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering into markets in which we have no  or limited  prior experience  incurrence of significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful  significant diversion of management s attention from our core business and diversion of key employees time and resources  inability to retain key customers  distributors  vendors and other business partners of the acquired business  and potential loss of our key employees or the key employees of an acquired organization 
the merger agreement governing the acquisition of sonic and its subsidiaries also did not contain any post closing indemnification provisions 
therefore  any claims for known or unknown sonic or divx liabilities  whether related to intellectual property ownership  infringement or otherwise  are our responsibility 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and divert management s attention 

table of contents to the extent that expenses increase but revenues do not or there are significant costs associated with presently unknown liabilities  our business  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
in addition  failure to minimize the numerous risks associated with the post acquisition integration strategy also may adversely affect the trading price of rovi s common stock 
financing for future acquisitions may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate for any of our businesses  we may not be able to negotiate the terms of the acquisition successfully  finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or employees into our existing business and operations 
future acquisitions and divestitures may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause the value of our stock to fall 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to identify or complete any acquisition or divestiture in the future 
further  the terms of our indebtedness constrains our ability to make and finance additional acquisitions or divestitures 
if we acquire businesses  new products or technologies in the future  we may incur significant acquisition related costs 
in addition  we may be required to amortize significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and we may record significant amounts of goodwill that will be subject to annual testing for impairment 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to write off all or part of one or more of these investments that could harm our operating results 
if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be significantly diluted 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisitions could also cause operating margins to fall depending upon the financial models of the businesses acquired 
our strategic investments may involve joint development  joint marketing  or entry into new business ventures  or new technology licensing 
any joint development efforts may not result in the successful introduction of any new products by us or a third party  and any joint marketing efforts may not result in increased demand for our products 
further  any current or future strategic acquisitions and investments by us may not allow us to enter and compete effectively in new markets or enhance our business in our existing markets and we may have to write off our equity investments in companies as we have done in the past 
our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technologies 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce proprietary solutions for digital content and technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be challenged and invalidated or circumvented 
our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in all countries where products incorporating our technologies can be sold 
we have filed applications to expand our patent claims and for improvement patents to extend the current expiration dates  however  expiration of some of our patents may harm our business 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property  our business would be harmed 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies or design around our patents 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of processes and devices that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult  and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies 
such competitive threats could harm our business 

table of contents our ability to maintain and enforce our trademark rights has a large impact on our ability to prevent third party infringement of our brand and technologies and if we are unable to maintain and strengthen our brands  our business could be harmed 
maintaining and strengthening our brands is important to maintaining and expanding our business  as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our technologies and products 
if we fail to promote and maintain these brands successfully  our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter into new markets may suffer 
because we engage in relatively little direct brand advertising  the promotion of our brand depends  among other things  upon hardware device manufacturing partners displaying our trademarks on their products 
if these partners choose for any reason not to display our trademarks on their products  or if our partners use our trademarks incorrectly or in an unauthorized manner  the strength of our brand may be diluted or our ability to maintain or increase our brand awareness may be harmed 
we generally rely on enforcing our trademark rights to prevent unauthorized use of our brand and technologies 
our ability to prevent unauthorized uses of our brand and technologies would be negatively impacted if our trademark registrations were overturned in the jurisdictions where we do business 
our brand and logo are widely used by consumers and entities  both licensed and unlicensed  in association with digital video compression technology  and if we are not vigilant in preventing unauthorized or improper use of our trademarks  then our trademarks could become generic and we would lose our ability to assert such trademarks against others 
we also have trademark applications pending in a number of jurisdictions that may not ultimately be granted  or if granted  may be challenged or invalidated  in which case we would be unable to prevent unauthorized use of our brand and logo in such jurisdiction 
we have not filed trademark registrations in all jurisdictions where our brand and logo are used 
we may be subject to legal liability for the provision of third party products  services  content or advertising 
we periodically enter into arrangements to offer third party products  services  content or advertising under our brands or via distribution on our websites or in connection with our various products or service offerings 
for example  we license or incorporate certain entertainment metadata into our data offerings 
certain of these arrangements involve enabling the distribution of digital content owned by third parties  which may subject us to third party claims related to such products  services  content or advertising  including defamation  violation of privacy laws  misappropriation of publicity rights  violation of united states federal can spam legislation  and infringement of intellectual property rights 
we require users of our services to agree to terms of use that prohibit  among other things  the posting of content that violates third party intellectual property rights  or that is obscene  hateful or defamatory 
we have implemented procedures to enforce such terms of use on certain of our services  including taking down content that violates our terms of use for which we have received notification  or that we are aware of  and or blocking access by  or terminating the accounts of  users determined to be repeat violators of our terms of use 
despite these measures  we cannot guarantee that such unauthorized content will not exist on our services  that these procedures will reduce our liability with respect to such unauthorized third party conduct or content  or that we will be able to resolve any disputes that may arise with content providers or users regarding such conduct or content 
our agreements with these parties may not adequately protect us from these potential liabilities 
it is also possible that  if any information provided directly by us contains errors or is otherwise negligently provided to users  third parties could make claims against us  including  for example  claims for intellectual property infringement 
investigating and defending any of these types of claims is expensive  even if the claims do not result in liability 
if any of these claims results in liability  we could be required to pay damages or other penalties  which could harm our business and our operating results 
we may initiate patent infringement or patent interference actions or other litigation to protect our intellectual property  which could be costly and harm our business 
we are currently engaged in litigation  and litigation may be necessary in the future  to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 

table of contents we  and many of our current and potential competitors  dedicate substantial resources to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
we believe that companies will continue to take steps to protect their technologies  including  but not limited to  seeking patent protection 
companies in the technology and content related industries have frequently resorted to litigation regarding intellectual property rights 
disputes regarding the ownership of technologies and their associated rights are likely to arise in the future and we may be forced to litigate to determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights 
any such litigation could be very costly  could distract our management from focusing on operating our business  and might ultimately be unsuccessful 
the existence and or outcome of such litigation could harm our business 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other litigation  which are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
from time to time we receive claims and inquiries from third parties alleging that our internally developed technology  technology we have acquired or technology we license from third parties may infringe other third parties proprietary rights especially patents  including those relating to digital media standards such as mpeg  h  mp and aac 
third parties have also asserted and most likely will continue to assert claims against us alleging infringement of copyrights  trademark rights or other proprietary rights relating to video or music content  or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights 
we have faced such claims in the past  we currently face such claims  and we expect to face similar claims in the future 
regardless of the merits of such claims  any disputes with third parties over intellectual property rights could materially and adversely impact our business  including by resulting in the loss of management time and attention to our core business  the significant cost to defend ourselves against such claims or reducing the willingness of licensees to incorporate our technologies into their products 
additionally  we have also been asked by content owners to stop the display or hosting of copyrighted materials by our users or ourselves through our service offerings  including notices provided to us pursuant to the digital millennium copyright act 
we have and will promptly respond to legitimate takedown notices or complaints  including but not limited to those submitted pursuant to the digital millennium copyright act  notifying us that we are providing unauthorized access to copyrighted content by removing such content and or any links to such content from our websites 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that our prompt removal of content  including removal pursuant to the provisions of the digital millennium copyright act  will prevent disputes with content owners  that infringing content will not exist on our services  or that we will be able to resolve any disputes that may arise with content providers or users regarding such infringing content 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  or stop distributing our products or providing our services while we re engineer them or seek licenses to necessary technology  which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
we could also be subject to claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims made against our customers  strategic partners or the current owners of businesses that we divested  which could increase our defense costs and potential damages 
for example  we have received notices and lawsuits from certain customers requesting indemnification in patent related lawsuits 
we evaluate the requests and assess whether we believe we are obligated to provide such indemnification to such customers on a case by case basis 
customers or strategic partners making such requests could become unwilling or hesitant to do business with us if we decline such requests 
an adverse determination with respect to such requests or in any of these events described above could require us to change our business practices and have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  these types of disputes can be asserted by our licensees or prospective licensees or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief 
any disputes with our licensees or potential licensees or other third parties could harm our reputation and expose us to additional costs and other liabilities 
litigation could harm our business and result in substantial settlement or related costs  including indemnification of customers  diversion of management and technical resources  either our customers discontinuing to use or ourselves discontinuing to sell infringing products  
table of contents our expending significant resources to develop non infringing technology  and our obtaining licenses to infringed technology  which could be costly 
we are involved in the business of powering the discovery and enjoyment of digital entertainment  including over the internet 
there has been  and we believe that there will continue to be  an increasing level of litigation to determine the applicability of current laws to  and impact of new technologies on  the use and distribution of content over the internet and through new devices 
as we develop products and services that protect  provide or enable the provision of content in such ways  the risk of litigation against us may increase 
the effects of the global recession may impact our business  operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
the global recession has caused a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  and increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy 
additionally  sovereign budget crises among members of the european union and other countries worldwide have caused increased risk of default to holders of sovereign debt  including commercial banks  and an unprecedented risk about the continuing viability of the euro as a global currency 
these conditions have caused an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government  other foreign governments  central banks and quasi governmental agencies such as the international monetary fund  decreased consumer confidence  overall slower economic activity and extreme volatility in credit  equity and fixed income markets 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  these macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business  operating results  financial condition or liquidity in a number of ways 
for example  if the economic downturn makes it difficult for our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  they may delay  decrease or cancel purchases of our solutions or reduce production of their products 
as many of our solutions are licensed on a per unit fee basis  our customers decision to decrease production of their products or devices may decrease our licensing revenue and adversely impact our operating results 
furthermore  as our customers face a weak economy  they may not be able to gain sufficient credit in a timely manner  which could result in an impairment of their ability to place orders with us or to make timely payments to us for previous purchases 
if this occurs  our revenue may be reduced  thereby having a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  we may be forced to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding may increase  which would have a negative impact on our cash position  liquidity and financial condition 
we cannot predict the timing or the duration of this or any other economic downturn in the economy and we are not immune to the effects of general worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  financial institution failures may cause us to incur increased expenses or make it more difficult either to utilize our existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain financing for our operations  investing activities including the financing of any future acquisitions  or financing activities including an increase in our liability to counterparties under interest rate swap contracts and the timing and amount of any repurchases of our common stock or debt we may make in the future 
our investment portfolio  which includes short term debt securities  is generally subject to general credit  liquidity  counterparty  market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by the recent global financial crisis 
if the banking system or the fixed income  credit or equity markets deteriorated or remained volatile  our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected 
finally  like other stocks  our stock price can be affected by global economic uncertainties and if investors have concerns that our business  operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted by a worldwide economic downturn  our stock price could decrease 

table of contents we have indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position 
as of december   we had total debt with a par value of approximately  million which includes million of borrowings under our convertible notes 
on february   two of our subsidiaries  rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc  jointly borrowed million under a senior secured credit facility consisting of a year million term loan and a year million term loan 
both term loans are guaranteed by us and certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our  the subsidiary guarantors and the co borrowers assets 
the year term loan requires annual amortization payments and matures on february  and the year term loan requires quarterly amortization payments and matures on february  our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general business purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting its operations  many of which are beyond our control 
covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways and if we do not effectively manage our covenants  our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected 
on february   two of our subsidiaries  rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc  jointly borrowed million under a senior secured credit facility 
the senior secured credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability and or our restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons  issue redeemable preferred stock  pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase certain debt  make loans  investments and capital expenditures  enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries  sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and consolidate or merge with or into  or sell substantially all of our assets to  another person 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility contains restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may be unable to meet those ratios 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior secured credit facility and or our other indebtedness  which could in turn result in an acceleration of a substantial portion of our indebtedness 
in such event  we may be unable to repay all of the amounts that would become due under our indebtedness 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under our senior 
table of contents secured credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
in any case  if a significant portion of our debt was accelerated  we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  or to sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our credit agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets  use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and refinance our indebtedness 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
in addition  our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are  and are expected to continue to be  at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income would decrease 
repayment of debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their respective subsidiaries 
rovi corporation s subsidiaries  including rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc  own a significant portion of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations 
each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and  under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries 
in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries  we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the convertible notes 
accordingly  repayment of our indebtedness depends  to a significant extent  on the generation of cash flow by the subsidiaries  including rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc  the senior secured position of their bank debt  and their ability to make cash available to us  by dividend  debt repayment or otherwise 
because they are not guarantors or a co issuer of the convertible notes  our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on those notes or to make funds available for that purpose 
conversely  the ability of rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc to repay their indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility depends  in part  on the generation of cash flow by their respective subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries may not be able to  or may not be permitted to  make distributions to enable us  rovi solutions or rovi guides inc to make payments in respect of our indebtedness 
distributions from non us subsidiaries may be subject to foreign withholding taxes and us corporate tax and further reduce the net cash available for principal and interest payments 
despite our current level of indebtedness  we may still be able to incur more indebtedness 
this could increase the risks associated with our indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of our indentures do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness 
if we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with existing indebtedness  the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of our existing debt obligations in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency  
table of contents liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of us 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 
changes in  or interpretations of  tax rules and regulations  may adversely affect our effective tax rates 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws  by changes in the amount of revenue or earnings that we derive from international sources in countries with high or low statutory tax rates  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations 
in addition  federal  state  and foreign tax jurisdictions may examine our income tax returns  including income tax returns of acquired companies and acquired tax attributes included therein 
we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
in making such assessments  we exercise judgment in estimating our provision for income taxes 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination from these examinations will not be materially different from that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
any adverse outcome from these examinations may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
we may be subject to market risk and legal liability in connection with the data collection capabilities of our various online services 
many components of our online services include interactive components that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate 
to provide better consumer experiences and to operate effectively  we collect certain information from users 
collection and use of such information may be subject to united states state and federal privacy and data collection laws and regulations  standards used by credit card companies applicable to merchants processing credit card details  and foreign laws such as the eu data protection directive 
we post our privacy policies concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data  including that involved in interactions between client and server products 
any failure by us to comply with such posted privacy policies  any failure to comply with standards set by credit card companies relating to privacy or data collection  any failure to conform the privacy policy to changing aspects of our business or applicable law  or any existing or new legislation regarding privacy issues could impact the market for our online services  technologies and products and subject us to fines  litigation or other liability 
in addition  the children s online privacy protection act imposes civil and criminal penalties on persons collecting personal information from children under the age of we do not knowingly distribute harmful materials to minors  direct our websites or services to children under the age of  or collect personal information from children under the age of however  we are not able to control the ways in which consumers use our technology  and our technology may be used for purposes that violate this or other similar laws 
the manner in which such laws may be interpreted and enforced cannot be fully determined  and future legislation similar to this law could subject us to potential liability if we were deemed to be non compliant with such rules and regulations 
improper conduct by users could subject us to claims and compliance costs 
the terms of use and end user license agreements for our products and services prohibit a broad range of unlawful or undesirable conduct 
however  we are unable to block access in all instances to users who are determined to gain access to our products or services for improper motives 
claims may be threatened or brought against us using various legal theories based on the nature and content of information or media that may be created  posted online or generated by our users or the use of our technology 
this risk includes actions by our users to copy or distribute third party content 
investigating and defending any of these types of claims could be 
table of contents expensive  even if the claims do not ultimately result in liability 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs to enforce our terms of use or end user license agreements and to exclude certain users of our services or products who violate such terms of use or end user license agreements  or who otherwise engage in unlawful or undesirable conduct 
for our business to succeed  we need to attract and retain qualified employees and manage our employee base effectively 
our success depends on our ability to hire and retain qualified employees and to manage our employee base effectively 
because of the specialized nature of our business  our future success will depend upon our continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel  particularly as we enter new markets 
competition for people with the skills that we require is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters are located  and los angeles where we have significant operations  and the high cost of living in these areas makes our recruiting and compensation costs higher 
moreover  changes in our management or executive leadership team could lead to disruption of our business or distraction of our employees as the organization adapts to such management changes 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
establishing and maintaining licensing relationships with companies are important to build and support a worldwide entertainment technology licensing ecosystem and to expand our business  and failure to do so could harm our business prospects 
our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain licensing relationships with companies in related business fields  including semiconductor and equipment manufacturers  operators of entertainment content distributors  including ppv and vod networks  consumer electronics  digital ppv vod set top hardware manufacturers  dvd hardware manufacturers and pc manufacturers  content right holders  retailers and advertisers  drm suppliers  and internet portals and other digital distribution companies 
substantially all of our license agreements are non exclusive  and therefore our licensees are free to enter into similar agreements with third parties  including our competitors 
our licensees may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
some of our third party license arrangements require that we license others technologies and or integrate our solutions with others 
in addition  we rely on third parties to report usage and volume information to us 
delays  errors or omissions in this information could harm our business 
if these third parties choose not to support integration efforts or delay the integration of our solutions  our business could be harmed 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with a broad range of participants throughout the entertainment industry  including motion picture studios  broadcasters and manufacturers of ce products  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 
relationships have historically played an important role in the entertainment industries that we serve 
if we fail to maintain and strengthen these relationships  these entertainment industry participants may not purchase and use our technologies  which could materially harm our business and prospects 
in addition to directly providing a substantial portion of our revenue  these relationships 
table of contents are also critical to our ability to have our technologies adopted as industry standards 
moreover  if we fail to maintain our relationships  or if we are not able to develop relationships in new markets in which we intend to compete in the future  including markets for new technologies and expanding geographic markets  our business  operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if major industry participants form strategic relationships that exclude us  our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
it may be more difficult for us  in the future  to have our technologies adopted as individual industry standards if entertainment industry participants collaborate on the development of new or different industry standard technologies 
increasingly  standards setting organizations are adopting or establishing technology standards for use in a wide range of ce products 
as a result  it is more difficult for individual companies to have their technologies widely adopted as an informal industry standard 
in addition  there are a large number of companies  including companies that typically compete against one another  involved in the development of new technologies for use in consumer entertainment products 
as a result  these companies often license their collective intellectual property rights as a group  making it more difficult for any single company to have its technologies adopted widely as a de facto industry standard or to have its technologies adopted as an exclusive  explicit industry standard 
examples of this include mpeg la codecs and drm licensing  blu ray dvd high definition dvd format  and digital living network alliance dlna and the universal plug and play upnp forum interoperability of consumer electronics devices 
if our technologies are not supported by these standards bodies or patent pools  it may be more difficult for us to grow our business in the future 
our major customers may have a large influence on industry standards and the widespread adoption of new technologies 
the selection of alternative technologies to ours or to those on which our technologies operate would harm our business 
because many of our technologies  products and services are designed to comply with industry standards  to the extent we cannot distinguish our technologies  products and services from those sold by our competitors  our current distributors and customers may choose alternate technologies  products and services or choose to purchase them from multiple vendors 
we cannot provide any assurance that the industry standards for which we develop new technologies  products and services will allow us to compete effectively with companies possessing greater financial and technological resources than we have to market  promote and exploit sales opportunities as they arise in the future 
technologies  products and services that are designed to comply with standards may also be viewed as interchangeable commodities by certain customers 
we may be unable to compete effectively if we cannot produce technologies and products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
further  any new technologies  products and services developed may not be introduced in a timely manner or in advance of our competitors comparable offerings and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
because a portion of our revenue is generated through oem customers  sales of these technologies  products and services are tied to oem product sales 
a portion of the revenue attributable to the products acquired through the sonic acquisition is derived from sales through oem customers who either license the technologies  products and services and incorporate them into or bundle them with their products 
temporary fluctuations in the pricing and availability of the oem customers products could negatively impact sales of our technologies  products and services  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  sales of these technologies  products and services depend in large part on consumer acceptance and purchase of pcs and ce devices such as dvd players  bd players  dvd recorders  television sets  mobile handsets and other digital media devices marketed by our oem customers 
consumer acceptance of these oem products depends significantly on the 
table of contents price and ease of use of these devices  among other factors 
if the demand for these oem products is impaired  our oem sales may suffer a corresponding decline 
oem customers can be demanding with respect to the features they demand  as well as with respect to quality and testing requirements and economic terms 
because there are a relatively small number of significant oem customers  if they demand reduced prices  we may not be in a position to refuse such demands  which would adversely impact revenues and results of operations 
if particular oems demand technologies  products or services that we are unable to deliver  or if they impose higher quality requirements than we are able to satisfy  we could lose those relationships  which would adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
also  if our competitors offer their oem customers more favorable terms than we do or if our competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with oems  then these oems may not include our offerings with their products 
although we have maintained relationships with many of our oems for many years  if an oem agreement with a major customer were terminated and we were unable to replace such relationship or if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationship with oems  our business and results of operations would suffer 
the markets for our advertising platform  web services and rovi entertainment store may not develop and we may fail in our ability to fully exploit these new opportunities if these markets do not develop as we anticipate 
the market for advertising is at an early stage of development and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our efforts to develop our advertising platform as a medium widely accepted by consumers and advertisers 
in addition  mso  dbs and internet protocol television  or iptv  providers who have a patent license from us are not required to provide advertising  although many have 
therefore our ability to derive advertising revenues from our patent licensees is also dependent on the implementation of advertising by such licensees 
our rovi entertainment store is a white label service to companies that want to distribute  either in a sale or rental model  premium entertainment content directly to consumers using internet protocol for delivery 
there is no assurance that consumers will widely adopt the rovi entertainment store service or that it will become profitable 
online video distribution is a relatively new enterprise  and successful business models for delivering digital media over the internet are not fully tested 
we will invest significant time and money in building and organizing the premium content business  and its success could be jeopardized by difficulties in implementing and maintaining premium content information technology systems and infrastructure and or by increased operating expenses and capital expenditures required in connection with online premium content offerings 
because we have limited experience with online premium content offerings  we cannot assure you that it will be successful or profitable 
limitations on control of ipg inc may adversely impact our operations 
we hold a interest in ipg inc  as a joint venture with nonaffiliated third parties  which hold the remaining interest 
as a result of such arrangement  we may be unable to control the operations  strategies and financial decisions of ipg inc which could in turn result in limitations on our ability to implement strategies that we may favor  or to cause dividends or distributions to be paid 
in addition  our ability to transfer our interests in ipg inc may be limited under the joint venture arrangement 
consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry could adversely affect existing agreements 
we have entered into agreements with a large number of msos and dbs providers for the licensing or distribution of our technology  products and services 
if consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry continues  some of these agreements may be affected by mergers  acquisitions or system swaps which could result in an adverse effect on the amount of revenue we receive under these agreements 

table of contents we have limited control over existing and potential customers and licensees decisions to include our technology in their product offerings 
in general  we are dependent on our customers and licensees including producers and distributors of content for films and videos to incorporate our technology into their products 
although we have license agreements with many of these companies  many of these license agreements do not require any minimum purchase commitments  or are on a non exclusive basis  or do not require incorporation of our technology in their products 
if our customers were to determine that the benefits of our technology do not justify the cost of licensing the technology  then demand for our technology would decline 
furthermore  while we may be successful in having one or more industry standards setting organizations require that our technology be used in order for a product to be compliant with the standards promulgated by such organizations  there is no guarantee that products associated with these standards will be successful in the market 
our licensees and other manufacturers might not utilize our technology in the future 
if this were to occur  our business would be harmed 
our web based businesses  including rovi entertainment store  are vulnerable to third party operational problems and other risks 
we make certain of our products and services available through web based retail sites owned by third party resellers 
additionally  our rovi entertainment store provides technology and services used by third party resellers to operate their web based retail sites 
under these arrangements  either we or our reseller partners typically utilize co branded sites  provide the infrastructure to handle purchase transactions through secure web sites  and deliver the product whether via web download or physical fulfillment 
our web store operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware  software and service providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems  diversion of sales from other channels  rapid technological change  access to entertainment content for distribution through web stores including conditions and restrictions placed on the content distribution by the owners of such content  liability for online content  credit card and other online payment fraud  and issues relating to the use and protection of customer information 
we are subject to operating and certification rules and regulations by governments  payment card associations and payment processors  among others  which may change and make it more expensive  difficult or impossible for us to comply 
we rely on the third party resellers who operate these web stores for their smooth operation 
any interruption of these web stores could have a negative effect on our business 
if our web store resellers were to withdraw from this business or change their terms of service in ways that were unfavorable to us  there might not be a ready alternative outsourcing organization available  and we might be unprepared to assume operation of the web stores 
if any of these events occurs  our results of operations could be harmed 
qualifying  certifying and supporting our technologies  products and services is time consuming and expensive 
we devote significant time and resources to qualify and support our software products on various pc and ce platforms  including microsoft and apple operating systems 
in addition  we maintain high quality standards for products that incorporate our technologies and products through a quality control certification process 
to the extent that any previously qualified  certified and or supported platform or product is modified or upgraded  or we need to qualify  certify or support a new platform or product  we could be required to expend additional engineering time and resources  which could add significantly to our development expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
the success of certain of our solutions depends on the interoperability of our technologies with consumer hardware devices 
to be successful we design certain of our solutions to interoperate effectively with a variety of consumer hardware devices  including personal computers  dvd players and recorders  blu ray players  digital still 
table of contents cameras  digital camcorders  portable media players  digital tvs  home media centers  set top boxes  video game consoles  mp devices  multi media storage devices and mobile handsets 
we depend on significant cooperation with manufacturers of these devices and the components integrated into these devices  as well as software providers that create the operating systems for such devices  to incorporate certain of our technologies into their product offerings and ensure consistent playback of encoded files 
currently  a limited number of devices are designed to support our technologies 
if we are unsuccessful in causing component manufacturers  device manufacturers and software providers to integrate our technologies into their product offerings  our technologies may become less accessible to consumers  which would adversely affect our revenue potential 
some software we provide may be subject to open source licenses  which may restrict how we use or distribute our software or require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses 
some of the products we support and some of our proprietary technologies incorporate open source software such as open source mp codecs that may be subject to the lesser gnu public license or other open source licenses 
the lesser gnu public license and other open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the license be released or made available to the public 
such open source licenses typically mandate that software developed based on source code that is subject to the open source license  or combined in specific ways with such open source software  become subject to the open source license 
we take steps to ensure that proprietary software we do not wish to disclose is not combined with  or does not incorporate  open source software in ways that would require such proprietary software to be subject to an open source license 
however  few courts have interpreted the lesser gnu public license or other open source licenses  and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty 
we also take steps to disclose any source code for which disclosure is required under an open source license  but it is possible that we have or will make mistakes in doing so  which could negatively impact our brand or our adoption in the community  or could expose us to additional liability 
in addition  we rely on multiple software programmers to design our proprietary products and technologies 
although we take steps to ensure that our programmers both internal and outsourced do not include open source software in products and technologies we intend to keep proprietary  we cannot be certain that open source software is not incorporated into products and technologies we intend to keep proprietary 
in the event that portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license  or are intentionally released under an open source license  we could be required to publicly release the relevant portions of our source code  which could reduce or eliminate our ability to commercialize our products and technologies 
also  in relying on multiple software programmers to design products and technologies that we intend  or ultimately end up releasing in the open source community  we may discover that one or multiple such programmers have included code or language that would be embarrassing to us  which could negatively impact our brand or our adoption in the community  or could expose us to additional liability 
we depend on studios to license or make available content for certain of our services and formats 
our ability to provide our content delivery service depends on studios licensing content for online delivery 
the studios have great discretion whether to license their content  and the license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary by studio 
if studios change their terms and conditions  are no longer willing or able to provide us licenses  or if we are otherwise unable to obtain premium content on terms that are acceptable  the ability to provide our content delivery service will be adversely affected  which could harm our business and operating results 
in addition  a limited number of studios have agreed to make certain video content available in our media format but there is no assurance that we can enter into agreements with additional studios 
in the event that we fail to reach agreement with such studios  our format may become less compelling to consumers and to retailers and potentially to ce licensees 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate  which may cause us to not be able to sustain our revenue levels or rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis  which may cause our common stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we may not be able to sustain our revenue levels  or our rate of revenue growth  on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  we may be required to delay or extend recognition of revenue on more complex licensing arrangements as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
fluctuations in our operating results have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  the price of our common stock to decline 
other factors that could affect our operating results include the acceptance of our technologies by system operators and ce manufacturers  expenses related to  and the financial impact of  possible acquisitions of other businesses and the integration of such businesses  expenses related to  and the financial impact of  the dispositions of businesses  including post closing indemnification obligations  the timing and ability of signing high value licensing agreements during a specific period  the potential that we may not be in a position to anticipate a decline in revenues in any quarter until i late in the quarter due to the closing of sales agreements late in the quarter or ii after the quarter ends due to the delay inherent in reporting from certain licensees  the extent to which new content technologies or formats replace technologies to which our solutions are targeted  the pace at which our analog and older products sales decline compared to the pace at which our digital and new product revenues grow  and adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states or other major economies in which we do business as a result of the threat of terrorism  military actions taken by the united states or its allies  or generally weak and uncertain economic and industry conditions 
our quarterly operating results may also fluctuate depending upon when we receive royalty reports from certain licensees 
we recognize a portion of our license revenue only after we receive royalty reports from our licensees regarding the manufacture of their products that incorporate our technologies 
as a result  the timing of our revenue is dependent upon the timing of our receipt of those reports  some of which are not delivered until late in the quarter or after the end of the quarter 
this may put us in a position of not being able to anticipate a decline in revenues in any given quarter 
in addition  it is not uncommon for royalty reports to include corrective or retroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time 
furthermore  there have been times in the past when we have recognized an unusually large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee in a given quarter because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods 
this can result in a large amount of licensing revenue from a licensee being recorded in a given quarter that is not necessarily indicative of the amounts of licensing revenue to be received from that licensee in future quarters  thus causing fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sales 
economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with our international business or failure to manage our global operations effectively could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
as of december   we had major locations defined as a location with more than employees and employed employees outside the united states 
we face challenges inherent in efficiently managing 
table of contents employees over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  controls  policies  benefits and compliance programs 
our inability to successfully manage our global organization could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we expect that international and export sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future growth will depend to a large extent on worldwide acceptance and deployment of our solutions 
to the extent that foreign governments impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology or components from the united states  the demand for our solutions in these markets could diminish 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies 
such laws also may not be conducive to copyright protection of digital content  which may make our content protection technology less effective and reduce the demand for it 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including foreign government regulation  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  changes in  or imposition of  foreign laws and regulatory requirements and the costs of complying with such laws including consumer and data protection laws  changes in  or weakening of copyright and intellectual property patent laws  difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions or difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  import and export restrictions and duties  including tariffs  quotas or taxes and other trade barriers and restrictions  fluctuations in our net effective income tax rate driven by changes in the percentage of revenues that we derive from international sources  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic condition  including changes resulting from the threat of terrorism  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  including compliance with laws governing labor and employment  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our business could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop  if we do not receive additional orders to supply our technologies or products for use by foreign system operators  ce manufacturers and ppv vod providers or if regulations governing our international businesses change 
any changes to the statutes or the regulations with respect to export of encryption technologies could require us to redesign our products or technologies or prevent us from selling our products and licensing our technologies internationally 
we face risks with respect to conducting business in china due to china s historically limited recognition and enforcement of intellectual property and contractual rights and because of certain political  economic and social uncertainties relating to china 
in addition to other risks associated with our global business  we face risks due to the operations we conduct in china  which could be adversely affected by political  economic and social uncertainties in china 
as of 
table of contents december   we had employees in china  primarily carrying out research and development activities 
operations in china are subject to greater political  legal and economic risks than operations in other countries 
in particular  the political  legal and economic climate in china  both nationally and regionally  is fluid and unpredictable 
our ability to operate in china may be adversely affected by changes in chinese laws and regulations such as those related to  among other things  taxation  import and export tariffs  environmental regulations  land use rights  intellectual property  employee benefits and other matters 
in addition  we may not obtain or retain the requisite legal permits to continue to operate in china  and costs or operational limitations may be imposed in connection with obtaining and complying with such permits 
enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be sporadic and implementation and interpretation of laws inconsistent 
any of the foregoing could limit the remedies available in the event of any claims or disputes with third parties 
in addition  we have direct license relationships with many consumer hardware device manufacturers located in china and a number of the oems that license our technologies utilize captive or third party manufacturing facilities located in china 
we expect consumer hardware device manufacturing in china to continue to increase due to its lower manufacturing cost structure as compared to other industrialized countries 
as a result  we face additional risks in china  in large part due to china s historically limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights 
in particular  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  problems with china based consumer hardware device manufacturers underreporting or failing to report shipments of their products that incorporate our technologies  or incorporating our technologies or trademarks into their products without our authorization or without paying us licensing fees 
we may also experience difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights in china  where intellectual property rights are not as respected as they are in the united states  japan and europe 
unauthorized use of our technologies and intellectual property rights by china based consumer hardware device manufacturers may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
if we cannot adequately monitor the use of our technologies by china based consumer hardware device manufacturers  or enforce our intellectual property rights in china  our revenue could be adversely affected 
we have made and expect to make significant investments in infrastructure which  if ineffective  may adversely affect our business results 
we have made and expect to make significant investments in infrastructure  tools  systems  technologies and content  including initiatives relating to digital asset and rights management and data warehouses  aimed to create  assist in the development or operation of  or enhance our ability to deliver innovative products and services across multiple media  digital and emerging platforms 
these investments may ultimately cost more than is anticipated  their implementation may take longer than expected and they may not meaningfully contribute to or result in successful new or enhanced products  services or technologies 
some terms of our agreements with licensees could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect licensing revenue payable to us under those agreements 
some of our license agreements contain most favored nation clauses 
these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another licensee on more favorable terms  we must offer some of those terms to our existing licensees 
we have entered into a number of license agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements 
these agreements may obligate us to provide different  more favorable  terms to licensees  which could  if applied  result in lower revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation terms included in our license agreements  these contracts are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that  if correct  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents changes in the nature or level of customer support we provide customers of our technology  product and service offerings could cause us to defer the recognition of revenue  which could adversely impact our short term operating results 
our technologies  products and services contain advanced features and functionality that may require us to increase the levels of  or revise the nature of  our end user support 
our customers may also require us to provide various benefits over longer service terms 
to the extent that we offer a greater degree of customer support and ongoing services  we may be required to defer a greater percentage of revenues into future periods  which could harm short term operating results 
our products could be susceptible to errors  defects  or unintended performance problems that could result in lost revenues  liability or delayed or limited market acceptance 
we develop and offer complex solutions  which we license to customers 
the performance of these products typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
due to the complexity of these products  and despite our quality assurance testing  the products may contain undetected defects or errors that may affect the proper use or application of such products by the customer 
because our products are embedded in digital content and other software  our solutions performance could unintentionally jeopardize our customers product performance 
any such defects  errors  or unintended performance problems in existing or new products  and any inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner  could result in loss of revenue or market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs and increased service costs  any of which could materially harm our business 
in addition  we rely on customers and third party replicators to properly use our products to protect the software and applications to which our technology may be applied 
any improper use or application of the software by customers or third party replicators may render our technologies useless and result in losses from claims arising out of such improper use of the products 
because customers rely on our products as used in their software and applications  defects or errors in our products may discourage customers from purchasing our products 
these defects or errors could also result in product liability or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from these claims through warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability clauses in our agreements  these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance 
furthermore  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance may not adequately cover these claims 
if a court refused to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  our business could be materially harmed 
in protecting copyrights and other intellectual property rights of our customers  our products affect consumer use of our customers products 
consumers may view this negatively and discontinue or threaten to discontinue purchase or use of our customers products unless our customers stop using our technologies 
this may cause a decline in demand for our products or legal actions against us by our customers or consumers 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to pervasive federal regulation  including fcc licensing and other requirements 
these industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
while these regulations do not apply directly to us  they affect cable television providers and other multi channel video programming distributors  or mvpds  which are the primary customers for certain of our products and services 
fcc regulations prohibit mvpds except dbs providers from deploying after july   consumer electronic navigation devices eg  set top boxes with combined security and non security functions the integration ban 
the fcc has granted a number of requests for waiver 
table of contents of the integration ban  and denied several petitions for waivers or deferrals 
petitions for reconsideration of the decisions denying waivers are pending before the fcc 
further developments with respect to these issues or other related fcc action could impact the availability and or demand for plug and play devices  including set top boxes  all of which could affect demand for ipgs incorporated in set top boxes or ce devices and correspondingly affect our license fees 
legislative initiatives seeking to weaken copyright law or new governmental regulation or new interpretation of existing laws that cause resulting legal uncertainties could harm our business 
consumer rights advocates and other constituencies continuously challenge copyright law  notably the us digital millennium copyright act of  or dmca  through both legislative and judicial actions 
legal uncertainties surrounding the application of the dmca may adversely affect our business 
if copyright law is compromised  or devices that can circumvent our technology are permitted by law and become prevalent  this could result in reduced demand for our technologies  and our business would be harmed 
many laws and regulations are pending and may be adopted in the united states  individual states and local jurisdictions and other countries with respect to the internet 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including copyright and other intellectual property rights  digital rights management  property ownership and taxation 
these types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulations 
in addition  state and local governments may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
changes to or the interpretation of these laws could increase our costs  expose us to increased litigation risk  substantial defense costs and other liabilities or require us or our customers to change business practices 
it is not possible to predict whether or when such legislation may be adopted  and the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  could materially and adversely affect our business 
business interruptions could adversely affect our future operating results 
the provision of certain of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of communications and transmission systems and mechanisms  including satellite  cable  wire  over the air broadcast communications and transmission systems and mechanisms 
these communication and transmission systems and mechanisms are subject to significant risks and any damage to or failure of these systems and mechanisms could result in an interruption of the provision of our products and services 
several of our major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake  fire  power shortages  terrorist attacks and other hostile acts  and other events beyond our control 
the majority of our research and development activities  our corporate headquarters  our principal information technology systems  and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man made disaster that disrupts our business 
the communications and transmission systems and mechanisms that we depend on are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities 
if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls  our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired  which could increase our operating costs and affect our ability to operate our business 
we have a complex business that is international in scope 
ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help ensure that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be re evaluated frequently 
we are continually in the process of documenting  reviewing and  if appropriate  improving our internal controls and 
table of contents procedures in connection with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accountants on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
if we or our independent registered public accountants identify areas for further attention or improvement  implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors  officers and employees  entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems  and take a significant period of time to complete 
we have in the past identified  and may in the future identify  significant deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal controls  which have been or will in the future need to be remediated 
furthermore  our independent registered public accountants may interpret the section requirements and the related rules and regulations differently from how we interpret them  or our independent registered public accountants may not be satisfied with our internal control over financial reporting or with the level at which these controls are documented  operated or reviewed in the future 
finally  in the event we make a significant acquisition  or a series of smaller acquisitions  we may face significant challenges in implementing the required processes and procedures in the acquired operations 
as a result  our independent registered public accountants may decline or be unable to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting or may issue a qualified report in the future 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to investors perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements 
we will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant legal  accounting and other expenses associated with corporate governance and public company reporting requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules implemented by the sec and nasdaq 
as long as the sec requires the current level of compliance for public companies of our size  we expect these rules and regulations to require significant legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities time consuming and costly 
these rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage than was previously available 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
we may be subject to assessment of sales and other taxes for the sale of our products  license of technology or provision of services 
we generally do not collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our products  license of technology or provision of services in states and countries other than those in which we have offices or employees 
our business would be harmed if one or more states or any foreign country required us to collect sales or other taxes from past sales of products  licenses of technology or provision of services  particularly because we would be unable to go back to customers to collect sales taxes for past sales and would likely have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of technical innovations  new products or new contracts  announcements by competitors or their customers  
table of contents announcements by our customers  governmental regulatory and copyright action  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  announcements regarding acquisitions or divestitures  announcements regarding litigation or regulatory matters  changes in financial estimates or coverage by securities analysts  changes in interest rates which affect the value of our investment portfolio  changes in tax law or the interpretation of tax laws  and general market conditions 
announcements by satellite television operators  cable television operators  major content providers or others regarding ce business combinations  evolving industry standards  consumer rights activists wins in government regulations or the courts  motion picture production or distribution or other developments could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
there can be no assurance that our historic trading prices  or those of technology companies in general  will be sustained 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  some companies have been named in class action suits 
further  the general stock market instability and economic uncertainty may adversely affect the global financial markets  which could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
our telephone and computer networks are subject to security and stability risks that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to litigation or liability 
online business activities depend on the ability to transmit confidential information and licensed intellectual property securely over private and public networks 
any compromise of our ability to transmit such information and data securely or reliably  and any costs associated with preventing or eliminating such problems  could harm our business 
online transmissions are subject to a number of security and stability risks  including our own or licensed encryption and authentication technology  and access and security procedures  may be compromised  breached or otherwise be insufficient to ensure the security of customer information or intellectual property  we could experience unauthorized access  computer viruses  system interference or destruction  denial of service attacks and other disruptive problems  whether intentional or accidental  that may inhibit or prevent access to our websites or use of our products and services  someone could circumvent our security measures and misappropriate our  our partners or our customers proprietary information or content or interrupt operations  or jeopardize our licensing arrangements  which are contingent on our sustaining appropriate security protections  our computer systems could fail and lead to service interruptions or downtime for our ecommerce websites  or we may need to grow  reconfigure or relocate our data centers in response to changing business needs  which may be costly and lead to unplanned disruptions of service 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business  hurt our ability to distribute products and services and collect revenue  threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology  harm 
table of contents our reputation  and expose us to litigation or liability 
because some of our technologies and businesses are intended to inhibit use of or restrict access to our customers intellectual property  we may become the target of hackers or other persons whose use of or access to our customers intellectual property is affected by our technologies 
we may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches  hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  attacks or failures 
our internet based product and service offerings rely on a variety of systems  networks and databases  many of which are maintained by us at our data centers 
we do not have complete redundancy for all of our systems  and we do not maintain real time back up of our data  so in the event of significant system disruption  particularly during peak periods  we could experience loss of data processing capabilities  which could cause us to lose customers and could harm our operating results 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect against down time for products and services  we do occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties 
in order to provide our internet based products and services  we must protect the security of our systems  networks  databases and software 
we utilize non gaap reporting in our quarterly earnings press releases 
we publish non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases along with a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to those measures compiled in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the reconciling items have adjusted gaap net income and gaap earnings per share for certain non cash  non operating or non recurring items and are described in detail in each such quarterly earnings press release 
we believe that this presentation may be more meaningful to investors in analyzing the results of operations and income generation as this is how our business is managed 
the market price of our stock may fluctuate based on future non gaap results if investors base their investment decisions upon such non gaap financial measures 
if we decide to curtail use of non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases  the market price of our stock could be affected if investors analyze our performance in a different manner

item legal proceedings the company is involved in legal proceedings related to intellectual property rights and other matters 
the following legal proceedings include those of the company and its subsidiaries 
indemnifications directv  inc v 
finisar corporation 
in april  gemstar received a notice of a potential claim for indemnification from directv group  inc directv as a result of a lawsuit filed by finisar corporation finisar against directv in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
finisar alleged that several aspects of the directv satellite transmission system  including aspects of its advanced electronic program guide epg and the storage  scheduling  and transmission of data for the epg  infringed a finisar patent 
on july   the court awarded finisar approximately million 
in addition  the court ordered directv to pay approximately per activated set top box in licensing fees going forward in lieu of an injunction until the expiration of finisar s patent in the parties both filed appeals to the federal circuit  which subsequently ruled that the trial court s construction of certain terms of the patent was too broad  vacated the jury s verdict of infringement  held that one of the seven patent claims at issue is invalid  and left standing the remaining six claims for reconsideration by the trial court 
the appeals court also reversed the jury s finding that directv s infringement was willful 
the trial court subsequently ruled in directv s favor on its summary judgment motion that the remaining claims of the subject patent were invalid  and in january  the court of appeals confirmed that ruling 
the company has not established a reserve with respect to this matter in its consolidated financial statements 
comcast cable communications corp  llc v 
finisar corporation  in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
in support of a potential claim for indemnification  comcast cable communications corp  llc comcast put the company on notice that it had received communications from finisar asserting infringement of us patent  the patent 
on july   comcast filed a declaratory judgment action in the northern district of california asking the court to rule  among other things  that it does not infringe the patent and or that the patent is invalid 
on may   finisar entered into a covenant and stipulation with comcast  filed with the california court  that it would not assert any claim of the patent against comcast or certain related entities  other than claim on july   the court ruled on comcast s summary judgment motion  finding that claim is invalid  and therefore finding that comcast s non infringement motion is moot 
comcast has not taken any further action insofar as its potential indemnity claim against the company is concerned

this increase was primarily due to million in revenue from the addition of the acquired sonic products and increases in ipg patent and product revenue  primarily due to new agreements signed in the current year 
these increases were partially offset by the continued decline in acp revenue 
going forward  we anticipate increases in sales of our digital products  as well as licensing of our patents to ce manufacturers  to be offset by continued declines in our revenue from analog products such as acp 
service providers revenue for the year ended december   revenue from service providers increased by compared to the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in ipg product revenues which benefited from continued domestic digital subscriber growth and rate increases on renewed agreements 
also contributing to the 
table of contents growth was an increase in ipg advertising revenue

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  equity based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our continuing business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition on january   we adopted accounting standards update  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable arrangements  asu and accounting standards update  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu modifies the requirements for determining whether a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement can be treated as a separate unit of accounting by removing the criteria that objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements 
the new guidance requires consideration be allocated to all deliverables based on their relative selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise selling price is determined based on third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe exist  management must use its best estimate of selling price esp to allocate the arrangement consideration 
we adopted this update under the prospective method and have applied the guidance to agreements entered into or materially modified after january  the adoption of asu may have a material impact on our revenue in any given period subsequent to adoption 
for example  at times  we enter into ipg patent license agreements in which we provide a licensee a release for past infringement as well as the right to ship an unlimited number of units over a set period for a flat 
table of contents fee 
under the previous multiple element guidance  we generally would not be able to provide objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the go forward license arrangement the undelivered element and therefore would have recognized all revenue for such agreement ratably over the term of the agreement 
applying the guidance in the update  we would use esp to allocate the consideration between the release for past infringement and the go forward patent license 
as the revenue recognition criteria for the past infringement would generally be satisfied upon the execution of the agreement  the amount of consideration allocated to the past infringement would be recognized in the quarter the agreement is executed and the amount allocated to the go forward license agreement would be recognized ratably over the term 
asu excludes tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of asc  software revenue recognition 
we adopted asu on a prospective basis and applied the new guidance to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonable assured 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered and whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe  tpe or esp  as applicable  and allocate the total consideration among the various elements based on the relative selling price method 
we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives given to our customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue  rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that is separate from the customer s purchase and for which we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
ce and service provider licensing we license our proprietary ipg technology  codec technology and acp technology to ce manufacturers  integrated circuit makers  service providers and others 
we generally recognize revenue from licensing our technology on a per unit shipped model with ce manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our recognition of revenues from per unit license fees is based on units reported shipped by the manufacturer 
ce manufacturers normally report their unit shipments to us in the quarter immediately following that of actual shipment by the licensee 
we have established significant experience and relationships with certain acp technology licensing customers to reasonably estimate current period volume for purposes of making a revenue accrual 
accordingly  revenue from these customers is recognized in the period the customer ships the units 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the period the services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
revenues from annual or other license fees are recognized based on the specific terms of the license arrangement 
for instance  some of our large ce ipg and codec technology licensees have entered into agreements for which they have the right to ship an unlimited number of units over a specified term for a flat fee 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
at times  we enter into ipg patent license agreements in which we provide a licensee a release for past infringement as well as the right to ship an unlimited number of units over a future period for a flat fee 
in this type of arrangement  we generally would use esp to allocate the consideration between the release for past infringement and the go forward patent license 
as the revenue recognition criteria for the past infringement would generally be satisfied upon the execution of the agreement  the amount of consideration allocated to the 
table of contents past infringement would be recognized in the quarter the agreement is executed and the amount allocated to the go forward license agreement would be recognized ratably over the term 
in addition  we also enter into agreements in which the licensee pays us a one time fee for a perpetual license to our acp technology 
provided that collectability is reasonably assured  we record revenue related to these agreements when the agreement is executed as we have no continuing obligation and the amounts are fixed and determinable 
we also generate advertising revenue through our ipgs and other platforms 
advertising revenue is recognized when the related advertisement is provided 
all advertising revenue is recorded net of agency commissions and revenue shares with service providers and ce manufacturers 
rovi entertainment store video delivery solution we recognize service fees we receive from retailers and others for operating their storefronts on a straight line basis over the period we are providing services 
we recognize transaction revenue from the sale or rental of individual content titles in the period when the content is purchased and delivered 
transaction revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are the principal in the transaction and is recorded net of payments to content owners and others when we are acting as an agent 
we are generally the principal when we are the merchant of record and are the licensor of the content offered through the storefront 
discontinued opertions roxio consumer software products except in the case of consignment arrangements  we recognize revenue from the sale of packaged software products when title transfers to the distributor or retailer 
when we sell packaged software products to distributors and retailers on a consignment basis  we recognize revenue upon sell through to an end customer 
our distributor arrangements often provide distributors with certain product rotation rights 
we estimate returns based on our historical return experience and other factors such as channel inventory levels and the introduction of new products 
these allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenues and as an offset to accounts receivable to the extent we have legal right of offset  otherwise they are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
if future returns patterns differ from past returns patterns  for example due to reduced demand for our products  we may be required to increase these allowances in the future and may be required to reduce future revenues 
we also license our software to oems who include it with the pcs they sell 
we generally receive a per unit royalty and recognize this revenue upon receipt of the customer royalty report 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation  and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our trade receivables by aging category to identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues 
for accounts not specifically identified  we provide reserves based on historical bad debt loss experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
equity based compensation we determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the black scholes option pricing model which uses a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include 
table of contents our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using a combination of historical volatility and implied volatility in market traded options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our equity based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our equity based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those equity based payments in the future 
certain equity based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
classification and fair value measurement of auction rate securities we hold investments in auction rate securities having contractual maturities of greater than one year and interest rate reset features of between and days 
these auction rate securities were priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature 
as a result of adverse conditions in the financial markets  the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
the fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model rather than at par 
these analyses are highly judgmental and consider  among other items  the likelihood of redemption  credit quality  duration  insurance wraps and expected future cash flows 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
temporary declines in fair value for our available for sale auction rate securities  which we attribute to market liquidity issues rather than credit issues  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
any future fluctuation in fair value related to these instruments that we deem to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we determine that any future valuation adjustment is other than temporary  we will record a charge to earnings as appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
on october   we adopted accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topics topic asu 
asu allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to the determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis performed annually in our fourth quarter  we are required to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
to accomplish this  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to the determination that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we perform the two step impairment test 
the first step of the two step impairment analysis is to determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach and a market based approach 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment analysis  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent the implied fair value of goodwill of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts and discount rates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and would no longer be depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
from time to time  we enter into transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty 
in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes  we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination  based on their technical merits 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amount provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements

on february   two of our subsidiaries  rovi solutions corporation and rovi guides inc  jointly borrowed million under a senior secured credit facility consisting of a year million term loan term loan a and a year million term loan term loan b 
both term loans are guaranteed by us and certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and security investments 
changes in these factors may cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage the exposure to these market risks as follows fixed income investments 
we have an investment portfolio of money market funds and fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  short term investments and long term marketable investment securities of million as of december  most of these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities while a decrease in interest rates could adversely affect the amount of interest income we receive 
our investment portfolio consists principally of money market mutual funds  us treasury and agency securities  corporate bonds  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
we regularly monitor the credit risk in our investment portfolio and take appropriate measures to manage such risks prudently in accordance with our investment policies 
as a result of adverse conditions in the financial markets  auction rate securities may present risks arising from liquidity and or credit concerns 
at december   the fair value of our auction rate securities portfolio 
table of contents totaled approximately million 
our auction rate securities portfolio is comprised solely of aaa rated federally insured student loans  municipal and educational authority bonds 
the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade for over one year due to insufficient bids from buyers 
this limits the short term liquidity of these securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk  however  by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
the primary objective of these policies is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields  without significantly increasing risk 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our fixed income available for sale securities as of december  while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity  we believe that our investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the risks in our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rates 
due to our reliance on international and export sales  we are subject to the risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a substantial majority of our international and export revenues  as well as expenses  are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
many of our subsidiaries operate in their local currency  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to the respective currency collected 
indebtedness 
we have convertible notes with a par value of million 
in february  two of our subsidiaries jointly borrowed million under a senior secured credit facility 
our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are  and are expected to continue to be  at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same 
the terms of these debt instruments are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swaps and caps 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million under which we pay a weighted average floating rate of month usd libor minus  set in arrears  and receive a fixed rate of 
in november  we entered into additional swaps with a notional amount of million under which we pay a fixed rate which gradually increases from for the six month settlement period ending in february  to for the six month settlement period ending in february and receive a floating rate of month usd libor minus  set in arrears 
these swaps expire in february in october  we entered into additional swaps with a notional amount of million 
these swaps have an effective date of june  and under these swaps we pay a fixed interest rate which gradually increases from for the three month settlement period ending september  to for the final settlement period ending january and receive a floating rate of usd libor bba 
these swaps expire in january
