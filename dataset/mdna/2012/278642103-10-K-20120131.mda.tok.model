item a risk factors risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  as well as the trading price of our common stock

publicity about fraud  spoofing  phishing  viruses  spyware  malware and other dangers  and macroeconomic and geopolitical events affecting commerce generally 
it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance 
we do not have backlog  and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter 
due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues  it is also difficult to forecast income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
quarterly and annual income statement expenses as a percentage of net revenues may be significantly different from historical or projected rates 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline 
we invest heavily in technology  marketing and promotion  customer support  protection programs and further development of the operating infrastructure for our core and non core operations 
some of this investment entails long term contractual commitments 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  which may harm our profitability 
growth rates of our marketplaces businesses in some of our most established markets have been slower than that for ecommerce generally and have declined in certain periods 
the growth of internet users is slowing in many countries where we have a significant presence 
despite our efforts to stem our loss of share in these and other markets  we may not be successful 
as our growth rates in established markets slow  we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing users  especially our top buyers and sellers  active and increasing their activity level on our websites in order to continue to grow our business 
the growth of internet users is accelerating in some countries and regions where we do not have a significant presence eg  brazil latin america  russia  china and certain developing countries in which we do not have a meaningful or  in some cases  any domestic business  and our failure to establish our businesses and drive adoption of our services in such markets would negatively impact our future growth 
our marketplaces business is facing increased competitive pressure 
in particular  the competitive norm for  and the expected level of service from  internet ecommerce websites has significantly increased  due to  for example  improved user experience  greater ease of buying goods  lower or no shipping costs  faster shipping times and more favorable return policies 
if we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce marketplace  particularly the higher growth of sales of fixed price items and higher service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms  our business will suffer 
we have announced changes to our marketplaces business that are intended to drive more sales and improve seller efficiency and buyer experiences 
for example  in the us  the us and canada  we may request that paypal place temporary holds on seller funds in certain instances eg  for sellers with a limited selling history or below standard performance ratings  which is intended to help improve seller performance and increase buyer satisfaction 
we have also recently implemented a new payment process in germany and austria in which buyers pay ebay directly for items purchased from newly registered sellers on our localized websites in those countries  and ebay subsequently pays the seller subject to confirmation that the item has shipped 
we may expand the scope of such programs in the future and introduce and implement additional programs with similar aims in different businesses and geographies 
some of the changes that we have announced to date have been controversial with  and led to dissatisfaction among  our sellers  and additional changes that we announce in the future may also be negatively received by some of our sellers 
this may not only impact the supply of items listed on our websites  but because many sellers also buy from our sites  it may adversely impact demand as well 
given the number of recent changes that we have made to our policies and pricing  it may take our sellers some time to fully assess and adjust to these changes  and sellers may elect to reduce volume on our sites while making such assessments and adjustments or in response to these changes 
if any of these changes cause sellers to move their business in whole or in part away from our websites or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings  our operating results and profitability will be harmed 
we believe that the mix of sales under our traditional auction style listing format and fixed price listing format will continue to shift towards our fixed price format 
accordingly  we have eliminated some of the features related to our traditional auction style format and expect others will continue to become less meaningful to  and used less frequently by  our sellers  resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues from those features 
we also expect that the costs associated with our seller discount programs will increase as more sellers become eligible for such discounts 
in addition  because a large percentage of paypal transactions originate on the ebay platform  declines in growth rates in major marketplaces markets also adversely affect paypal s growth 
the expected future growth of our paypal  gsi  stubhub and our other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross margins than our marketplaces platforms 
the sluggish economy could harm our business 
our marketplaces  payments and gsi ecommerce services businesses are dependent on consumer purchases  and our gsi business is also impacted by the offline businesses of our gsi clients 
the economic downturn resulted in reduced buyer demand and reduced selling prices and the slow recovery may reduce the volume of purchases on our marketplaces platforms and the volume of transactions paid for using our payment services and the online and offline businesses of our gsi clients  any of which would adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
because we conduct the majority of our business outside the united states but report our financial results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
in connection with its multi currency service  paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day  and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or if exposure reports are delayed 
given that paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in non us currencies  its financial results are affected by the translation of these non us currencies into us dollars 
in addition  the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenues  operating expenses and net income 
similarly  if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  our translation of foreign currency denominated transactions will result in lower net revenues  operating expenses and net income 
if the us dollar continues to strengthen against major european currencies eg  the euro and british pound whether because of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe or worsening economic conditions  our revenues and operating results would be adversely impacted 
for the year ended december   foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar positively impacted net revenues of billion by approximately million net of a million negative impact from hedging activities relating to paypal s net revenue compared to the prior year 
as exchange rates vary  net revenues and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from expectations 
in particular  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  british pound  korean won  australian dollar or canadian dollar  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments 
while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure  it is impossible to predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure 
in addition  to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro  the british pound  the australian dollar or other currencies  cross border trade related to purchases of dollar denominated goods or goods from asia pacific countries whose currencies tend to follow the dollar by non us purchasers will likely decrease  and that decrease will likely not be offset by a corresponding increase in cross border trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies  which would adversely affect our business 
in addition  we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
relatively low interest rates have continued to limit our investment income  including income we earn on paypal customer balances 
bill me later s operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender 
in november  we acquired bill me later  a company that facilitates credit services offered by an unaffiliated bank 
bill me later is neither a chartered financial institution nor is it licensed to make loans in any state 
accordingly  bill me later must rely on a bank or licensed lender to issue the bill me later credit products and extend credit to customers to offer the bill me later service 
currently  when a consumer makes a purchase using a bill me later credit product  the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer  funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant 
we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the extensions of credit made by the chartered financial institution and  as a result of the purchase  bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults 
although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account  we own the related receivable and bill me later is responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 
in september  webbank became the issuer of the bill me later credit products 
webbank is an industrial bank chartered by the state of utah 
any termination or interruption of webbank s ability to lend could result in our being unable to originate any new transactions for the bill me later service  which would require us to either reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or to obtain our own bank charter  which would be a time consuming and costly process and would subject us to a number of additional laws and regulations  compliance with which would likely be burdensome 
a lawsuit has been filed against bill me later  paypal and ebay in the us district court for the northern district of california  alleging that in its relationship with the chartered financial institution  bill me later is acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various california laws  including the state s usury law 
the court dismissed the usury claims in december  but breach of contract and other claims remain 
webbank requested to intervene in the action and has been added as a party to the action  and in october  the court transferred the case to the us district court for the district of utah 
we believe that these allegations are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  this area of law is uncertain and if the lawsuit is successful  bill me later may be required to change its methods of operations  pay substantial damages and reduce some of its charges and fees  which would likely adversely affect our business 
if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfers  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  sanctions  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
our payments business is subject to various laws and regulations in the us and other countries where it operates  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfers  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  sanctions  banking and lending 
the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our payments business vary in the markets where we operate 
while paypal has a compliance program focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and has significantly increased the resources of that program in the last several years  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to fines or other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions or be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs to comply in the future 
while paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from markets  paypal only allows customers in of those markets including the us to receive payments  in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds 
these limitations may affect paypal s ability to grow in these markets 
of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service  countries plus four french overseas departments are members of the european union  or eu 
since  paypal has provided localized versions of its service to customers in the eu through paypal europe s 
rl et cie  sca  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg 
accordingly  paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  funds management  corporate governance  sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks 
any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the luxembourg regulator could adversely affect paypal s business 
paypal europe implements its localized services in eu countries through a passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives  and has completed the passport notification process in all eu member countries 
the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that will apply to its business  in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law  and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office 
these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of  or delay  paypal s plans for expanding its business in eu countries 
in addition  national interpretations of regulations implementing the eu payments service directive  which established a new regulatory regime for payment services providers  may be inconsistent  which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage 
in australia  paypal serves its customers through paypal australia pty 
ltd  which is licensed by the australian prudential regulatory authority as a purchased payment facility provider  which is a type of authorized depository institution 
accordingly  paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions 
in china  paypal is affiliated with shanghai wangfuyi information technology ltd  which is licensed as an internet content provider and operates a payments service only for chinese customers and only for transactions denominated in chinese currency 
the people s bank of china pboc has recently enacted regulations to establish a new type of license  called a payment settlement organization pso license  which will be required for non bank payment services 
the pboc regulations leave unclear whether a foreign owned company such as paypal can control or invest in a payment settlement organization  and whether wangfuyi or paypal s wholly owned subsidiary in china would be eligible to obtain a pso license 
to date  paypal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in us states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
paypal is also licensed as an escrow agent in one us state 
paypal is applying for money transmitter licenses in five additional states to facilitate its planned offering of payment services at the retail point of sale 
the two remaining us states do not currently regulate money transmitters 
as a licensed money transmitter  paypal is subject to restrictions on its investment of customer funds  reporting requirements  bonding requirements  and inspection by state regulatory agencies 
if paypal were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations  paypal could be subject to liability and or additional restrictions eg  liquidity requirements  forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states  forced to change its business practices  or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal 
any change to paypal s business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could also decrease the velocity of trade on ebay and websites operated by gsi s clients that accept paypal as a form of payment  which would further harm our business 
paypal s california regulator  the california department of financial institutions dfi  recently notified paypal that paypal s current practice of holding the funds underlying us customer balances as an agent on behalf of its customers  rather than as owner of those funds  causes paypal to be in violation of the liquidity rules applicable to california money transmitter licensees 
paypal has established this current practice in part to maintain potential eligibility of those funds for pass through federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage when those funds are placed in us bank accounts 
paypal has requested the dfi to grant a waiver that would allow paypal to continue to hold those funds as an agent or custodian on behalf of customers and still qualify those funds as liquid assets 
if a waiver is not granted  paypal would have to change these arrangements to hold the funds directly 
this would likely disqualify the funds from pass through fdic insurance  and could also result in decreased revenue to paypal if it decides to shift the funds from bank accounts to securities that bear lower interest rates 
any potential decrease in revenue to paypal resulting from this change is not expected to be material 
this would also result in these funds  which are currently not reported as assets owned by paypal on our consolidated balance sheet  moving onto our consolidated balance sheet along with the accompanying liabilities 
for additional information  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   these funds totaled approximately billion 
in markets other than the us  the eu  australia  the china domestic business and brazil  paypal serves its customers through paypal private ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of paypal that is based in singapore 
paypal private ltd 
is regulated in singapore as a stored value issuer 
in many of these markets  it is not clear whether paypal s singapore based service is subject only to singaporean law or  if it were subject to local laws  whether such local law would require a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise 
in such markets  the business may rely on partnerships with local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency 
local regulators who do not have direct jurisdiction over singapore based paypal private ltd 
may use their local regulatory power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local banking partner 
such regulatory actions impacting local banking partner arrangements could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of paypal services in that market  or could prevent paypal from providing any services in a given market 
the reserve bank of india has asserted that paypal s offering of payment services to customers outside of india to send personal  non commercial payments to recipients in india requires a license from the reserve bank 
for a period of time in  the reserve bank directed the indian affiliate of paypal s processing bank to suspend withdrawals to the indian bank accounts of paypal customers for both personal and business customers 
paypal has ended personal non commercial payments to and from indian accounts and the ability of indian sellers to spend payments they receive  and has also stopped offering certain commercial payments between indian buyers and indian sellers 
in november  the reserve bank of india issued guidelines to indian banks on the requirements for processing export related transactions for online payment gateway service providers such as paypal  including a limitation on the amount of individual transactions to no more than increased in october to 
the reserve bank may again impose a suspension if it is not satisfied with paypal s and its partner bank s actions to comply with these guidelines 
in the event of any non compliance  paypal could be subject to fines from the reserve bank  and paypal s prospects for future business in india  both cross border and domestic  could be materially and adversely affected 
even if paypal is not currently required to be licensed in some jurisdictions  future localization or targeted marketing of paypal s service or expansion of the financial products offered by paypal whether alone  through a commercial alliance or through an acquisition in those countries could subject paypal to additional licensure requirements  laws and regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny  any of which may harm paypal s business 
for example  paypal expects it will be required to obtain licenses in japan and russia to expand its services in those countries 
there can be no assurance that paypal will be able to obtain such licenses 
even if paypal were able to obtain such licenses  there would be substantial costs involved in maintaining such licenses  and paypal would be subject to fines or other enforcement action if it violates disclosure  reporting  anti money laundering  capitalization  corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses 
these factors could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of paypal s products 
delay or failure to receive such a license or regulatory approval could require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypal s expansion plans  and force paypal to suspend providing products and services to customers in one or more countries 
paypal is also subject to various anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit  among other things  its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities 
paypal is focused on compliance with these laws and regulations and has programs designed to comply with new and existing legal and regulatory requirements 
however  any errors  failures or delays in complying with federal  state or foreign money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits  penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions 
in the united states  paypal is subject to regulations that require it to report  within required timeframes  suspicious activities involving transactions of  or more  and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of  or more 
new regulations on prepaid access programs which take full effect in march will require paypal to take additional steps to verify the identity of customers who pre fund a paypal balance 
us regulators have increased scrutiny of compliance with these obligations 
existing and new regulations may require paypal to revise further its compliance program  including the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions 
several countries in which paypal is regulated  including australia  luxembourg and singapore  have implemented new anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing laws and regulations  and paypal has had to make changes to its procedures in response 
in november  the australian anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing regulator austrac accepted an enforceable undertaking from paypal australia pursuant to which paypal australia agreed  among other things  to appoint an independent auditor to assess paypal australia s anti money laundering compliance policies and procedures and issue a report identifying any unremediated deficiencies accompanied by a plan by paypal to remedy any such deficiencies 
in the enforceable undertaking  austrac expressed concern that paypal australia did not have systems and controls in place to manage adequately its money laundering and terrorist financing risk 
in september  the independent auditor completed its review and issued its report  and paypal australia submitted a remediation plan 
paypal australia has invested in improvements to its anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing systems  policies and operations as part of its remediation plan 
in addition  paypal australia will be required to obtain additional information from customers  verify that information  and monitor its customers activities more closely 
as paypal continues to localize its services in additional jurisdictions  it could be required to meet standards similar to or more burdensome than those in australia 
these requirements could impose significant costs on paypal  cause delay to other planned product improvements  make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of its products 
although there have been no definitive interpretations to date  paypal has taken actions as though its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the us federal reserve board 
under such regulations  among other things  paypal is required to provide advance disclosure of changes to its service  to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer 
paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants  but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account 
additionally  even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to  for each non compliant transaction or up to  per violation in any class action  and we could also be liable for plaintiffs attorneys fees 
in the second quarter of  two putative class action lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v 
ebay inc and paypal  inc 
and moises zepeda v 
paypal  inc were filed in the us district court in the northern district of california 
these lawsuits contain allegations related to violations of aspects of the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e and violations of a previous settlement agreement related to regulation e  and or allege that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited users accounts 
these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypal s practices among other remedies 
a determination that there have been violations of the electronic fund transfer act  regulation e or violations of other laws relating to paypal s practices could expose paypal to significant liability 
any changes to paypal s practices resulting from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend product resources  which could delay other planned product launches or improvements and further harm our business 
our bill me later service is similarly subject to a variety of laws and regulations 
although we do not originate loans under the bill me later service  we do purchase receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the bank which originates them 
one or more jurisdictions may conclude that the ebay company which purchases those receivables is a lender or money transmitter or loan broker  which could subject us to liability or regulation in such jurisdictions 
as described under the caption bill me later s operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above  a lawsuit was filed against bill me later in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging that in its relationship with the former issuer of the bill me later credit products  bill me later was acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various california laws  including the state s usury law 
additionally  federal regulators could mandate changes to the relationship between us and the issuing bank of the bill me later credit products 
any termination or interruption of the issuing bank s lending services to consumers could result in an interruption of bill me later services  as described under the caption bill me later s operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above 
given that our payments business is subject to regulations in the manner described above  any determination that we have not properly complied with laws and regulations or any instances in which we are criminally indicted or found to have violated a criminal statute or regulation could adversely impact our regulatory status in one or more jurisdictions  which would harm our business 
the listing or sale by our users of pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business 
we have received in the past  and we anticipate receiving in the future  communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our service by our users infringe third party copyrights  trademarks and trade names  or other intellectual property rights 
see item legal proceedings below 
although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites  some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners have actively asserted their purported rights against online companies  including ebay 
allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threatened and actual litigation against us from time to time by rights owners  including litigation brought by luxury brand owners such as tiffany co 
in the us  rolex us and coty prestige lancaster group gmbh in germany  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france  and l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie and laboratoire garnier cie in several european countries 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek to hold ebay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on our sites by third parties  for tester and other consumer products labeled in a manner to prevent resale and for unboxed and other allegedly nonconforming products listed on our sites by third parties  for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in listings or otherwise on our sites and in connection with paid search advertisements  for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws or parallel import laws for listings of authentic items  and for alleged non compliance with consumer protection laws 
such plaintiffs seek  among other remedies  injunctive relief and damages 
in the aggregate  these suits could result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could  individually or in the aggregate  adversely affect our business 
there are approximately  rights owners in our verified rights owner vero program  and each rights owner has anywhere from one to several hundred brands 
statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to  per copyright violation and  per trademark violation in the us  and may be even higher in other jurisdictions 
these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs or make our websites less convenient to our customers  any of which could materially harm our business 
in addition  rights owners have aggressively sought to reduce the applicability of limitations to intellectual property rights such as copyright exhaustion and the first sales doctrine in cases such as vernor v 
autodesk inc ninth circuit court of appeals  wiley v 
kirtsaeng second circuit court of appeals and costco wholesale corp 
v 
omega sa sup 
sa to the extent such doctrines are limited  the supply of goods available for resale on our sites may be adversely affected 
in addition to litigation from rights owners  we may be subject to regulatory  civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided in the sale of counterfeit goods 
while we have had some early success in defending against such litigation  more recent cases have been based  at least in part  on different legal theories than those of earlier cases  and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation 
plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the digital millennium copyright act in the us or as a hosting provider in the european union under the electronic commerce directive because of the alleged active nature of our involvement with our sellers  and that whether or not such safe harbors are available  we should be found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed listings that are counterfeit or are authentic but allegedly violate trademark or copyright law or effectively suspended users who have created such listings 
while we do not believe the european court of justice decision in the l or al case see item legal proceedings below changes the standard for hosting immunity under the electronic commerce directive  rights owners in european jurisdictions have asserted that our degree of participation in the transaction should cause us to be unable to take advantage of the hosting immunity exception 
final resolution of this issue has been left to the national courts of countries in the european union 
we are continuously seeking to improve and modify our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items through ongoing business initiatives designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer satisfaction and by responding to new patterns we are seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our users 
notwithstanding these efforts  we believe that the legal climate  especially in europe  is becoming more adverse to our positions  which may require us to take actions which could lower our revenues  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers  any of which could materially harm our business 
in addition  a public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our sites  even if factually incorrect  would damage our reputation  lower the price our sellers receive for their items and damage our business 
content owners and other intellectual property rights owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items  such as payment companies 
to the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against paypal based upon the use of paypal s payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items  including on our websites  our business could be harmed 
several jurisdictions have adopted new laws in these areas  and others are considering imposing additional restrictions 
in addition  new laws have been proposed regulating internet companies with respect to intellectual property issues 
for example  sopa  which has been introduced in the us house of representatives  and pipa  which has been proposed in the us senate  would give rights owners and the government broad powers to bring lawsuits against websites accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement  and such lawsuits could result in  among other consequences  payment providers such as paypal being precluded from doing business with allegedly infringing sites  as well as search engines being precluded from linking to  and internet service providers being required to block access to  such sites 
in addition  the european commission has reopened the intellectual property enforcement directive  which could potentially increase our exposure to enforcement actions from rights owners 
implementation of these or similar laws could require us to change our business practices  increase our compliance costs and harm our business 
we are subject to patent litigation 
we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents 
we are a defendant in a number of patent suits and we have been notified of several other potential patent disputes 
we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and gsi segments as our services continue to expand in scope and complexity eg  our local  social  mobile and digital initiatives  as we expand into new businesses  including through acquisitions  and as the universe of patent owners who may claim that we  companies that we have acquired  or our customers infringe their patents and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners correspondingly increases 
such claims may be brought directly against our companies and or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or as a business matter 
we and other technology companies have seen more of these claims from an increasing number of third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims 
these claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to resolve  and could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements  or could require us to cease conducting certain operations 
use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business 
we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services  or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner  and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services 
we have been subject to several lawsuits based upon such allegations 
in december  an executive of baazee 
com  our indian subsidiary  was arrested in connection with a user s listing of a pornographic video clip on that website 
we continue to contest the charges related to this arrest 
similarly  one of our korean subsidiaries iac and one of its employees were found criminally liable for listings which occurred prior to our acquisition of iac on iac s website 
the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent prohibited dvds from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty 
in a number of circumstances  third parties  including government regulators and law enforcement officials  have alleged that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws  including antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets  laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items  the fencing of stolen goods  selective distribution channel laws  distance selling laws and the sale of items outside of the us that are regulated by us export controls 
as we seek to reduce bad buying experiences and improve the customer experience on our sites  our level of interaction with buyers and sellers may increase over time  which could in turn increase our potential exposure to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services 
although we have prohibited the listing of illegal and stolen goods and certain high risk items and implemented other protective measures  we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings  any of which could harm our business 
any costs incurred as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods could harm our business 
certain manufacturers and large retailers have sought new us federal and state legislation regarding stolen goods that could limit our ability to allow sellers to use our sites without confirming the source of  and their legal rights to sell  the underlying goods 
in addition  from time to time we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal goods and stolen goods using our services 
this negative publicity could damage our reputation  diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our services 
paypal s payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses  including illegal online gambling  fraudulent sales of goods or services  illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances  piracy of software  movies  music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods  money laundering  terrorist financing  bank fraud  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products  online securities fraud and encouraging  promoting  facilitating or instructing others to engage in illegal activities 
there has been an increased focus by rights owners and us government officials on the role that payments systems play in the sale of  and payment for  pirated digital goods on the internet 
recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional payments related proposals are under active consideration by government policymakers 
despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct  illegal activities could still be funded using paypal 
any resulting claims  liabilities or loss of transaction volume could harm our business 
if our gsi business is unable to enhance its platform and migrate clients to its new platform in a timely and cost effective manner  it would be substantially harmed 
our gsi business is in the process of enhancing and unbundling the components of its ecommerce and payments platform and migrating its existing customers to its new platform 
this project is very expensive and time consuming and involves significant technical risk 
previously planned migrations of certain clients to the new platform have been delayed into and beyond 
if client migrations to the new platform continue to be delayed  the functionality of the new platform is not accepted by gsi s existing clients or prospective clients targeted by gsi  the new platform contains an unacceptable amount of design flaws or does not perform or operate as expected  or gsi fails to meet client commitments and services level agreements  gsi could be subject to substantial penalties under its agreements with its clients including significant financial penalties and termination rights for its affected clients  our relationships with its clients and their respective businesses could be substantially harmed  and gsi clients may seek to terminate their contracts with gsi early based on actual or proposed breach 
any of these events or circumstances could materially and adversely affect our gsi business 
even if accomplished successfully  this development and migration project may cost more than expected or take longer than currently planned  which could harm our gsi business 
we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services remains unsettled in many jurisdictions 
claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation  libel  invasion of privacy  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories have been brought against us  as well as other online service companies 
in addition  domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information 
our marketplaces service features a feedback forum  which includes information from users regarding other users 
although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us  claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for not removing content posted in the feedback forum 
furthermore  several court decisions arguably have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to internet service providers like us in the us under the communications decency act 
for example  the ninth circuit has held that certain immunity provisions under the communications decency act might not apply to the extent that a website owner materially contributes to the development of unlawful content on its website 
as our websites evolve  challenges to the applicability of these immunities can be expected to continue 
in addition  the paris court of appeal has ruled in the louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture cases that applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts from liability are inapplicable to ebay given that ebay actively promotes bidding on its sellers listings and receives a commission on successful transactions  and is therefore a broker 
the ecj decision in the l oreal case see item legal proceedings below gave broad discretion to national courts in europe to determine if internet hosting immunity applies to ebay 
accordingly  our potential liability to third parties for the user provided content on our sites  particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled  may increase 
if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate  we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings  which would negatively affect our financial results 
in addition  the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business 
government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties 
a large number of transactions occur on our websites on a daily basis 
government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about ebay  paypal and gsi  which  while small as a percentage of our total transactions  are large in aggregate numbers 
as a result  from time to time we have been contacted by various us and foreign governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud 
paypal has received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states 
in september  paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay million to the attorneys general  shorten and streamline its user agreement  increase educational messaging to users about funding choices and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users 
from time to time  we face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken that are designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites and we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future 
for example  in  the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods 
other regulators have requested information concerning paypal s limitations of customer accounts 
similarly  bill me later has from time to time received customer complaints that could result in investigations into bill me later s business practices by state or federal regulators 
as a result of the recent credit crisis  new laws have been  and additional new laws and regulations are expected to be  adopted that impose additional obligations and restrictions on the provision of credit  among other requirements 
we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future  including under existing or new credit laws or regulations  which may lead to action against us 
we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts  customer support procedures  operating procedures and disclosures of the relevant business 
if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries  we could be subject to enforcement actions  fines or other penalties  or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business 
we are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger and the scope and complexity of our businesses has expanded eg  our local  social  mobile and digital initiatives 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts as our services to users continues to expand and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
we are also subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws of general applicability  including laws regulating working conditions 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  damage awards including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions  injunctive relief  or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources  or otherwise harm our business 
changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate 
beginning in  we have transitioned buyers in the us  us and germany to a dispute resolution resolutions process provided by ebay customer support  which now serves as the primary entry point for buyers in these countries if they are unable to resolve their disputes with ebay sellers 
among other things  the resolutions process provides that ebay will generally reimburse the buyer for the full amount of an item s purchase price including original shipping costs  in cases where the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing  and the seller does not provide adequate resolution to the buyer 
ebay then attempts to recoup amounts paid to the buyer from the seller s paypal accounts or through other collection methods 
our costs associated with resolutions have increased as a result of these changes to our resolutions policies and process  in part because ebay may not have the same level of rights of recoupment against sellers as paypal  resulting in higher costs to operate the program 
these changes  together with any further changes that we may make to our resolutions process in the future  may be negatively received by  and lead to dissatisfaction on the part of  some of our sellers  and may also result in an increase in buyer fraud and associated transaction losses 
in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg  airline  cruise or concert tickets  custom made goods  or subscriptions  ebay and or paypal could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services  either through its buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment through paypal 
while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities  these reserves may be insufficient and our operating results could be adversely affected 
failure to deal effectively with bad transactions and customer disputes would increase our loss rate and harm our business 
over the last several years  we have enhanced the buyer and seller protections offered by paypal in certain ebay marketplaces  and in certain countries for transactions outside of ebay marketplaces 
these changes to paypal s buyer and seller protection program could result in future changes and fluctuations in our payments transaction loss rate 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  our payments transaction losses including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled million and million  representing and of our net total payment volume  respectively 
beginning in  we have also changed the dispute resolution process for transactions on ebay 
com  ebay 
co 
uk and ebay 
de  as described in greater detail above under the caption changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate  which could result in an increase in our combined ebay and paypal transaction losses 
paypal s highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud 
in configuring its service  paypal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers 
identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen credit card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal 
we believe that several of paypal s current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud 
while paypal uses advanced anti fraud technologies  we expect that technically knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypal s anti fraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods 
from time to time  such fraudsters may discover and exploit vulnerabilities that may not immediately be identified and remediated  which in turn may result in one time increases in fraud and associated transaction losses 
in addition  because users frequently use the same passwords for different sites  a data breach of a third party site can result in a spike in transaction losses 
finally  paypal s service could be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches  and paypal may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches 
merchants could also request reimbursement  or stop using paypal  if they are affected by buyer fraud or other types of fraud 
paypal incurs substantial losses due to claims from buyers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant s description  whether those claims arise from merchant fraud or from an unintentional failure to perform by the merchant 
paypal seeks to recover such losses from the merchant  but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay 
paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase  from buyer fraud  from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments 
in addition  if losses incurred by paypal related to payment card transactions become excessive  they could potentially result in paypal losing the right to accept payment cards for payment  which would materially and adversely affect paypal s business both on and off ebay 
in the event that paypal was unable to accept payment cards  the velocity of trade on ebay and websites operated by gsi s clients that accept paypal as a form of payment could also decrease  in which case our business would further suffer 
the bill me later service is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants  users of the bill me later service and third parties handling its user information 
our payments business has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud  but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings 
if these measures do not succeed  our business will suffer 
ebay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites 
ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased 
in some cases  individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites 
ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase 
non payment may occur because of miscommunication  because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item  or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously in order to harm either the seller or ebay 
in some european and asian jurisdictions  buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period 
while ebay can  in some cases  suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users  ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods  or otherwise make users whole other than through our buyer protection programs 
the impact of changes to our dispute resolutions program implemented beginning in is discussed in more detail above under the caption changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate 
our limited ebay and paypal buyer protection programs represent the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded  have not received the item that they purchased  or have received an item different than what was described 
however  users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their credit card company or bank  which in turn will seek recovery from paypal 
ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased 
we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made 
our liability for these sort of claims is only beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some non us jurisdictions than it is in the non us litigation involving liability for third party actions could be costly and time consuming for us  divert management attention  result in increased costs of doing business  lead to adverse judgments  or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us  including imposing fines or seeking injunctions 
negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our marketplaces  payments and gsi services could damage our reputation  reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users and diminish the value of our brand names 
we believe that negative user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our services 
from time to time  we have considered more active mechanisms designed to combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction  including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity as a result 
for example  in the us and the us  we may request that paypal hold seller funds in certain instances eg  for sellers with a limited selling history or below standard performance ratings  which is intended to help improve seller performance and increase buyer satisfaction 
we may expand the scope of such programs in the future and introduce other programs with similar aims in these and other countries 
our increased usage of these or other mechanisms to attempt to improve buyer satisfaction could result in dissatisfaction on the part of sellers  loss of share to competing marketplaces  reduced selection of inventory on our sites and other adverse effects 
governmental regulators worldwide are also evaluating approaches intended to reduce online fraud 
some of the current proposals eg  two factor authentication in france to verify a user s identity could increase our costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business 
any factors that reduce cross border trade could harm our business 
cross border trade has become an increasingly important source of both revenue and profits for us 
cross border transactions using our websites generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market 
we generally earn higher transaction fees for cross border transactions involving paypal  and our marketplaces business continues to represent a relatively straightforward way for buyers and sellers to engage in cross border trade compared with other alternatives 
cross border trade also represents our primary or in some cases  only presence in certain markets in which internet use is accelerating and we have a limited or no domestic marketplaces business eg  brazil latin america  china  russia and various developing countries 
the interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws  such as selective distribution channel laws and parallel import laws  to users in other countries eg  the interpretation and application of such laws to the sale of gray market goods and the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg  the jurisdiction of the buyer  the seller  and or the location of the item being sold are extremely complicated in the context of cross border trade  and to the extent any interpretation or application of such laws imposes restrictions on  or increases the costs of  purchasing  selling or shipping goods across national borders  our business would be harmed 
any additional factors that increase the costs of purchasing  selling or shipping goods across national borders make it more difficult to do so in practice  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  delivery service rates  currency restrictions  export control laws  customs enforcement  court rulings and tariffs  or that otherwise would result in a net reduction in cross border trade on our sites  would adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to online security risks  including security breaches 
our businesses involve the storage and transmission of users proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  litigation and potential liability 
an increasing number of websites  including several other large internet companies  have recently disclosed breaches of their security  some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their sites 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems  change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users 
a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users proprietary information  cause interruption in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws  significant legal and financial exposure  damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures  which could harm our business 
data security breaches may also result from non technical means  for example  actions by a suborned employee 
gsi s clients also face similar risks of security breaches  and to the extent that such clients are harmed as a result of a security breach  gsi s business would also be adversely affected 
a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us 
for example  paypal s users routinely provide credit card and other financial information  and gsi customers routinely provide credit card information and other personally identifiable information which we maintain to facilitate the ease of future transactions 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information  including customer payment card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised 
under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors  if there is a breach of payment card information that we store  or that is stored by paypal s direct payment card processing customers  we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses 
in addition  if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards  even if customer information has not been compromised  we could incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or pay their fees 
if we were unable to accept payment cards  our businesses would be seriously damaged 
our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  and we have experienced denial of service type attacks on our system that have  in certain instances  made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time 
for example  in december  paypal was subject to a series of distributed denial of service attacks following paypal s decision to permanently restrict the account used by wikileaks due to an alleged violation of paypal s acceptable use policy 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches 
these issues are likely to become more difficult as we expand the number of places where we operate 
security breaches  including any breaches of our security measures or those of parties with which we have commercial relationships eg  our clients and third party service providers that result in the unauthorized release of users personal information  could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies carry low coverage limits  which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
our users  as well as those of other prominent internet companies  have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate passwords  credit card numbers  or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our users computers 
these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay  paypal  a gsi client  or one of our other businesses eg  stubhub  or by a user of one of our businesses  but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program 
despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through product improvements and user education  spoof and phishing activities remain a serious problem that may damage our brands  discourage use of our websites and increase our costs 
changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to laws relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users  especially for financial information and for users located outside of the us as an entity licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg  paypal europe sarl et cie  sca is subject to banking secrecy laws 
in many cases  these laws apply not only to third party transactions  but also to transfers of information between ourselves and our subsidiaries  and between ourselves  our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations 
the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux  and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country 
the european union recently proposed new data laws that give customers additional rights and provide additional restrictions on data use by companies and harsher penalties if data is misused 
our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with new laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and applications 
complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
in addition  we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal  state or international privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations or  in the case of our gsi businesses  any such failure or perceived failure on the part of gsi or gsi s clients could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others eg  class action privacy litigation  subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity  require us to change our business practices  increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
for example  the federal trade commission  or ftc  has recently entered into an a number of consent decrees with major online companies  including facebook and google  to settle allegations of unfair or deceptive privacy practices 
the ftc s consent decrees with facebook and google require those companies to implement a comprehensive privacy program and undergo regular  independent privacy audits for the next years  among other requirements 
certain of our businesses  including gsi s interactive marketing services business  utilize behavioral marketing generally  the tracking of a user s online activities to deliver relevant content to internet users 
the ftc has released a staff report with principles to address consumer privacy issues that may arise from behavioral marketing and to encourage industry self regulation 
the ftc also has issued a staff report in december on consumer privacy policy  proposing a set of self regulatory best practices and several policy recommendations for consideration by congress  including institution of do not track mechanisms 
any such regulations or legislation could  if enacted  prohibit the use of certain technologies  including those that track individuals activities on the internet or geolocation via mobile devices 
such laws and regulations could restrict our ability to collect and use page viewing data and personal information  which may reduce demand for our services or require changes to our current business models  which could harm our business 
data collection  privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern 
if internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites and services as a result  our business could be harmed 
as noted above  we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches  which themselves may result in a violation of these laws 
our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control 
we derive significant revenue from advertising on our websites 
revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures  such as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer spending  the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative to other websites 
the economic downturn adversely impacted our advertising revenue 
in addition  major search engine operators have the ability to change from time to time  at their sole discretion  the rules and search algorithms governing the pricing  availability and placement of online advertising 
any changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our websites  either directly or indirectly 
for example  retailers pay a fee to shopping 
com for online shoppers directed to their websites by our shopping 
com website 
rule changes made by search engines beginning in disrupted traffic to our shopping 
com website  which in turn adversely affected click through traffic to retailers from our shopping 
com website and associated fee revenue 
finally  legislators and regulators in various jurisdictions  including the us and the european union  are reviewing internet advertising models and the use of user related data and considering proposals that could restrict or otherwise impact this business model 
if we experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to economic  competitive  regulatory  technological or other factors  or the renegotiation of the terms of our contracts with major advertising companies  or a reduction in our ability to effectively place advertisements on our sites  or are otherwise unable to provide value to our advertisers  our business and financial results would suffer 
our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands  and these efforts may be costly 
we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services  and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts across all of our brands 
we will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on  and devote substantial resources to  advertising  marketing  and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users 
since  we have significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting  adding shopping 
com  our classified websites including den bl avis  bilbasen  ebay classifieds including ebay anuncios  ebay kleinanzeigen and ebay annunci  gumtree  kijiji  loquo  marktplaats 
nl  mobile 
de  alamaula and rent 
com  stubhub  bill me later  gmarket  milo  where  red laser  zong and gsi  among others 
each of these brands requires its own resources  increasing the costs of our branding efforts 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues  and even if they do  any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands 
also  major search engine operators that we use to advertise our brands have frequently changing rules that govern the pricing  availability and placement of online advertisements eg  paid search  keywords  and changes to these rules could negatively affect our ability to use online advertising to promote our brands in a cost effective manner 
if we fail to promote and maintain our brands  or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands  our business would be harmed 
new and existing regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet 
it is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property issues  parallel imports and distribution controls  taxation  libel and defamation  obscenity and personal privacy apply to online businesses such as ours 
the majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
those laws that do reference the internet  such as the us digital millennium copyright act  the us can spam act and the european union s directives on distance selling and electronic commerce  are being interpreted by the courts  but their applicability and scope remain uncertain 
as our activities and the types of goods and services listed on our websites expand  including through acquisitions such as bill me later and stubhub  regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction  either generally or with respect to certain actions eg  the sale of real estate  event tickets  cultural goods  boats and automobiles 
recent financial and political events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies in general  and financial services companies in particular  and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our businesses 
our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business model to be a threat to their business to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators 
these established businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations 
they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services 
in particular  these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing  parallel imports  professional seller obligations  selective distribution networks  stolen goods  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues 
changing the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for third party listings could negatively impact our business 
over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in a number of states and the us congress that would make ebay liable for the sale of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform  including gift cards and health and beauty products 
while no such legislation has passed to date  the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation  and if any of these laws are adopted they could harm our business 
numerous states and foreign jurisdictions  including the state of california  where our headquarters are located  have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers 
several states and some foreign jurisdictions  including france  have attempted  and may attempt in the future  to impose such regulations upon us or our users 
attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing 
in france  we have been sued by conseil des ventes  the french auction regulatory authority  which has alleged that sales on our french website constitute illegal auctions that cannot be performed without its consent 
although we have won this lawsuit in the lower court  this decision is being appealed 
a lawsuit alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two associations of french antique dealers  and is now pending on appeal after we won this lawsuit in the first instance 
we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits 
however  these and other regulatory and licensure claims and enforcement actions could result in costly litigation and  if unsuccessful  we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues for example  by forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations 
we could also be subject to fines or other penalties  and any of these outcomes could harm our business 
a number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws 
for example  trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holder s consent 
the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet  and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations  our business could be harmed 
as we expand and localize our international activities  we become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate 
in addition  because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide  one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users  or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction 
for example  in the louis vuitton malletier litigation  we were found liable in france  under french law  for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers or sellers see item legal proceedings below 
laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the us may be less favorable than those in the us  giving greater rights to consumers  content owners  competitors  users and other third parties 
compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings  and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business 
in addition  we may be subject to overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us eg  in cross border trade 
our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services  in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions 
following the global financial crisis  us federal lawmakers enacted legislation in overhauling the federal government s oversight of consumer financial products and systemic risk in the us financial system 
although the full effect of the new legislation will be dependent on regulations to be adopted by a number of different agencies including the recently created consumer financial protection bureau  we expect the general effect of the financial reform law will be to require paypal and bill me later to make additional disclosures to their users and to impose new restrictions on certain of their activities 
these new obligations will impose new compliance requirements and obligations on us  increase our costs and may result in increased litigation  the need to make expensive product changes and other adverse impacts on our business 
in addition  we also expect that the continued implementation of the financial reform law enacted in will adversely impact some significant traditional revenue streams for banks 
for example  in june  the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees 
as a result of this and other regulations implementing the financial reform law  banks may need to revise their business models to remain profitable  which may lead them to charge more for services which were previously provided for free or at lower cost 
any resulting increases in service fees required for paypal to process transactions eg  service fees for automated clearing house transactions would increase our costs and could adversely affect our business 
in addition  in january  the consumer financial protection bureau finalized new regulations  required by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which will require paypal  starting in  to provide additional disclosures  error resolution rights and cancellation rights to us consumers who make international payments 
these new requirements could increase our costs of processing international payments and could adversely affect our business 
changes to payment card networks or bank fees  rules  or practices could harm paypal s business 
paypal does not directly access payment card networks  such as visa and mastercard  which enable paypal s acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards 
as a result  paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions  and must pay fees for this service 
from time to time  payment card networks have increased  and may increase in the future  the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards 
paypal s payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing 
changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase paypal s operating costs and reduce its profit margins 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees  or have opened investigations as to whether visa or mastercard s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law 
in the united states  the financial reform law enacted in authorizes the federal reserve board to regulate debit card interchange rates and debit card network exclusivity provisions  and in june  the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard previously charged 
any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets could jeopardize paypal s competitive position against traditional credit and debit card processors 
while the regulations adopted by the federal reserve board in june do not treat paypal as a payment card network  future changes to those regulations or to paypal s business could potentially cause paypal to be treated as a payment card network  which could subject paypal to additional regulation and require paypal to change its business practices  which could reduce paypal s revenue and adversely affect paypal s business 
paypal is required by its processors to comply with payment card network operating rules  and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypal s customers 
the payment card networks set and interpret the card rules 
payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or re interpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow  or costly to implement 
as a result  paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments  or could lose its ability to give customers the choice of currency in which they would like their card to be charged  which would reduce paypal s revenues from cross border trade 
if paypal were unable to accept payment cards  its business would be seriously damaged 
in addition  the velocity of trade on ebay and websites operated by gsi s clients that accept paypal as a form of payment could decrease and our business would further suffer 
paypal is also required to comply with payment card networks special operating rules for internet payment services 
paypal and its payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these rules  but any failure to comply could result in fines  the amount of which would be within the payment card networks discretion 
paypal also could be subject to fines from payment card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk  primarily the sale of certain types of digital content 
for high risk merchants  paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants 
paypal has incurred fines from its payment card processors relating to paypal s failure to detect the use of its service by high risk merchants 
the amount of these fines has not been material  but did increase in compared to prior years 
any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts  could become material and could result in a termination of paypal s ability to accept payment cards or changes in paypal s process for registering new customers  which would seriously damage paypal s business 
similarly  consumers of the websites operated by gsi s clients typically pay for purchases by payment card or similar payment method 
accordingly  our gsi ecommerce services business faces risks similar to the risks described above for paypal 
bill me later s operations expose us to additional risks 
risks associated with our reliance on an unaffiliated lender in providing the bill me later service are discussed in detail under the caption bill me later s operations depend on lending services provided by an unaffiliated lender above 
the bill me later service relies on third party merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of all transaction volume by dollar amount through the bill me later service was settled through the facilities of a single vendor 
any disruption to these third party payment processing and gateway services would adversely affect the bill me later service 
the bill me later service is offered to a wide range of consumers  and the financial success of this business depends on the ability of the issuing bank of the bill me later credit products to manage credit risk related to those products 
the lender extends credit using bill me later s proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific customers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores 
based on these performance criteria  the lender may extend or increase lines of credit to consumers at the point of sale 
these algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment  among other factors 
the accuracy of the predictions and the ability of the lender and bill me later to manage credit risk related to the bill me later service may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes eg  bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations  competitors actions  changes in consumer behavior and other factors 
the lender may incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies  which may impact the financial performance of the bill me later service 
in addition  economic and financial conditions in the us may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit  including the credit extended by the lender to consumers who use the bill me later service  which could impair the growth and profitability of this business 
we anticipate that the volume of credit extended by webbank the financial institution issuing the bill me later credit products will increase as we continue to enable qualified buyers with a paypal account to use bill me later as a payment funding option for transactions on ebay 
com and on certain merchant websites that accept paypal 
we purchase the receivables relating to these consumer loans extended by the issuing bank  and therefore bear the risk of loss 
like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit  the bill me later service faces the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations  making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge offs 
the rate at which receivables were charged off as uncollectible  or the net charge off rate  was approximately and  respectively  for the fiscal years ended december  and december  the nonpayment rate among bill me later users may increase due to  among other things  worsening economic conditions  such as a recession in the us  and high unemployment rates 
consumers who miss payments on their obligations often fail to repay them  and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their credit 
we currently fund the purchase of receivables related to bill me later accounts through the sale of commercial paper  our cash balances and free cash flow generated from our portfolio of businesses 
effective september   we have funded the purchase of receivables generated through new bill me later accounts using funds from our international subsidiaries  and this funding is facilitated through our luxembourg based bank 
a downgrade in our credit ratings  particularly our short term credit ratings  would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue or  in certain circumstances  could prevent us from making commercial paper borrowings  increase our commercial paper borrowing costs  or both 
if we are unable to fund our purchase of receivables related to the bill me later business adequately or in a cost effective manner  the growth and profitability of this business would be significantly and adversely affected 
additionally  in providing the bill me later service  we face other risks similar to those faced by paypal described elsewhere in these risk factors  including under the captions government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties and if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfer  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
changes in paypal s funding mix could adversely affect paypal s results 
paypal pays significant transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using credit cards  lower fees when customers fund payments with debit cards  nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts  and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or through the bill me later service  or use buyer credit issued by ge money bank 
customers fund a significant portion of paypal s payment volume using credit and debit cards  and paypal s financial success will remain highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its senders fund payments using credit and debit cards 
customers may prefer funding payment transactions using credit cards or debit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons  including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with their payment card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described  the ability to earn frequent flier miles  cash rebates  or other incentives offered by payment card issuers  the ability to defer payment  or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal 
in addition  some of paypal s offerings  including the ability for buyers to make a limited number of payments without opening a paypal account  have a higher rate of payment card funding than paypal s basic product offering 
paypal s failure to manage customer funds properly could harm its business 
paypal s ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls 
in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers  paypal has a limited operating history and limited management experience in managing these internal controls 
as paypal s business continues to grow  it must continue to strengthen its internal controls accordingly 
paypal s success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds 
any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage customer funds accurately could severely diminish customer use of paypal s products 
systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites or services could harm our business 
we have experienced system failures from time to time  and any interruption in the availability of our websites will reduce our current revenues and profits  could harm our future revenues and profits and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
our ebay 
com website has been interrupted for periods of up to hours 
in november  technical systems issues resulted in ebay 
com users being unable to search for listed items for a period of several hours 
our paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days  including unavailability for approximately three hours affecting payments primarily on our ebay 
co 
uk site in may other of our websites eg  stubhub  milo and others  as well as websites of gsi clients and hosted services offered by gsi s interactive marketing services business  have experienced intermittent unavailability from time to time 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues  as well as potential service credits or other payments by gsi to its clients 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
reliability is particularly critical for paypal  especially as it seeks to expand its merchant services business and faces increased expectations on the part of users and merchants regarding the full time availability of paypal s services 
because paypal is a regulated financial institution  frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to fines  penalties  or mandatory and costly changes to paypal s business practices  and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim likely would be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  cyber attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  human error  hardware or software defects or malfunctions including defects or malfunctions of components of our systems that are supplied by third party service providers  and similar events or disruptions 
some of our systems  including our shopping 
com website and the systems related to the bill me later business  are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems are also subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays  and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
if we are unable to cost effectively upgrade and expand our websites and platforms  our business would suffer 
we must constantly add new hardware  update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our websites and platforms  and the new products and features we regularly introduce 
as our paypal business continues to grow  we are focused on updating our paypal platform to provide increased scale  improved performance and additional built in functionality addressing regulatory compliance matters eg  anti money laundering 
this upgrade process is expensive and time consuming  and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements 
failure to upgrade our technology  features  transaction processing systems  security infrastructure  or network infrastructure in a timely and cost effective manner to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume or changes to our site functionality could harm our business 
adverse consequences could include unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  degradation in levels of customer support  impaired quality of users experiences of our services  impaired quality of services for third party application developers using our externally accessible application programming interfaces and delays in reporting accurate financial information  and could result in customer dissatisfaction and the loss of existing users on our websites 
we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems  and any failure to do so could result in problems on our sites 
further  steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive  reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime 
risks associated with our ongoing efforts to enhance and unbundle the components of gsi s ecommerce and payments platform and to migrate gsi s existing customers to its new platform are discussed in detail under the caption if our gsi business is unable to enhance its platform and migrate clients to its new platform in a timely and cost effective manner  it would be substantially harmed above 
there are many risks associated with our international operations 
our international expansion has been rapid and our international business  especially in germany  korea and the uk  has also become critical to our revenues and profits 
net revenues outside the us accounted for approximately and of our net revenues in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
expansion into international markets  such as our entry into turkey in may upon the completion of our acquisition of additional shares in gittigidiyor and paypal s entry into emerging markets  requires management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local cultures  standards and policies 
the commercial  financial  internet  and transportation infrastructure in lesser developed countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our business models 
in many countries  we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do  and we may not benefit from first to market advantages 
we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations 
for example  in we withdrew our ebay marketplace offering from the japanese market  and in we contributed our business in china to a joint venture with a local chinese company 
even if we are successful in developing new markets  we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues from those sites for at least months in most countries 
as we continue to expand our businesses internationally  including through acquisitions  we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally  including the following strong local competitors  regulatory requirements  including regulation of internet and mobile services  auctioneering  professional selling  distance selling  privacy and data protection  banking and money transmitting  that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions  prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers  prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods  require product changes  require special licensure  subject us to various taxes  penalties or audits  or limit the transfer of information between us and our affiliates  greater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users  including uncertainty as a result of legal systems that are less developed with respect to the internet  unique local laws  conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or applicable law  cultural ambivalence towards  or non acceptance of  trading or payments over the internet or through mobile devices  laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses  difficulties in integrating with local payment providers  including banks  credit and debit card networks and electronic fund transfer systems  differing levels of retail distribution  shipping and internet and mobile infrastructures  different employee employer relationships and labor laws  and the existence of workers councils and labor unions  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  challenges associated with joint venture relationships and minority investments  including dependence on our joint venture partners  difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices and greater problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websites  higher internet service provider costs  different and more stringent user protection  data protection  privacy and other laws  seasonal reductions in business activity  expenses associated with localizing our products  including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  our ability to repatriate funds from abroad without adverse tax consequences  the possibility that foreign governments may impose currency controls or other restrictions on the repatriation of funds  volatility in a specific country s or region s political  economic or military conditions eg  in south korea relating to its disputes with north korea  challenges associated with maintaining relationships with local law enforcement and related agencies  potentially higher incidence of fraud and corruption and higher credit and transaction loss risks  and differing intellectual property laws 
some of these factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs 
as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and repatriating money without adverse tax consequences  as well as increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business is discussed in more detail under the caption we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates above 
in addition  we conduct certain functions  including product development  customer support and other operations  in regions outside the us  particularly in india and china 
we are subject to both us and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities  and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits associated with providing these functions outside of the us  including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements  could adversely affect our business 
we maintain a portion of shopping 
com s research and development facilities and personnel in israel  and have acquired other israeli companies 
political  economic and military conditions in israel affect those operations 
the future of peace efforts between israel and its neighboring countries remains uncertain 
increased hostilities or terrorism within israel or armed hostilities between israel and neighboring countries or other entities could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in israel  which could increase our costs 
in addition  many of our employees in israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances 
our israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military service  which could adversely affect our business 
acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties  dilution  and other harmful consequences 
we have acquired a significant number of businesses  technologies  services and products  including gsi commerce  inc which provides ecommerce and interactive marketing services  magento an open source ecommerce platform provider and zong which provides payments through mobile carrier billing 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy  including business combinations  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses  technologies  services  products and other assets  as well as strategic investments and joint ventures 
at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions 
any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
these transactions involve significant challenges and risks 
some of the areas where we may face difficulties include the need to integrate the operations  systems including accounting  management  information  human resource and other administrative systems  technologies  products and personnel of each acquired company  which is itself an inherently risky process  the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented  and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with integration  diversion of management time  as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration  particularly given the number  size and varying scope of our recent acquisitions  declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in  or acceleration of  compensation  or changes in management  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  the need to implement controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls  procedures and policies  risks associated with our expansion into new international markets and doing business internationally  including those described under the risk factor caption there are many risks associated with our international operations above  difficulties in entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions  in the case of foreign acquisitions  the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic  currency  political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries  the potential loss of key customers  vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of our acquisition plans  in some cases  the need to transition operations  users and customers onto our existing or new platforms  and liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition  including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes  violations of laws  rules and regulations  commercial disputes  tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities 
it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits  such as increased revenue and enhanced efficiencies  of any or all of our acquisitions  or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated  or may not be realized at all  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
future acquisitions may also require us to issue additional equity securities  spend our cash  or incur debt and increased interest expense  liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or write offs of goodwill  which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders 
in addition  we have made certain investments  including through joint ventures  in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control 
the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests  strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours  and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture 
our strategic investments may expose us to additional risks 
for example  gsi s minority interest in intershop communications ag is governed by german law  which could subject us to liability for certain disadvantages to intershop if we were deemed to be in control of intershop under german law 
we have also been sued by craigslist  which has alleged that we improperly misused confidential information from craigslist that we received as a minority investor 
our acquisition of gsi commerce  inc exposes us to additional risks 
our gsi business faces certain risks and challenges not shared by our other businesses  including those described under the risk factor captions if our gsi business is unable to enhance its platform and migrate clients to that new platform in a timely and cost effective manner  it would be substantially harmed and changes in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business 
competition for gsi s existing and potential clients is intense  and our gsi business may not be able to add new clients or keep existing clients on favorable terms  or at all 
for example  a change in the management of a gsi client could adversely affect our relationship with that client 
in addition  many of gsi s client contracts contain service level commitments 
if our gsi business is unable to meet these commitments  its relationships with its clients could be damaged  and client rights to terminate their contracts with gsi and or financial penalty provisions payable by gsi may be triggered 
if any existing gsi clients were to exit the business we provide services to  be acquired  declare bankruptcy  suffer other financial difficulties  fail to pay amounts owed to gsi and or terminate or modify their relationships with gsi in a manner unfavorable to us in particular with respect to the large merchants and brands that gsi serves  our gsi business could be adversely affected 
a portion of gsi s ecommerce services revenue is derived from the value of ecommerce transactions that flow through gsi s ecommerce services business 
accordingly  growth in gsi s ecommerce services revenue depends upon the continued growth of the online businesses of its clients 
gsi s ecommerce services business may be substantially impacted by any adverse conditions in the offline businesses of a gsi client that negatively impact that client s online businesses 
any impairment of the offline business of gsi clients  whether due to financial difficulties  impairment of client brands  reduction in marketing efforts  reduction in the number of client retail stores or otherwise  could negatively affect consumer traffic and sales through gsi s clients websites  which would result in lower revenues generated by our gsi business 
our gsi business also relies on its clients ability to accurately forecast product demand and select and buy the inventory for their corresponding online businesses 
under such arrangements  the client establishes product prices and pays gsi service fees based either on a fixed or variable percentage of revenues  or on the activity performed 
as a result  if gsi s clients fail to accurately forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory  the client s ecommerce business and  in turn  gsi s service fees could be adversely affected 
our gsi business holds inventory on behalf of its ecommerce services customers 
if gsi is unable to effectively manage and handle this inventory  this may result in unexpected costs that could adversely affect our gsi business 
any theft of such inventory  or damage or interruption to such inventory  including as a result of earthquakes  floods  fire  power loss  labor disputes  terrorist attacks and similar events and disruptions  could result in losses related to such inventory and disruptions to gsi s customers businesses  which could in turn adversely affect our gsi business 
gsi s interactive marketing services business relies on email marketing to drive consumer traffic to the websites operated by its clients 
email could become a less effective means of communicating with and marketing to consumers for a variety of reasons  including the following problems with technology that make gsi s email communications more difficult to deliver and for consumers to read eg  the inability of smart phones or similar communication devices to adequately display email  consumers may disregard marketing emails due to the large volume of such emails they receive  the inability of filters to effectively screen for unwanted emails  resulting in increased levels of junk mail  or spam  which may overwhelm consumer s email accounts  increased use of social networking sites  which may result in decreased use of email as a primary means of communication  continued security concerns regarding internet usage in general from viruses  worms or similar problems  and increased governmental regulation or restrictive policies adopted by internet service providers that make it more difficult or costly to utilize email for marketing communications 
if any of our gsi entities were to end up on spam lists or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted  unsolicited emails  their ability to contact customers through email could be significantly restricted 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  the demand for gsi s email marketing solutions could decrease and our gsi business could be harmed 
gsi s interactive marketing services business also utilizes mobile messaging as a means of communicating with consumers  which carries risks similar to the risks described above for email marketing 
our gsi business has relationships with search engines  comparison shopping sites  affiliate marketers  online advertising networks and other websites to provide content  advertising banners and other links to its clients ecommerce businesses 
our gsi business relies on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to clients ecommerce businesses 
if we are unable to maintain these relationships or enter into new relationships on acceptable terms  our ability to attract new customers could be harmed 
immediately following our acquisition of gsi  ebay sold of gsi s sports merchandise business and of its ruelala and shoprunner businesses which we refer to collectively as the divested entities  to kynetic llc  which we refer to as kynetic 
kynetic is primarily owned by gsi s former chairman  president and chief executive officer  mr 
michael rubin 
each of the divested entities was a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of gsi commerce 
in connection with and as a result of the divestiture to kynetic  our gsi business maintains certain commercial and financial relationships with the divested entities which expose it to certain risks of the businesses of kynetic and the divested entities 
as part of the kynetic divestiture  we loaned kynetic and the divested entities million  which is secured by certain assets of the divested entities 
kynetic and the divested entities ability to repay this obligation is dependent on the financial performance of kynetic and the divested entities 
if kynetic is unable to repay this obligation  our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
finally  our gsi business is also party to certain acquisition agreements relating to entities purchased by gsi prior to our acquisition  and which relate to businesses owned by the divested entities 
kynetic has agreed to indemnify gsi for certain liabilities incurred by gsi under these acquisition agreements 
if such liabilities were realized and kynetic was not able or willing to meet its indemnification obligations  gsi would be liable for them and its business could be harmed 
our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxes 
the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax  value added tax vat  goods and services tax  business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ebay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue 
many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce 
in many cases  it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or ecommerce 
in addition  some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of ecommerce 
for example  the state of new york has passed legislation that requires any out of state seller of tangible personal property to collect and remit new york use tax if the seller engages affiliates above certain financial thresholds in new york to perform certain business promotion activities 
several ecommerce companies are challenging this new law 
in june  california enacted legislation abx that requires certain out of state retailers to collect and remit california use tax on taxable sales to california purchasers when the retailer has a relationship with a person in california that refers customers to the retailer 
in september  the california governor signed into law ab  which supersedes abx and delays the implementation of such collection and remittance requirements until september or january depending on whether or not the us congress enacts legislation in this area 
the new california law is similar to the law passed in new york  but provides exclusions for certain forms of internet marketing and is limited to retailers who exceed prescribed sales volume thresholds 
however  if our sellers who are not already required to collect california sales or use tax believe that their use of our websites requires them to collect california use tax  they may elect to limit their use of our websites rather than collect the tax  which would harm our business 
north carolina  rhode island  illinois  arkansas and south dakota have also enacted similar laws related to affiliates  and a number of other states appear to be considering similar legislation 
the adoption of such legislation by states where ebay has significant operations that perform certain business promotion activities could result in a use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers 
this collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection  remittance and audit requirements would make selling on our websites less attractive for small business retailers  and would harm our business 
the state of colorado has enacted legislation that takes a different approach by imposing a set of use tax notice and reporting requirements but not the actual tax collection responsibility on certain retailers with no physical presence in colorado 
the law is designed to aid colorado in collecting use tax from colorado residents who purchase taxable items from out of state retailers 
the regulation promulgated by the colorado department of revenue excludes from these reporting obligations businesses that sell  or less into the state in a calendar year  thus limiting the impact on our sellers 
the law has been challenged in federal court by a number of out of state retailers and a federal district court has issued an injunction blocking enforcement of the regulations pending a resolution of the case 
oklahoma has enacted a similar law 
while the recent laws in new york  north carolina  rhode island  illinois  arkansas  south dakota  oklahoma and colorado do not specifically apply to our business  the proliferation of such state legislation  to expand sales and use tax collection on internet sales  could adversely affect some of our sellers and indirectly harm our business 
in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing  multi year effort by us state  and local governments to require collection and remittance of remote sales tax by out of state sellers s 
and hr  hr senate and hr house versions of the main street fairness act  have been introduced in the th congress 
these measures would allow states that meet certain simplification and other standards to require out of state sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by in state residents 
sellers meeting an as yet undefined small seller exception would be excluded from the requirements of the act 
other legislation introduced in the us congress  including hr and s 
 would grant states the authority to require out of state retailers to collect and remit sales taxes without requiring the state to join the streamlined sales tax project 
the adoption of remote sales tax collection legislation that lacks a robust small business exemption would result in the imposition of sales taxes and additional costs associated with complex sales tax collection  remittance and audit compliance requirements on our sellers 
this would make selling on our websites less attractive for small retailers  and would harm our business 
from time to time  some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes 
in may  the city of chicago notified both ebay and stubhub that they are liable for a city amusement tax on tickets to events in chicago  irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller  and filed suit to enforce collection of taxes it claims are due 
in march  the court ruled that stubhub is not required to collect and remit the city amusement tax 
the city of chicago requested reconsideration of this ruling and stubhub sought clarification of the ruling relative to the remaining counts as well 
in august  the court entered a final order dismissing the case against stubhub 
in december  the court also dismissed the case against ebay 
the city of chicago appealed both matters to the seventh circuit court of appeals 
the seventh circuit has issued an opinion in the stubhub matter rejecting the federal arguments advanced by stubhub and certifying the state law arguments to the illinois state supreme court 
in october  the illinois supreme court ruled that state municipalities may not require electronic intermediaries such as stubhub to collect and remit amusement taxes on resold tickets 
the city of chicago has requested a rehearing before the illinois supreme court and the court has not yet ruled on that request 
the application of similar existing or future laws could adversely affect our business 
several proposals have been made at the us state and local level that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet 
these proposals  if adopted  could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands  and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities 
the us federal government s moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been extended through november this moratorium does not prohibit federal  state  or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium and or one of its extensions 
similar issues exist outside of the us  where the application of vat or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers such as ebay is uncertain and evolving 
while we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due  certain of our subsidiaries have  from time to time  received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees 
should such taxes become applicable  our business could be harmed 
we collect and remit indirect taxes in certain jurisdictions 
however  tax authorities may raise questions about our obligation to collect and remit such taxes  as well as the proper calculation of such taxes 
for example  a korean tax authority is currently asserting that certain coupons and incentives available on our sites should not be deducted when computing taxes on our fees 
should any new taxes become applicable to our fees or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient  our business could be harmed 
we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services 
one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection  reporting or record keeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce 
such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been discussed in the us congress  several states and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if an ebay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates 
in july  the housing and economic recovery act of hr was signed into law 
this law contains provisions that require companies that provide payments over electronic means to users to report to the internal revenue service irs information on payments received by certain customers 
the legislation  effective for payments received after december   requires paypal and other electronic payments providers  as well as potentially stubhub and similar companies  to report to the irs on customers subject to us income tax who receive more than  in payments and more than payments in a year  to request tax id numbers from us taxpayers and track payments by tax id number  and to withhold a proportion of payments and forward such withholding to the irs if customers who receive more than payments do not provide correct and complete information 
we have had to modify our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations 
the irs regulations may also require us to collect a certification of non us taxpayer status from international merchants 
these requirements may decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
any failure by us to meet these new requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business 
one or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction  regardless of where the respective users are located 
imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business 
foreign authorities may also require ebay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers  including tax requirements 
in addition  we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites  and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data 
the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers  especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce  and any use of those records to investigate  collect taxes from  or prosecute sellers  could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business 
we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate 
in most cases  we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries 
however  because of our unique business model  the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain 
a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our business 
we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebay s obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations 
passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or tax related reporting requirements could harm our users and our business 
there have been  and will continue to be  substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which ebay conducts or will conduct business 
our tickets business is subject to regulatory  competitive  and other risks that could harm this business 
our tickets business  which includes our stubhub business  is subject to numerous risks 
many jurisdictions have laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets 
some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all  or highly regulate the resale of tickets  and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions may be adopted that could limit or inhibit our ability to operate  or our users ability to continue to use  our tickets business 
for example  the unauthorized resale of football soccer tickets is illegal in the uk  where we recently launched our stubhub site 
regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions 
in october  two plaintiffs filed a purported class action lawsuit in north carolina superior court alleging that stubhub sold and facilitated and participated in the sale of concert tickets to plaintiffs with the knowledge that the tickets were resold in violation of north carolina s maximum ticket resale price law which has been subsequently amended 
in february  the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment  concluding that immunity under the communications decency act did not apply 
the trial court further held that stubhub violated the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices statute as it pertains to the two named plaintiffs  and certified its decision for immediate appeal to the north carolina court of appeals 
stubhub has appealed this decision 
some event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our sites 
suits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past  and may in the future  be filed against stubhub and ebay by venue owners  competitors  ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers 
such litigation could result in damage awards  could require us to change our business practices in ways that may be harmful to our business  or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business 
our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries 
the economic downturn resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our sites and negatively impacted revenue and profits 
in addition  a work stoppage  strike or lockout by a professional sports league for example  the recently ended national basketball association lockout that results in the cancellation of all or a portion of the games in a league s season would harm our tickets business 
in addition  a portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on stubhub is held by stubhub in digital form 
systems failures  security breaches  theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such tickets inventory could materially harm our tickets business 
our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources  including ticketing service companies such as live nation entertainment formerly ticketmaster  aeg  comcast spectacor and tickets 
com  event organizers such as professional sports teams and leagues  ticket brokers and other online and offline ticket resellers  such as ticketsnow which is owned by live nation entertainment and razorgator 
in addition  some ticketing service companies and event organizers have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designed to restrict or prohibit the transferability of such event tickets 
ticketing service companies have also begun to use market based pricing strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices than they historically have for premium tickets 
besides charging higher prices  these ticketing service companies have also imposed additional restrictions on transferability for these types of tickets  such as requiring customers to pick up these tickets at will call with the purchasing credit card 
to the extent that event tickets issued in this manner cannot be resold on our websites  or to the extent that we are otherwise unable to compete with these competitors  our tickets business would be harmed 
pursuant to commercial arrangements  stubhub provides certain of its partners with integrated resale transactions  which consumers may prefer due to  among other factors  almost instant delivery and lower fraud concerns 
these integrations are largely deal dependent  and these arrangements may not be renewed on favorable terms  or at all 
we depend on key personnel 
our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel and our ability to retain and motivate them 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any key person life insurance policies  and some members of our senior management team have fully vested the vast majority of their in the money equity incentives 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we are currently seeking to fill the position of president  paypal on our senior management team  as well as other key management positions at paypal 
our businesses all depend on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer support personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we may be unable to successfully attract  integrate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment 
fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees whose stock option strike prices are substantially above current market prices 
similarly  decreases in the number of unvested in the money stock options held by existing employees  whether because our stock price has declined  options have vested  or because the size of follow on option grants has declined  may make it more difficult to retain and motivate employees 
problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business 
a number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us 
such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings  merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software  storefronts that help our users list items  caching services that make our sites load faster and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform  among others 
in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success  while in other cases we have none 
paypal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the payment card and bank clearing networks 
similarly  bill me later relies on an unaffiliated lender in providing the bill me later service and also relies heavily on third parties to operate its services  including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions 
financial or regulatory issues  labor issues eg  strikes or work stoppages or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our websites or make completing transactions or payments on our websites more difficult  thereby harming our business 
in addition  price increases by  or service terminations  disruptions or interruptions at  companies that provide services to our users and clients such as postal and delivery services could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions or for us to timely fulfill and ship products sold on the websites operated by gsi s clients  thereby harming our business 
the us postal service has announced that it is considering closing thousands of local post offices and ending saturday mail delivery 
while we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance our shipping experience  these closures could require certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient  which could in turn decrease the velocity of trade on our site  thereby harming our business 
in addition  any security breach at a company providing services to our users could also adversely affect our customers and harm our business 
in addition  we have outsourced certain functions to third party providers  including customer support and product development functions  which are critical to our operations 
if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily  our operations could be disrupted  which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business  reputation and operating results 
although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with  or if necessary replace  third parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
if any third parties were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms  including as a result of bankruptcy due to poor economic conditions  we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms  or at all 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or anti fraud measures could diminish use of our services 
customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services 
measures that we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our sites by making our sites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users 
these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes 
effective customer support requires significant personnel expense  and if not managed properly  this expense could significantly impact our profitability 
failure to manage or train our own or outsourced customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively 
negative publicity about  or negative experiences with  customer support for any of our businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brands individually or as a whole 
because paypal is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment  paypal must provide both telephone and email customer support and resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames 
as part of paypal s program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering  paypal may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customer s account activity are identified by paypal s risk models as suspicious 
paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions  and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging  among other things  failure to resolve account restrictions promptly 
in the second quarter of  two putative class action lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v 
ebay inc and paypal  inc  and moises zepeda v 
paypal  inc were filed in the us district court in the northern district of california 
these lawsuits contain allegations that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited user s accounts 
these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypal s practices among other remedies 
a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to paypal s practices could expose paypal to significant liability 
any changes to paypal s practices resulting from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend product resources  which could delay other planned product launches or improvements and further harm our business 
if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a cost effective manner  paypal s users may have negative experiences  paypal may receive additional negative publicity  its ability to attract new customers may be damaged and it could become subject to additional litigation 
as a result  current and future revenues could suffer  losses could be incurred and its operating margins may decrease 
our industries are intensely competitive 
marketplaces our marketplaces businesses currently or potentially compete with a large number of companies providing particular categories of goods and or broader ranges of goods 
the internet provides new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the barriers to entry into these channels can be relatively low  and current offline and new competitors  including small businesses who want to create and promote their own stores  can easily launch online sites at nominal cost using commercially available software or partnering with any one of a number of successful ecommerce companies 
moreover  online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other 
consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through our marketplaces businesses have more and more alternatives 
our competitors include the vast majority of traditional department  warehouse  discount and general merchandise stores as well as the online operations of these traditional retailers  online retailers  online classified services and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks 
in the us  these include wal mart  target  sears  macy s  jc penney  costco  office depot  staples  officemax  sam s club  amazon 
com which continues to expand into new geographies and lines of business  buy 
com owned by rakuten  aol 
com  yahoo shopping  msn  qvc and home shopping network  among others 
a number of companies offer a variety of services that provide channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes  including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake  google merchant center  oodle 
com and a number of international websites operated by schibsted asa 
in certain markets  our fixed price listing and traditional auction style listing formats are increasingly being challenged by other formats  such as classifieds 
our classifieds websites  including den bl avis  bilbasen  ebay classifieds including ebay anuncios  ebay kleinanzeigen and ebay annunci  gumtree  kijiji  loquo  marktplaats 
nl  mobile 
de  alamaula and rent 
com  offer classifieds listings in the us and a variety of local international markets 
in many markets in which they operate  including in the us  our classified platforms compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms 
our online shopping comparison site  shopping 
com  competes with sites such as bing shopping  buy 
com  google product search  nextag 
com  pricegrabber 
com  shopzilla and yahoo product search  which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products 
recent legal developments may affect the utility of shopping comparison sites if manufacturers limit variation in product pricing 
in addition  sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels  including the acquisition of new customers by paying for search related advertisements on search engine sites such as bing  google and yahoo 
we use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites  but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations 
we also compete with many local  regional and national specialty retailers and exchanges in each of the major categories of products offered on our site 
for example  category specific competitors to offerings in our consumer electronics  computers  cell phones  digital imaging and video games categories include  among others  abt electronics  amazon 
com  apple  b h photo  best buy  buy 
com  cnet  computer discount warehouse  crutchfield  dell  electronics boutique  fry s electronics  gamestop  hewlett packard  j r music and computer world  lenovo  microwarehouse  overstock 
com  pc connection  pcmall 
com  radio shack  ritz camera  sony  tech depot  tiger direct  ubid  major wireless carriers  and a variety of online and offline computer  consumer electronics  photography and video game retailers 
our international marketplaces websites compete with similar online and offline channels in each of their vertical categories in most countries 
in addition  they compete with general online ecommerce sites such as amazon  quelle and otto in germany  leboncoin 
fr and priceminister owned by rakuten in france  taobao in china  tradus owned by naspers in poland  yahoo kimo in taiwan  lotte  naver and th street in south korea  trading post  oztion and aussie bidder in australia  and amazon and play 
com owned by rakuten in the united kingdom and other countries 
in some of these countries  there are online sites that have much larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do  as well as competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do 
as our businesses in less developed countries grow  we increasingly may compete with domestic competitors which have advantages we do not possess  such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities 
the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers  volume of transactions and price and selection of goods  trust in the seller and the transaction  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include community cohesion  interaction and size  website ease of use and accessibility  system reliability  reliability of delivery and payment  level of service fees  and quality of search tools 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do 
other online ecommerce sites may be acquired by  receive investments from  or enter into other commercial relationships with well established and well financed companies 
as a result  some of our competitors with other revenue sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we can 
some of our competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping  favorable return policies or other transaction related services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for ebay sellers to match 
new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer more efficient or lower cost services 
in addition  certain established retailers may encourage manufacturers to limit or cease distribution of their products to dealers who sell through online channels such as ebay  or may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services 
for example  manufacturers may attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the internet generally  or at prices that would make our site attractive relative to other alternatives 
the adoption by manufacturers of policies  or the adoption of new laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations by government authorities  in each case discouraging the sales of goods or services over the internet  could force ebay users to stop selling certain products on our websites 
increased competition or anti internet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and diminished value of our brands 
as we respond to changes in the competitive environment  we may  from time to time  make pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers  which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability 
although we have established internet traffic arrangements with several large online services and search engine companies  these arrangements may not be renewed on favorable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services 
even if these arrangements are renewed  they may not result in increased usage of our sites 
in addition  companies that control user access to transactions through network access  internet browsers  mobile networks or search engines could promote our competitors  channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites  attempt to restrict access to our sites  or charge us substantial fees for inclusion 
search engines are increasingly becoming a starting point for online shopping  and as the costs of operating an online store continue to decline  online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels  which could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites 
paypal the markets for paypal s product are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change  including but not limited to mobile payments  electronic funds transfer networks starting to allow internet access  cross border access to networks  creation of new networks  expansion of prepaid cards and bill pay networks 
paypal competes with existing online and offline payment methods  including  among others payment card merchant processors that offer their services to online merchants and multi channel merchants  including american express  chase paymentech  first data  wells fargo  worldpay  barclays merchant services  global payments  inc and square  and payment gateways  including cybersource and authorize 
net both owned by visa  money remitters such as moneygram  western union  global payments  inc and euronet  bill payment services  including checkfree  a subsidiary of fiserv  processors that provide online merchants the ability to offer their customers the option of paying for purchases from their bank account or paying on credit  including the newly announced clearxchange joint venture among wells fargo  bank of america and jp morgan chase  acculynk  moneta  ebillme  dwolla  telecheck  a subsidiary of first data  ideal in the netherlands and sofortuberweisung in germany  providers of digital wallet services that offer customers the ability to pay online or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods  including the new v 
me announced by visa  american express s newly launched serve and google wallet  providers of traditional payment methods  particularly credit cards  checks  money orders and automated clearing house transactions  issuers of stored value targeted at online payments  including visabuxx  netspend  green dot  paynearme and ukash  mobile payments  including isis  buyster  mpass  o money and crandy  amazon payments  which offers merchants the ability to accept credit card and bank funded payments from amazon s base of online and mobile customers on the merchant s own website  google checkout recently integrated into the google wallet service  which enables the online and mobile payment of merchants using credit cards  alipay  an online payment services provider which operates primarily in china but has announced plans to expand internationally  other providers of online account based payments  such as skrill and clickandbuy primarily in the eu  paymate and visa payclick in australia  payment services targeting users of social networks and online gaming  including facebook and hi credits  playspan which visa has acquired and boku  payment services enabling banks to offer their online banking customers the ability to send and receive payments through their bank account  including zashpay from fiserv and popmoney from cashedge  both of which have announced collaboration agreements with visa fiserv recently acquired cashedge  and online shopping services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider  such as visa s rightcliq  mastercard marketplace  trialpay and tapjoy 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  customer service and other resources  greater name recognition  or a larger base of customers in affiliated businesses than paypal 
paypal s competitors may respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal 
some of these competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing  anti money laundering  counter terrorist financing and other regulatory requirements than paypal  which is subject to additional regulations based on  among other factors  its licensure as a bank in luxembourg 
they may devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of products and services than paypal  and they may offer lower prices 
for example  google checkout has in the past offered free payments processing on transactions in an amount proportionate to certain advertising spending with google 
competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal 
in addition  in certain countries  such as germany  netherlands and australia  electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions 
as in the us  established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service 
the principal competitive factors for paypal include the following ability to attract and retain both buyers and sellers with relatively low marketing expense  ability to show that sellers will achieve incremental sales by offering paypal  security of transactions and the ability for buyers to use paypal without sharing their financial information with the seller  low fees and simplicity of fee structure  ability to develop services across multiple commerce channels  including mobile payments and payments at the physical point of sale  trust in paypal s dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programs  customer service  and brand recognition 
with respect to our online competition  additional competitive factors include website ease of use and accessibility  system reliability  data security  and quality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits 
some of paypal s competitors  such as wells fargo  first data  american express and royal bank of scotland  also provide processing or foreign exchange services to paypal 
if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers  either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition  these processing and foreign exchange relationships could be negatively affected  or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for paypal to deliver its services 
gsi our gsi business segment has two main businesses ecommerce services and interactive marketing services 
ecommerce services the market for the development and operation of ecommerce services that enable companies to operate ecommerce businesses and integrate their ecommerce businesses into their multichannel retail offerings is continuously evolving and intensely competitive 
in our ecommerce services business  we face competition from in house ecommerce solutions  technology and service providers which supply one or more components of an ecommerce solution  and other providers of integrated ecommerce solutions 
many of our prospective ecommerce services clients evaluate managing all or some aspects of an ecommerce operation with internal resources 
as a result  we often compete with in house solutions promoted and supported by internal information technology staffs  merchandising groups  and other internal corporate constituencies as well as with technology and service providers that supply one or more components of an ecommerce solution that allow prospective clients to develop and operate their ecommerce business in house 
this group of providers may include the prospective client itself and companies that offer web platforms eg  art technology group which is owned by oracle  ibm  demandware and microsoft  customer care call center services eg  west communications  sykes enterprises  and convergys  fulfillment and logistics eg  pfs web  innotrac  dhl  and ups  and systems integrators and technology providers eg  accenture  eds  sapient  infosys  oracle and ibm 
we believe that we compete with ecommerce services competitors primarily on the basis of the following offering the choice of a complete integrated solution or a component based solution  promoting the client s brand and business  rather than our own  providing scale and operating leverage with an enterprise focus  establishing a commitment to invest in and enhance our platform  and aligning our financial interests with those of our clients 
interactive marketing services the market for interactive marketing services is continuously evolving and intensely competitive 
in our interactive marketing services business  we face competition from other providers of interactive marketing services  other providers of traditional marketing services and in house marketing departments  as our prospective interactive marketing services clients evaluate managing their marketing services with internal resources as well as through interactive marketing agencies 
as a result  we often compete with in house solutions promoted and supported by internal marketing departments as well as with service providers that supply one or more interactive marketing services 
this group of providers may include the prospective client itself and companies that offer email management and data aggregation eg  experian  harte hanks and epsilon  online marketing and design services digital marketing services agencies such as omnicom group  wpp group  publicis and the interpublic group of companies  and other interactive marketing services eg  google  linkshare owned by rakuten  tradedoubler  and valueclick 
low barriers to entry in the interactive marketing industry could also increase the number of competitors our interactive marketing services business may face 
we believe that we compete with interactive marketing services competitors primarily on the basis of the following offering digital marketing solutions that are integrated with our ecommerce services platform  which we believe provides a more strategic  cohesive and optimized approach to growing ecommerce businesses  and providing services that utilize proprietary technology to promote stronger customer engagement designed to increase clients return on investment 
our ecommerce services and interactive marketing services businesses have competitors with longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
those competitors may be able to secure components of their technology and services on more favorable terms and devote more resources to technology development and marketing than our ecommerce services and interactive marketing services business 
in addition  as we expand our ecommerce services and interactive marketing services businesses internationally  we will face increased competition from local companies which may have a greater understanding of  and focus on  the local customer 
we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 
we receive scrutiny from various government agencies under us and foreign competition laws 
some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti competitive conduct 
other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us or other countries  or otherwise constitute unfair competition 
contractual agreements with buyers  sellers  or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation 
also  our unilateral business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation 
some regulators  particularly those outside of the us  may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive 
for example  in the us  we have been sued by a plaintiff representing a putative class of sellers who alleges that we have illegally monopolized a market for online auctions 
in korea  the national competition authority has investigated allegations that we have engaged in illegal exclusive conduct and rendered a decision against us in october the case is on appeal through two administrative lawsuits  and a further investigation has now been concluded by the seoul prosecutor s office  which has chosen not to bring any charges 
the competition authorities in germany and australia have conducted investigations now completed of various actions taken by our businesses 
such claims and investigations  even if without foundation  typically are very expensive to defend  involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort  and could result in significant judgments against us 
in several jurisdictions  we have taken actions designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites 
beginning in june  we have required users in the uk to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized uk website  and since october  we have required sellers on ebay 
com to accept one or more accepted payment methods currently paypal  credit or debit cards processed through internet merchant accounts  propay  moneybookers and paymate and no longer allow any forms of paper payment  including checks and money orders  to be listed by sellers in the us for most categories of items 
while these initiatives are intended to improve and make safer our users buying experience and or increase activity on our sites  certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes  and may allege that we have and are abusing market power 
we currently face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to such actions 
for example  in  both the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods 
we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future 
negative reactions to these changes by our users or government authorities could  among other things  force us to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business  operating results and profitability 
our business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites  including seasonal factors  national events and increased usage of other websites 
anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites could adversely affect our business 
we would therefore be adversely affected by geopolitical events such as war  the threat of war  or terrorist activity  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes 
similarly  our results of operations historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations because many of our users reduce their activities on our websites with the onset of good weather during the summer months  and on and around national holidays 
in particular  our gsi business is highly seasonal  with the fourth quarter holiday season accounting for a disproportionate amount of gsi s net revenues due to consumers increasing their purchases and businesses increasing their advertising to consumers during that period  and any factors that limit or dampen consumer spending during the fourth quarter holiday season could harm our gsi business 
in addition  increased usage of social networking or other entertainment websites may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites  which could adversely affect our financial results 
our failure to cost effectively manage certain aspects of our business could harm us 
we have expanded our headcount  facilities and infrastructure in the us and internationally  and anticipate that further expansion in certain areas will be required for some of our businesses 
we are also increasing our product and service offerings 
this expansion increases the complexity of our businesses and has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational  and financial resources 
the areas that are put under strain by our growth include the following customer account billing 
our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes 
our failure to grow our transaction processing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our and our subsidiaries websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenue 
customer service 
we continue to focus on providing better and more efficient customer support to our users 
we intend to provide an increased level of support including an increasing amount of telephone support in a cost effective manner 
if we are unable to provide customer support in a cost effective manner  users of our websites may have negative experiences  current and future revenues could suffer  our costs may increase and our operating margins may decrease 
we must continue to effectively hire  train and manage new employees 
if our new hires perform poorly  if we are unsuccessful in hiring  training  managing and integrating new employees  or if we are unsuccessful in retaining our existing employees  our business may be harmed 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we will need to improve our transaction processing  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different and incompatible systems 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost base  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment  and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
like many other multinational corporations  we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate 
our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities  and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations  audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world  including with respect to our tax structure 
any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 
while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities  these reserves may prove to be insufficient in the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our positions 
in addition  the economic downturn reduced tax revenues for us federal and state governments  and a number of proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities are being considered at various levels of government 
among the options have been a range of proposals included in the tax and budget policies recommended to the us congress by the us department of the treasury to modify the federal tax rules related to the imposition of us federal corporate income taxes for companies operating in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
if such proposals are enacted into law  this could increase our effective tax rate 
a number of us states have likewise attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state 
many us states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income loss attributable to their state from certain out of state businesses 
companies that operate over the internet  such as ebay  are a target of some of these state efforts 
if more states are successful in applying direct taxes to internet companies that do not have a physical presence in the state  this could increase our effective tax rate 
our integrated x 
commerce platform  which is open to third party developers  subjects us to additional risks 
in  we launched the paypal developer platform to enable third party developers to access a wide variety of paypal product and programming code specifications and to connect to select paypal payment application programming interfaces apis 
we also began providing a software tool kit for building mobile payments applications  and enabling third party developers to access certain apis with respect to our marketplaces platforms 
in june  we launched x 
commerce  our integrated open commerce platform initiative  which includes our ebay developer program  the paypal developer network and magento  which provides open source ecommerce platforms and which we acquired in august there can be no assurance that third party developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open commerce platforms on a timely basis or at all  and a number of factors could cause such third party developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms 
in addition  our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions  which may be contravened by such third party applications 
if this were to occur  we could be liable for the regulatory failure and our business could be adversely affected 
there are risks associated with our indebtedness 
at december   we had billion in unsecured indebtedness outstanding  as well as billion of available borrowing capacity under our existing commercial paper program and unsecured revolving credit facility after adjusting for capacity maintained in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  including under our revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities 
our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences  including  without limitation  the following we will be required to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required to  among other things seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures  or reduce or delay planned operating expenditures 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 
we depend on the continued growth of online commerce 
the business of selling goods over the internet and mobile networks  particularly through online trading  is dynamic and relatively new 
concerns about fraud  privacy and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet or mobile devices as a medium of commerce 
in countries such as the us  germany  korea and the uk  where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our services is high  acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past 
moreover  the growth rates of internet users is slowing in many countries where we have a significant presence 
in order to expand our user base  we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer internet analogues to such traditional retail means  such as the retailer s own website  to our offerings 
if these consumers prove to be less active than our earlier users due to lower levels of willingness to use the internet or mobile devices for commerce for any reason  including lack of access to high speed communications equipment  congestion of traffic on the internet  internet or mobile network outages or delays  disruptions or other damage to users computers or mobile devices  and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs  including our cost of acquiring new customers  our business could be adversely impacted 
our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet  as well as access to mobile networks 
internet service providers may be able to block  degrade  or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings  which could harm our business 
our customers rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to use our products and services 
in many cases  that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings  including incumbent telephone companies  cable companies  mobile communications companies and large internet service providers 
some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade  disrupt  or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings  or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings 
mobile operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on our ability to offer our mobile applications in their mobile application stores 
internet service providers or mobile networks could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings 
worldwide  a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions 
the united states federal communications commission enacted rules in december preserving the open internet broadband industry practices 
fcc establishing baseline restrictions that would regulate the ability of internet access companies to interfere with internet traffic transported over wired and wireless networks 
these fcc rules are expected to be reviewed by the federal courts in pending greater regulatory and judicial clarity  any interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings  whether paid by us or by our customers  could cause us to lose existing customers  impair our ability to attract new customers and harm our revenue and growth 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the success of our services will depend largely on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security  as well as timely development of complementary products  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support such demands 
in addition  increasing numbers of users  increasing bandwidth requirements  or problems caused by viruses  worms  malware and similar programs may harm the performance of the internet 
the backbone computers of the internet have been the targets of such programs 
from time to time  the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure 
any such outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services  which could adversely impact our business 
we may be unable to protect or enforce our own intellectual property rights adequately 
we regard the protection of our intellectual property  including our trademarks particularly those covering the ebay and paypal names  patents  copyrights  domain names  trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success 
we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal  state and common law rights in the us and internationally  as well as a variety of administrative procedures 
we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available  and contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our technology or deter independent development of equivalent or superior technologies or other intellectual property rights by others 
we pursue the registration of our domain names  trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally 
additionally  we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology 
effective trademark  copyright  patent  domain name  trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation 
we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions  a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location 
we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to others 
these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation 
we are subject to the risks of owning real property 
we own real property  including land and buildings related to our operations 
we have little experience in managing real property 
ownership of this property subjects us to a number of additional risks  including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems  disruptions to our operations resulting from possible natural disasters  interruptions in utilities and similar events  adverse changes in the value of these properties due to interest rate changes  changes in the commercial property markets  or other factors  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning  seismic  disability law  or other requirements  and possible disputes with tenants  neighboring owners  or others 
some anti takeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or take control of our board of directors 
these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder as defined by delaware law for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
item b unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties we own and lease various properties in the us and other countries around the world 
we use the properties for executive and administrative offices  data centers  product development offices  fulfillment centers and customer service offices 
as of december   our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage as follows united states other countries total in millions owned facilities leased facilities total facilities we also own approximately acres of land in utah that could be developed if necessary to accommodate future growth 
our corporate headquarters are located in san jose  california and occupy approximately million square feet 
as of december   the total square footage generally used by each of our reportable segments was as follows marketplaces payments gsi total in millions total facilities from time to time we consider various alternatives related to long term facilities needs 
while we believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs  it may become necessary to develop and improve land we own or lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth 
item legal proceedings overview we are involved in legal proceedings on an ongoing basis 
if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements 
if only a range of estimated losses can be determined  we accrue an amount within the range that  in our judgment  reflects the most likely outcome  if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the low end of the range 
amounts accrued for legal proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended december  except as otherwise noted  we have concluded that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings ie  monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement in excess of our accruals are also not material 
for those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable  we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding ie  monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement are not material 
if we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding  we have disclosed that fact 
in assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding  we evaluate  among other factors  the amount of monetary damages claimed  as well as the potential impact of non monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs eg  injunctive relief that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business 
with respect to the matters disclosed in this item legal proceedings  we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non monetary remedies 
specific matters in august  louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture filed two lawsuits in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
among other things  the complaint alleged that we violated french tort law by negligently broadcasting listings posted by third parties offering counterfeit items bearing plaintiffs trademarks and by purchasing certain advertising keywords 
around september  parfums christian dior  kenzo parfums  parfums givenchy  and guerlain soci t also filed a lawsuit in the paris court of commerce against ebay inc and ebay international ag 
the complaint alleged that we had interfered with the selective distribution network the plaintiffs established in france and the european union by allowing third parties to post listings offering genuine perfumes and cosmetics for sale on our websites 
in june  the paris court of commerce ruled that ebay and ebay international ag were liable for failing to prevent the sale of counterfeit items on its websites that traded on plaintiffs brand names and for interfering with the plaintiffs selective distribution network 
the court awarded plaintiffs approximately eur million in damages and issued an injunction enforceable by daily fines of up to eur  prohibiting all sales of perfumes and cosmetics bearing the dior  guerlain  givenchy and kenzo brands over all worldwide ebay sites to the extent that they are accessible from france 
we appealed this decision  and in september  the paris court of appeal reduced the damages award to eur million and modified the injunction 
we have further appealed this decision to the french supreme court 
in  plaintiffs filed an action regarding our compliance with the original injunction  and in november  the court awarded the plaintiffs eur million the equivalent of eur  per day and indicated that as a large internet company we should do a better job of enforcing the injunction 
parfums christian dior has filed another motion relating to our compliance with the injunction 
we have taken measures to comply with the injunction and have appealed these rulings  noting  among other things  the modification of the initial injunction 
however  these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices  which could lower our revenue  increase our costs  or make our websites less convenient to our customers 
any such results could materially harm our business 
other brand owners have also filed suit against us or have threatened to do so in numerous different jurisdictions  seeking to hold us liable for  among other things  alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by third parties  tester and other not for resale consumer products listed on our websites by third parties  alleged misuse of trademarks in listings  alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws  alleged violations of parallel import laws  alleged non compliance with consumer protection laws and in connection with paid search advertisements 
we have prevailed in some of these suits  lost in others  and many are in various stages of appeal 
we continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses to these suits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in may  the uk high court of justice ruled in the case filed by l or al sa  lanc me parfums et beaut cie  laboratoire garnier cie and l or al uk ltd against ebay international ag  other ebay companies  and several ebay sellers no 
hcco that ebay was not jointly liable with the seller co defendants as a joint tortfeasor  and indicated that it would certify to the european court of justice ecj questions of liability for the use of l or al trademarks  hosting liability  and the scope of a possible injunction against intermediaries 
on july  the ecj ruled on the questions certified by the uk high court of justice 
it held that a brand names could be used by marketplaces as keywords for paid search advertising without violating a trademark owner s rights if it were clear to consumers that the goods reached via the key word link were not being offered by the trademark owner or its designees but instead by third parties  b that marketplaces could invoke the limitation from liability provided by article of the ecommerce directive if they did not take such an active role with respect to the listings in question that the limitation would not be available  but that even where the limitation was available  the marketplace could be liable if it had awareness through notice or its own investigation of the illegality of the listings  c that a marketplace would be liable in a specific jurisdiction only if the offers on the site at issue were targeting that jurisdiction  a question of fact  d that injunctions may be issued to a marketplace in connection with infringing third party content  but that such injunctions must be proportionate and not block legitimate trade and e that trademark rights can only be evoked by a rights owner as a result of a seller s commercial activity as opposed to private activity 
the matter will now return to the uk high court of justice for further action in light of the ecj opinion 
the case was originally filed in july l or al s complaint alleged that we were jointly liable for trademark infringement for the actions of the sellers who allegedly sold counterfeit goods  parallel imports and testers not for resale products 
additionally  l or al claimed that ebay s use of l or al brands on its website  in its search engine and in sponsored links  and purchase of l or al trademarks as keywords  constitute trademark infringement 
the suit sought an injunction preventing future infringement  full disclosure of the identity of all past and present sellers of infringing l or al goods  and a declaration that our verified rights owner vero program as then operated was insufficient to prevent such infringement 
the scope of a possible injunction claimed is to be specified after the trial upon remand from the ecj 
ebay s korean subsidiary  iac which has merged into gmarket and is now named ebay korea  has notified its approximately million users of a january data breach involving personally identifiable information including name  address  resident registration number and some transaction and refund data but not including credit card information or real time banking information 
approximately  users have sued iac over this breach in several lawsuits in korean courts and more may do so in the future 
trial for a group of four representative suits began in august in the seoul district court  and trial for a group of other suits began in september in the seoul district court 
there is some precedent in korea for a court to grant consolation money for data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the breach 
such precedents have involved payments of up to approximately per user 
in january  the seoul district court ruled that iac had met its obligations with respect to defending the site from intrusion and  accordingly  had no liability for the breach 
this ruling has been appealed by approximately  plaintiffs to the seoul high court  where it is currently being heard de novo 
a decision is expected in general matters other third parties have from time to time claimed  and others may claim in the future  that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
we are subject to patent disputes  and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces  payments and gsi businesses as our services continue to expand in scope and complexity 
such claims may be brought directly against our companies and or against our customers who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us  and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our recent acquisitions  particularly in cases where we are entering into new businesses in connection with such acquisitions 
we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims 
we may also become more vulnerable to third party claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act  the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts  and as we expand the range and geographical scope of our services and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable 
we believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent  copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us 
intellectual property claims  whether meritorious or not  are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve  could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business  or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms 
from time to time  we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business  including suits by our users individually or as class actions alleging  among other things  improper disclosure of our prices  rules or policies  that our prices  rules  policies or customer user agreements violate applicable law  or that we have not acted in conformity with such prices  rules  policies or agreements 
the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing 
any claims or regulatory actions against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  damage awards including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions  injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement  require us to change our business practices in expensive ways  require significant amounts of management time  result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business

our diluted earnings per share increased to in  a increase compared to  driven primarily by a gain resulting from the sale of our remaining interest in skype and growth in net revenue  partially offset by the impact of a loss on a divested business  acquisitions and a higher tax rate 
we generated cash flow from operations of approximately billion in compared to billion in our marketplaces segment total net revenues increased million  or  in compared to the increase in total net revenues was driven primarily by a year over year increase in gmv excluding vehicles of  the acquisition of brandsfriends in the first quarter of and an increase in revenue attributable to our classifieds and advertising businesses

outlook we expect our payments business to continue its strong performance from expanded merchant coverage and share of checkout 
in addition  we expect solid performance from our marketplaces business in its core markets with continued investment in its platform and new products 
finally  we expect strong performance from our gsi business driven by operational improvements and the realization of synergies 
results of operations summary of net revenues we generate two types of net revenues net transaction revenues and marketing services and other revenues 
our net transaction revenues are derived principally from listing fees and final value fees which are fees payable on transactions completed on our marketplaces trading platforms  fees paid by merchants for payment processing services and ecommerce service fees 
our marketing services revenues are derived principally from the sale of advertisements  revenue sharing arrangements  classifieds fees  marketing service fees and lead referral fees 
other revenues are derived principally from interest and fees earned on the bill me later portfolio of receivables from loans  interest earned on certain paypal customer account balances and fees from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users

commerce initiative  which was launched in conjunction with our acquisition of magento in the third quarter of revenues are attributed to us and international geographies based primarily upon the country in which the seller  payment recipient  customer  website that displays advertising  or other service provider  or until the sale of skype on november   the skype user s internet protocol address  as the case may be  is located 
because we generated the majority of our net revenues internationally in recent periods  including the years ended december   and  we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under item a risk factors 
in that regard  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations 
we have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies  however  the effectiveness of this program in mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations varies from period to period  and in any given period  our operating results are usually affected  sometimes significantly  by changes in currency exchange rates 
fluctuations in exchange rates also directly affect our cross border revenue 
we calculate the year over year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts 
for the year ended december   foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately million net of a million negative impact from hedging activities relating to paypal s net revenue compared to the prior year

net revenues attributable to the gsi segment are reflected beginning from june  the date the acquisition of gsi was completed 
we expect transaction activity patterns on our websites to mirror general consumer buying patterns

the fourth calendar quarter typically accounts for a disproportionate amount of gsi s total annual revenue because consumers increase their purchases and businesses increase their advertising to consumers during the fourth quarter holiday season

amortization of acquired intangible assets from time to time we have purchased  and we expect to continue to purchase  assets and businesses 
these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in our amortization expense in periods subsequent to acquisition 
we amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit  using the straight line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years

see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation 
our provision for income taxes is volatile and  in general  is adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates 
our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of a substantial portion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest those earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these earnings were distributed into the united states in the form of dividends to ebay companies domiciled in the united states or otherwise  or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
further  as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments  our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax 
our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 
from time to time  we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings 
we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions  including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives and the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure  as well as the long term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses 
these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and or result in additional cash tax payments 
the impact in any period may be significant 
these transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate

as a result of this transaction  we made a cash payment for taxes of approximately million during the first quarter of we are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally 
we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations  although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations 
due to the ongoing tax examinations  we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities we generated cash from operating activities in amounts greater than net income in  and  due primarily to gains on the sale of skype and acquisitions and non cash charges to earnings partially offset by changes in working capital

these proceeds were partially offset by cash outflows of million to repurchase our common stock and million paid for tax withholdings related to the net share settlements of restricted stock awards and units 
the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during  and was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
stock repurchases in september  our board authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock  with no expiration from the date of authorization  for the purpose of offsetting the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs

the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including corporate and regulatory requirements  price and other market conditions and management s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash 
the programs are intended to comply with the volume  timing and other limitations set forth in rule b under the securities exchange act of shelf registration statement at december   we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities  such as fixed or floating rate notes  us dollar or foreign currency denominated notes  redeemable notes  global notes  and dual currency or other indexed notes 
issuances under the shelf registration will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued 
the registration statement does not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued thereunder 
our ability to issue debt securities is subject to market conditions and other factors impacting our borrowing capacity  including our credit ratings 
in october  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured debt securities under a prior shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering 
these debt securities remain outstanding and consist of million aggregate principal amount of notes due  million aggregate principal amount of notes due and million aggregate principal amount of notes due the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued includes customary covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur  assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease back transactions with respect to specified properties  and also includes customary events of default

we may also  subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders  increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to billion 
funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement replaced our prior billion unsecured revolving credit agreement  dated november  as of december   no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under our billion credit agreement 
however  as described above  we have a billion commercial paper program and we maintain billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due 
accordingly  at december   billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement

the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on november   unless a the commitments are terminated earlier  either at our request or  if an event of default occurs  by the lenders or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy related events of default  or b the maturity date is extended upon our request  subject to the agreement of the lenders 
the credit agreement contains customary representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  including a financial covenant  events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks 
the negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens  subject to certain exceptions 
the financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement 
notes payable and capital lease obligations in addition to the debt described above  as of december   we had notes payable of million and capital lease obligations of million that were assumed as part of our gsi acquisition 
commitments and contingencies as of december   approximately billion of unused credit was available to bill me later accountholders 
the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of bill me later credit products based on  among other things  account usage and customer creditworthiness 
when a consumer makes a purchase using a bill me later credit product the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer  funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant 
we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and  as a result of the purchase  bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults 
although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account  we own the related receivable  and bill me later is responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 
we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes 
changes in our business needs  contractual cancellation provisions  fluctuating interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments 
the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments in thousands payments due during the year ending december  debt leases purchase obligations total thereafter the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments 
for additional details related to our debt  please see note debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non cancelable operating leases for office facilities  fulfillment centers  as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 
purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising  capital expenditures computer equipment  software applications  engineering development services  construction contracts and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits  net  the table does not include million of such non current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  liquidity and capital resource requirements at december   we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents  as well as time deposits and fixed income securities classified as short term investments  in an aggregate amount of billion  compared to billion at december  at december   this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately billion 
if these assets were distributed to the us  we may be subject to additional us taxes in certain circumstances 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions and money market funds that hold these assets  primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions and money market funds in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or money market funds fail or encounter difficulties 
to date  we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts  these cash balances could be adversely impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to the extent that our bill me later products become more widely available through improved and more comprehensive product integrations with ebay  paypal and other channels  and as we further promote bill me later products  we expect customer adoption and usage of bill me later products to expand 
any resulting growth in the portfolio of bill me later loan receivables would increase our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect the bill me later business 
we currently fund the expansion of the bill me later portfolio of loan receivables with borrowings and domestic and international cash resources 
from time to time  we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings 
for example  in  we completed a legal entity restructuring that resulted in a cash payment for taxes of approximately million in the first quarter of we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions  including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives and the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure  as well as the long term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses 
these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and or result in additional cash tax payments 
the impact in any period may be significant 
these transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program  and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  anticipated capital expenditures  bill me later portfolio of loan receivables and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in europe  we have two cash pooling arrangements with a financial institution for cash management purposes 
these arrangements allow for cash withdrawals from this financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held in europe within the same financial institution aggregate cash deposits for more efficient cash management and investment purposes 
these arrangements also allow us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed upon limit 
the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income 
as of december   we had a total of billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the same financial institution under these cash pooling arrangements 
based on differences in regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where paypal operates  paypal holds customer balances either as direct claims against paypal or as an agent or custodian on behalf of paypal s customers 
customer balances held as direct claims against paypal or as an agent or custodian on behalf of our customers are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
these off balance sheet funds totaled approximately billion as of december  and these funds include funds held on behalf of us customers that are deposited in bank accounts insured by the fdic subject to applicable limits 
additionally  please see the information in item a risk factors under the caption if our payments business is found to be subject to or in violation of any laws or regulations  including those governing money transmission  electronic funds transfers  money laundering  counter terrorist financing  sanctions  banking and lending  it could be subject to liability  licensure and regulatory approval and may be forced to change its business practices 
indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business  we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations  including our standard marketing  promotions and application programming interface license agreements 
under these contracts  we generally indemnify  hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names  trademarks  logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement 
gsi in many of its major ecommerce agreements has provided an indemnity for other types of third party claims  which are indemnities mainly related to various intellectual property rights  and we have provided similar indemnities in a limited number of agreements for our other businesses 
in our paypal business  we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal or paypal customers 
in connection with the sale of skype  we made certain customary warranties to the buyer in the purchase agreement 
our liability to the buyer for inaccuracies in these warranties is generally subject to certain limitations 
with respect to certain specified litigation matters involving skype that were pending as of the closing of the transaction  we also agreed  among other things  to bear of the cost of any monetary judgment that is rendered in respect of those matters 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision 
to date  losses recorded in our statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant  either individually or collectively 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this report 
provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs  fraud  chargebacks and merchant credit losses  bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance  and loan reserves associated with our loan receivables balance 
our provision for transaction and loan loss expense fluctuates depending on many factors  including macroeconomic conditions  our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes 
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction and loan losses as a percentage of net revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  net revenues provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses as a of net revenues determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and is subject to numerous estimates and judgments  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date 
an aggregate basis point deviation from our provision for transaction and loan losses as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million in  resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims  we have estimated the range of probable loss  net of expected recoveries  and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in item a risk factors  item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us  and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
however  even if successful  our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management s time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims  we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees  modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of any or all of our business segments 
accounting for income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings 
in addition to local country tax laws and regulations  our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by management s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 
at december   billion of earnings had been indefinitely reinvested outside the u 
s  primarily in active non us business operations 
we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations and  accordingly  we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding these on these earnings 
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors  including our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap  pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 
the following table illustrates our effective tax rates for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  provision for income taxes as a of income before income taxes our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  as well as various state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately million  resulting in an approximate change in diluted earnings per share 
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue transactions  primarily related to advertising contracts  that are considered multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables  developing an estimate of the stand alone selling price of each deliverable  whether revenue should be reported gross as ebay is acting as a principal  or net as ebay is acting as an agent  when we provide cash consideration to our customers  determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer s purchase of our products and or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred 
changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates 
these judgments can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
at december   our goodwill totaled billion and our identifiable intangible assets  net totaled billion 
we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by our management 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august  and as a result of this test we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required 
see note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as of december   we determined that no events or circumstances from august  through december  indicated that a further assessment was necessary 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards over the service period for awards expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense recognized for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
see note stock based and employee savings plans to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant 
we calculated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of additional variables described below 
the use of a black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of assumptions  including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
as a result  future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during  and was  and per share  respectively  using the black scholes model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected life in years dividend yield expected volatility our computation of expected volatility for  and was based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our stock 
our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating forfeitures  including employee class and historical experience 
recent accounting pronouncements see note the company and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  british pound  korean won  australian dollar and canadian dollar  subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs 
in addition  we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services provided by ebay and by paypal 
our cash flow  results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities 
we have a foreign exchange exposure management program that aims to identify material foreign currency exposures  to manage these exposures  and to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts 
these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments 
for additional details related to our derivative instruments  please see note derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of available for sale securities  including money market funds and government and corporate securities 
as of december   approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in bank deposits and money market funds 
as such  changes in interest rates will impact our interest income 
in addition  we regularly issue new commercial paper notes to repay outstanding commercial paper notes as they mature  and those new commercial paper notes bear interest at rates prevailing at the time of issuance 
accordingly  changes in interest rates will impact interest expense or cost of net revenues 
as of december   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgage backed securities 
for additional details related to our investment activities  please see note investments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interest rate risk than fixed rate securities  floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the balance of our fixed income investments was billion  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio 
as of december   our fixed income investments earned an average pretax yield of approximately  with a weighted average maturity of months 
if interest rates at the end of the year were basis points higher lower  the fair market value of our total fixed income investment portfolio as of december  could have decreased increased by approximately million 
investment risk as of december   our cost and equity method investments totaled million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to equity method investments in companies 
we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is other than temporary 
our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends  recent sales acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data 
during  we did not record any material impairment on our cost or equity method investments 
on october   microsoft corp 
completed its acquisition of skype and we received approximately billion in cash for our interest in skype  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately billion 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk on marketable equity instruments due to market volatility 
at december   the total fair value of our marketable equity instruments was million  which represented approximately of our total cash and investment portfolio and was primarily related to our equity holdings in mercadolibre 
european debt exposures we actively monitor our exposure to the european markets  including the impact of sovereign debt issues associated with greece  ireland  portugal  italy and spain 
as of december   we do not have any direct or indirect investments in the sovereign debt  corporations  or financial institutions of these countries 
we do maintain a small number of operating bank accounts with spanish and italian banks that have immaterial balances
