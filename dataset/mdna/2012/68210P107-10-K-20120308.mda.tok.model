company overview business 
the company operates through four primary subsidiaries omega protein  inc  omega shipyard  inc  cyvex nutrition  inc 
and incon processing  llc omega protein  inc omega protein  which is the company s principal operating subsidiary  operates in the menhaden harvesting and processing business and is 
table of contents the successor to a business conducted since omega shipyard  inc omega shipyard owns and operates a drydock facility in moss point  mississippi that is used to provide shoreside maintenance for omega protein s fishing fleet and  subject to outside demand and excess capacity  occasionally for third party vessels 
cyvex nutrition  inc cyvex  founded in and acquired by the company on december   is located in irvine  california and participates in the nutraceutical industry as an ingredient provider 
incon processing  llc incon  acquired by the company on september   is located in batavia  illinois and is a specialty toll processor that utilizes molecular distillation technology to concentrate a variety of compound products  including omega fish oils 
revenues from omega shipyard and incon for third party work were not material in the company also has a number of other immaterial direct and indirect subsidiaries 
fishing 
omega protein is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
omega protein s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
omega protein s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
omega protein s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production  feed production  certain industrial applications as well as dietary supplements 
fish solubles are sold as attractants for animal feeds and baits and as fertilizers 
omega protein s harvesting season generally extends from early may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from mid april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  omega protein fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal and oil purchased from other suppliers 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at omega protein s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 
on september   omega protein s abbeville and cameron  louisiana fish processing facilities were damaged by hurricane ike 
both of these facilities were non operational immediately after the hurricane 
operations at the abbeville fish processing facility were restored to full capacity on september  the cameron fish processing facility was fully functional prior to the beginning of the fishing season 
these hurricane damages adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the direct impact of the hurricane upon omega protein was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused omega protein to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
omega protein experienced higher costs of production and below average fish catch during the fishing season 
the higher costs of production were primarily attributed to increased energy  labor and repair costs 
the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions mainly associated with hurricane activity 
the impacts of higher cost inventories were carried forward and adversely affected the company s earnings through the second quarter of during  omega protein reduced overall costs of production by approximately million as compared to by lowering and  in some cases  eliminating certain expenses  renegotiating more favorable vendor contracts  and fixing energy prices via energy swaps more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  due to lower than average fish catch  omega protein continued to experience higher per unit product costs which contributed to lower than anticipated company earnings for the second half of in addition  the lower than average fish catch resulted in lower product volumes available for sale in the first half of these higher cost product inventories carried forward from the fishing season were largely sold as of june  
table of contents during  omega protein experienced abnormally below average fish catch in the gulf of mexico from the months of june to september as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster 
the gulf of mexico below average fish catch was partially mitigated by an above average fish catch in the atlantic for the fishing season and an above average fish catch in the gulf of mexico for the month of october  once the majority of the fishing restrictions were lifted as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster and fishing conditions returned to normal 
the overall decrease in fish catch negatively impacted omega protein s inventory available to sell during the second half of and its per unit product costs 
the high per unit product costs were partially offset by million in emergency payments from the gulf coast claims facility gccf which were received during see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster 
in  omega protein experienced its highest fish catch since and its highest overall production since the increased level of production contributed to the highest revenues and overall cost of production in the company s history 
low fish oil yields  which were below the company s five year oil yield average  offset some of the positive fish catch impact  resulting in higher per unit product costs 
per unit product costs increased and as compared to and per unit product costs  respectively 
the higher unit product cost inventories from the fishing season are expected to be largely sold by june  harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the omega protein s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch short tons production fish meal short tons oil metric tons crude refined solubles short tons total production omega protein s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which omega protein has no control 
for illustrative purposes  omega protein s total yield for the fishing season was lower compared to the average total yield the previous five fishing seasons 
the company believes that the causes of lower total yields relate to fish diet  weather and water temperature but such causes are not generally well understood 
poor total yields result in increased per unit inventory costs and fewer volumes available for future sale and  as a result  have at times materially impacted the amount of products that omega protein has been able to produce from its available fish catch 
markets 
pricing for omega protein s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  omega protein has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
additionally  the company continues to market its refined fish oil to food manufactures and other related industries 
omega protein has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure and omegaactiv or how long it may take to develop these markets 

table of contents during and  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions and other factors such as the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster  and omega protein expanded its purchase and resale of other fish meals and oils primarily us  panamanian  peruvian  moroccan  and mexican fish meal and us menhaden oil 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from omega protein s base domestic production  these operations provide omega protein with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets  some of which  omega protein has not historically had a presence 
during the year ended december   omega protein purchased approximately  tons of fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
during the year ended december   omega protein purchased approximately  tons of fish meal  or approximately of fish meal sales volumes for the same period 
the company did not purchase any fish meal or fish oil during omega protein sells a portion of its products on a two to twelve month forward contract basis with the balance sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
omega protein s sales contracts generally contain force majeure and other production allocation provisions 
during and as a result of the gulf of mexico oil spill disaster  omega protein purchased additional fish meal from a third party to supplement its production and received partial reimbursement from bp through the gccf for additional costs associated with this purchase 
historically  fish meal and fish oil sold on a forward contract basis has fluctuated from year to year based upon perceived market availability and forward price expectations 
as of december   omega protein had sold forward on a contract basis approximately  tons of fish meal and  tons of fish oil for as a basis of comparison  as of december   omega protein had sold forward on a contract basis approximately  tons of fish meal and  tons of fish oil for omega protein s annual revenues are highly dependent on pricing  annual fish catch  production yields and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year 
omega protein determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on existing contracts  prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
omega protein s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  omega protein attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
omega protein s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and  therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal
