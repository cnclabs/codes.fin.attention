item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under specific allocations 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention are deemed to be special mention 
management s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of estimated valuation allowances is subject to review by the occ  the bank s primary regulator  which can also order the establishment of additional specific or general loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the loan portfolio  will not request us to materially adjust our allowance for loan losses 
the occ  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management believes it has established an adequate estimated allowance for probable loan losses 
management reviews its process quarterly and makes changes as needed  and reports those results at meetings of our audit committee 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the loan portfolio  would not request us to materially adjust our allowance for loan losses at the time of their examination 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
management defines potential problem loans as performing loans rated substandard  that do not meet the definition of a nonperforming loan 
these potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management 

table of contents v 
deposits the following table sets forth the amount and maturities of deposits of  or more at december  months or less over months through months over months through months over months vi 
return on equity and assets the following table presents selected financial ratios as of december  for the years indicated return on average total assets return on average equity average equity to average assets dividend payout ratio vii 
short term borrowings there were no categories of short term borrowings having an average balance greater than of stockholders equity of the company at the end of the year 

table of contents item a risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors the company has incurred a net loss in the past and cannot ensure further losses will not be incurred 
the company incurred a net loss of million for  as well as a net loss of million for and million for in light of the persistent challenging economic environment and continuing depressed real estate markets  we cannot ensure we will not incur future losses 
any future losses may affect our ability to meet our expenses or raise additional capital  and may delay the time in which we can resume dividend payments on our common and preferred stock as well as distributions on our trust preferred securities 
furthermore  any future losses would likely cause a decline in our holding company regulatory capital ratios  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain sufficient capital  whether due to losses  an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance  would be adversely affected 
the company and the bank must meet minimum regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
we also face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution and a participant in the tarp capital purchase program 
our ability to raise additional capital  when and if needed  will depend on conditions in the economy and capital markets  and a number of other factors including investor perceptions regarding the company  banking industry and market condition  and governmental activities many of which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as previously disclosed  in the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the occ in which the bank agreed with the occ to maintain regulatory capital ratios at levels in excess of the general minimums required to be considered well capitalized under applicable occ regulations 
specifically  the bank s board of directors agreed to meet by december   and thereafter maintain  a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the bank achieved these heightened regulatory capital ratios by december  and remained in compliance with them through march  after which we fell out of compliance during as of the may consent order with the occ  which replaced the memorandum of understanding  the bank agreed to maintain the same capital ratios 
the bank was in compliance with the heightened capital requirements required by the occ as of december  however  if the bank fails to be in full compliance with the agreed upon capital ratios in the future  the occ may take additional regulatory enforcement actions 
any such actions could affect customer confidence  our costs of funds  our fdic insurance costs  our ability to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to make distributions on our trust preferred securities  and our ability to grow 
as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents raising additional capital through the sale of equity securities would be dilutive to current stockholders and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional capital to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements and to be able to return to a sustained period of profitability 
with the current low trading price of our common stock  any such capital transaction will likely result in the issuance of a large number of shares of common stock or other securities exercisable into common stock  and may be extremely dilutive to our current common stockholders 
except as our authorized capital stock may be limited by our charter documents  we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of any future issuances of our common stock or other equity securities or the perception that such sales could occur 
liquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations  investment maturities and sales  deposits and funds from sales of capital securities 
additional liquidity is provided by brokered deposits  bank lines of credit  repurchase agreements and the ability to borrow from the reserve bank and the fhlb 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly  such as our overall financial performance  the overall perception of the company s and the bank s ability to return to profitability and restrictions imposed upon us by the regulators  as well as by general factors  such as further disruptions in the economy and financial markets  both domestic and international  or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry 
any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans  invest in securities  meet our expenses  pay dividends to our stockholders  or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  business  results of operations and financial condition 
nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  and could result in further losses in the future 
at december   our nonperforming loans which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due days or more  still accruing interest and restructured loans still accruing interest and our nonperforming assets which include nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned and receivable from swap terminations are reflected in the table below in millions change nonperforming loans oreo receivable from swap terminations nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
for example  we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned has expenses in excess of lease revenues collected  thereby adversely affecting our income and returns on assets and equity 
our loan administration costs also increase and our efficiency ratio is adversely affected 
when we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  we are required to mark the collateral to its then fair market value  which  when compared to the value of the loan  may result in a loss 
these nonperforming loans and other real estate owned also increase our risk profile and the capital our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such 
table of contents risks 
the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
while we have made progress  there is no assurance that we will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future  or that our nonperforming assets will not result in further losses in the future 
we may be subjected to negative publicity that may adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
in the past we have been the subject of news reports discussing our financial situation  and we cannot assure that we may not be subject to negative publicity in the future 
these reports may have a negative impact on our business 
for example  even though our deposits are insured by the fdic  current customers may choose to withdraw their deposits or potential customers may choose to do business elsewhere 
in addition  we may find that our service providers will be reluctant to commit to long term projects with us 
we have deferred interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures and dividends on the series b preferred stock  and the failure to resume payments may adversely affect the company and the stockholders 
in the third quarter of  the company elected to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on million of junior subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities issued by its two statutory trust subsidiaries  old second capital trust i and old second capital trust ii the trust preferred securities 
because of the deferral on the junior subordinated debentures  the trusts have deferred regularly scheduled dividends on the trust preferred securities 
the total accumulated interest on the junior subordinated debentures including compounded interest from july  on the deferred payments totaled million at december  the company has also suspended quarterly cash dividends on its series b preferred stock  issued to the us treasury in connection with the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
dividend payments on the series b preferred stock may be deferred without default  but the dividend is cumulative and therefore will continue to accrue 
the dividends have been deferred since november   and the accumulated series b preferred stock dividends totaled million at december  the company is allowed to defer payments of interest for quarterly periods on the junior subordinated debentures without default or penalty  but such amounts will continue to accrue 
also during the deferral period  the company generally may not pay cash dividends on or repurchase its common stock or preferred stock  including the series b preferred stock 
in february   the company did not pay the required dividend to treasury for the sixth time and as a result  the treasury has the right to appoint two representatives to the company s board of directors 
the treasury has indicated that it intends to appoint two representatives and  until such appointments are made  treasury has sent an observer to the company s board of directors 
the terms of the series b preferred stock also prevent the company from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing its common stock while series b preferred stock dividends are in arrears 
the holders of our debt have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders 
we currently have a million credit facility with a correspondent lender  which includes million of subordinated debt and  in term debt 
as of december   the entire million of principal was outstanding 
the term debt and subordinated debt matures on march  the senior debt is secured by all of the capital stock of the bank 
at december   the company continued to be out of compliance with two of the financial covenants contained within the credit agreement  which constitutes an event of default 
in addition  as of december   we also had million in junior subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us to the extent the trusts have funds available for such obligations 

table of contents the rights of the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures are senior to the shares of our common stock and senior preferred stock 
as a result  we must make payments on our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock or preferred stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our stockholders 
the holders of our senior preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders 
in january  we issued and sold  shares of our series b preferred stock  which ranks senior to our common stock in the payment of dividends and on liquidation  to the treasury together with the warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock for million 
in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution  or liquidation  the holders of the series b preferred stock will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock but after the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures 
our loan portfolio is concentrated heavily in residential and commercial real estate loans  including construction loans  which involve risks specific to real estate values and the real estate and mortgage markets in general  all of which have been experiencing significant weakness 
our loan portfolio generally reflects the profile of the communities in which we operate 
because we are located in areas that have seen rapid growth over the past decade  real estate lending including commercial  construction and residential is a significant portion of our loan portfolio  with these three categories constituting billion  or approximately of our total loan portfolio  as of december  specifically  as of december   commercial real estate loans comprised approximately of our total loan portfolio  real estate construction loans comprised approximately and residential real estate loans comprised approximately 
given that the primary if not only source of collateral on these loans is real estate  additional adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market area could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio 
additionally  if the loans are not repaid according to their terms  we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan 
the effects of ongoing real estate challenges  combined with the ongoing correction in commercial and residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales  have adversely affected our real estate loan portfolio and have the potential to further adversely affect such portfolio in several ways  each of which could further adversely affect our operating results and or financial condition 
first  as noted above  approximately of our loan portfolio consists of real estate construction loans  which primarily are loans made to home builders and developers 
a continuation of the significantly lower demand for properties constructed by home builders and developers could result in additional delinquencies and charge offs in future periods on loans made to such borrowers 
second  the current market environment has caused  and continues to cause  a significantly lower demand for residential real estate loans  which constitute a significant part of our overall portfolio 
this continued lack of demand in residential real estate lending may require us to devote a larger portion of our total assets to lower yielding investment securities  which could adversely affect our net interest margin 
the trading price of our common stock is volatile  has declined substantially over the past three years and may decline in the future 
the securities markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years 
the trading price and volume of our common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations 
in addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section  the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by 
table of contents our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and prospects  particularly if they vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community  changes in the overall sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider comparable to us  changes in our industry and competitors  announcements of strategic developments  and other material events by us or our competitors  any future issuances of our common stock  which may be necessary to raise additional capital  and changes in global financial markets and economies and general market conditions  such as interest rates  commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets 
in addition  the nasdaq stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on nasdaq 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
to the extent that the price of our common stock remains low or declines further  our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise will be reduced and our stockholders may experience a significant loss in their investment in our common stock 
current and future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
we may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business  such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees 
claims may also be asserted by or on behalf of a variety of other parties  including government agencies or our stockholders  particularly in light of the substantial decline in the price of our common stock since for example  on february   a stockholder class action complaint was filed against us by a former employee alleging that there were breaches of fiduciary duties and disclosure requirements under the employee retirement income security act of with respect to our employees k savings plan and trust 
the class action complaint was amended on june   to add a second lead plaintiff  also a former employee 
the complaint  as amended  seeks equitable and as of yet unquantified monetary relief 
the parties have agreed to enter mediation and on january  bank counsel proposed three mediators to plaintiffs counsel 
the parties are currently scheduling the mediation 
it is possible that additional lawsuits will be filed based on the decline in the trading price of our stock naming the company  and its directors and officers  as defendants 
for additional information regarding this litigation  see part i  item of this form k 
any litigation involving us may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  which may seriously harm our business  overall financial condition  and operating results 
insurance may not cover existing or future claims  be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims  or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs  thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance  possibly resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock 
if we do not effectively manage our credit risks  we may experience increased levels of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies  which could require further increases in our provision for loan losses 
there are risks inherent in making any loan  including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers  risks of nonpayment  risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash 
table of contents flows available to service debt and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions 
we attempt to mitigate our credit risk through prudent loan application approval procedures  careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by our credit review department 
however  we cannot assure you that such approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these credit risks  and they cannot be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks 
should the economic climate fail to meaningfully improve  borrowers may experience difficulty repaying their obligations to the bank  and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require increases in the provision for loan losses  which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio 
we establish our allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level considered adequate by management to absorb loan losses that are inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  are determined based on a variety of factors  including an analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience and an evaluation of current economic conditions in our market areas 
the actual amount of loan losses is affected by changes in economic  operating and other conditions within our markets  which may be beyond our control  and such losses may exceed current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was approximately 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans that may become uncollectible  in light of the current economic environment in the bank s market areas and the continued stress on real estate valuations  there is no guarantee that we will not be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses either due to management s decision to do so or requirements by the regulators  particularly if economic conditions worsen beyond what management currently expects 
additional provisions for the allowance for loan losses and actual loan losses may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
commercial loans make up a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
commercial loans were million  or approximately of our total loan portfolio  as of december  our commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
most often  this collateral consists of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and real estate 
credit support is provided by the borrower for most of these loans  and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee  if any exists 
as a result  in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
the collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
real estate construction  land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project 
these estimates may be inaccurate  and we may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects 
construction  land acquisition  and development loans comprised approximately of our total loan portfolio at december   and such lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion  and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs 
table of contents and the realizable market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result  construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline  we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project 
if we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of  and accrued interest on  the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while we attempt to dispose of it 
if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price  we risk being delisted from trading on the nasdaq global select market 
any such delisting could limit investors ability to effect transactions in our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital in the future 
our common stock has declined significantly in recent years  particularly since early the last reported closing sale price of our shares on march  was per share 
under nasdaq s continued listing standards  if the closing bid price of our common stock is under per share for consecutive trading days  nasdaq may notify us that it intends to delist our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
if the closing bid price of our common stock falls below the minimum for consecutive days  nasdaq may delist our common stock from trading on certain of its markets 
if our stock were delisted  the ability of our stockholders to sell any of their shares of our common stock could be severely  if not completely  limited  causing our stock price to continue to decline 
additionally  if our common stock is not listed on an exchange  such as nasdaq  our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of common stock could be significantly hampered 
our future success is dependent on having an effective management team  which may be impacted by our profitability  the trading price of our common stock  our current regulatory status and our participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
our ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect our earnings and our ability to return to profitability 
it is critical to be able to retain and attract qualified additional management and loan officers with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas and the industry to implement our community based operating strategy and to return the company to profitability 
as a result of the bank having entered into the occ consent order  we are subject to certain other limitations regarding compensation and bonus payments to employees 
additionally  certain regulations  including the american recovery and reinvestment act of that was signed into law in february  include extensive new restrictions on our ability to pay retention awards  bonuses and other incentive compensation during the period in which the treasury holds any of our securities that were issued under the tarp capital purchase program 
many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and could cover other employees whose contributions to our performance are significant 
the limitations  in addition to the current low trading price of our common stock and our lack of profitability over the past several years  may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain these key employees in addition to our senior executive officers  especially if we are competing for talent against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions 
an unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
difficult market conditions have affected us and the financial industry and may continue to adversely affect us in the future 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past few years  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and commercial real estate loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
table of contents across the united states 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and historically elevated unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by many financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
these conditions have led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reductions in general business activity 
financial institutions have also generally experienced decreased borrowings 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and has adversely affected our industry and may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors 
the models we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how such economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates  which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the models 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties on favorable terms  or at all  could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry especially as a result of increased rule making called for by the dodd frank act  and compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
customer demand for loans secured by real estate could continue to be weak or even be reduced due to the continuing economic conditions and a lack of meaningful improvement 
we expect to face increased capital requirements  both at the company and the bank 
in this regard  the collins amendment to the dodd frank act requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements that will apply to both insured banks and their holding companies 
if levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is concentrated in and dependent upon the welfare of several counties in illinois and the state of illinois 
our primary market area is aurora  illinois  and its surrounding communities as well as southwestern cook county 
the city of aurora is located in northeastern illinois  approximately miles west of chicago 
the bank operates primarily in kane  kendall  dekalb  dupage  lasalle  will and cook counties in illinois  and  as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes and 
table of contents fluctuations in the economic conditions in those areas 
we have developed a strong presence in the counties we serve  with particular concentration in aurora  illinois  and surrounding communities 
the bank offers banking services for retail  commercial  industrial  and public entity customers in the aurora  north aurora  batavia  st 
charles  burlington  elburn  elgin  maple park  kaneville  sugar grove  lisle  joliet  yorkville  plano  wasco  dekalb  ottawa  oswego  sycamore  new lenox  frankfort  and chicago heights communities and surrounding areas 
the bank also offers complete trust investment management and other fiduciary services and  through a registered broker dealer  provides stocks  bonds  securities  annuities  and non fdic insured mutual funds 
the communities that we serve grew rapidly over the past decade and we intend to continue concentrating our business efforts in these communities 
our future success is largely dependent upon the overall economic health of these communities 
however  since late  the united states economy has generally experienced difficult economic conditions 
weak economic conditions are characterized by  among other indicators  deflation  unemployment  fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets  increased delinquencies on mortgage  commercial and consumer loans  residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity 
all of those factors are generally detrimental to our business 
if the overall economic conditions fail to significantly improve or decline further  particularly within our primary market areas  we could experience a lack of demand for our products and services  an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults and high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures 
moreover  because of our geographic concentration  we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets 
similarly  we have credit exposure to entities or in industries that could be impacted by the continued financial difficulties at the state level 
exposure to health care  construction and social services organizations has been reviewed to evaluate credit impact from a possible reorganization of state finances 
credit downgrades  partial charge offs and specific reserves could develop in this exposure with resulting impact on our financial condition if the state of illinois encounters more severe payment issuance capabilities 
legislative and regulatory reforms applicable to the financial services industry may  if enacted or adopted  have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law  which requires significant changes to the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act  together with the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder  included provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that will affect how community banks  thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future 
ultimately  the dodd frank act will  among other things  impose new capital requirements on bank holding companies  change the base for fdic insurance assessments to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than upon its deposit base  and permanently raise the standard deposit insurance limit to  and expand the fdic s authority to raise insurance premiums 
the legislation also calls for the fdic to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from to for deposit insurance purposes by september  and to offset the effect of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than billion 
the dodd frank act also authorized the federal reserve to limit interchange fees payable on debit card transactions  established the bureau of consumer financial protection as an independent entity within the federal reserve  with broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards  and contained provisions on mortgage related matters  such as steering incentives  determinations as to a borrower s ability to repay and prepayment penalties 
the dodd frank act also includes provisions that have affected  and may further affect in the future  corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly traded companies 

table of contents the collins amendment to the dodd frank act  among other things  eliminates certain trust preferred securities from tier capital  but certain trust preferred securities issued prior to may  by bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or less will continue to be included in tier capital 
this provision also requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements that will apply to both insured banks and their holding companies 
regulations implementing the collins amendment have not yet been issued 
these provisions  or any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry  if enacted or adopted  may change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes may impact the profitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices  including the ability to offer new products  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans  and achieve satisfactory interest spreads  and could expose us to additional costs  including increased compliance costs 
these changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our management continues to stay abreast of developments with respect to the dodd frank act  many provisions of which will continue to be phased in over the next several months and years  and continues to assess its impact on our operations 
however  the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the financial services industry in general  and us in particular  is uncertain at this time 
monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon our business  financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted 
interest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
shifts in short term interest rates may reduce net interest income  which is the principal component of our earnings 
we have measurement processes in place to help us manage this potential variability in our net interest income 
those measurements indicate that we will realize an expansion in net interest income if interest rates rise  primarily because rates on assets will increase faster than rates on deposits 
the relationship between short term and long term rates  often called the yield curve shape  can also impact net interest income 
generally  when the difference between short term and long term rates is small a flatter yield curve  net interest income will be reduced 
net interest income will tend to increase when the difference between short term and long term rates increases ie a steeper yield curve 
interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers  which consequently increases the potential for default 
at the same time  the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates 
in a low or declining interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on the loans underlying our participation interests as borrowers refinance their mortgages at lower rates 
changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans  securities and other assets 
an increase in 
table of contents interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
thus  an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets would have an adverse impact on net interest income 
if short term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period  and assuming long term interest rates fall further  we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem 
this may have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain limitations and restrictions  and there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue paying the same level of dividends in the future that we paid prior to or that we will be able to pay future dividends at all 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to the bank  including the requirement under the national bank act that it may not pay dividends in any calendar year that  in the aggregate  exceed its year to date net income plus its retained net income for the two preceding years 
currently  the bank is unable to pay dividends to the company without the occ s prior approval and a statement of no objection from the federal reserve 
in light of the current financial condition of the bank  we do not believe the occ will grant broad dividend approval in the near future 
in addition  as a bank holding company  our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the federal reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends 
the federal reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other tier capital instruments ie  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt in light of our earnings  capital adequacy and financial condition 
as a general matter  the federal reserve indicates that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate  defer or significantly reduce the dividends if the company s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or the company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
in light of these guidelines  we stopped paying dividends on our common stock in the third quarter of finally  as described in a separate risk factor  we will not be able to pay dividends on our common stock until all deferred interest on our junior subordinated debentures and accrued and unpaid dividends on our series b preferred stock have been paid in full 

table of contents the company and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities  and tax laws or interpretations of existing laws may change 
in the normal course of business  the company and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments made and the businesses in which it has engaged 
federal and state taxing authorities have recently become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions  including positions that have been taken by the company 
these tax positions may relate to tax compliance  sales and use  franchise  gross receipts  payroll  property  or income tax issues  including tax base  apportionment  and tax credit planning 
the challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
if any such challenges are not resolved in the company s favor  they could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in federal and state tax laws or interpretations  including changes affecting tax rates  income not subject to tax under existing laws or interpretations  income sourcing  or consolidation and combination rules may also have an adverse impact upon the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings 
current accounting and tax rules  standards  policies and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
a change in accounting standards may adversely affect reported financial condition and results of operations 
downgrades in the credit rating of one or more insurers that provide credit enhancement for our state and municipal securities portfolio may have an adverse impact on the market for and valuation of these types of securities 
we invest in tax exempt state and local municipal securities  some of which are insured by monoline insurers  which  since the economic crisis unfolded in  have come under scrutiny by rating agencies 
even though management generally purchases municipal securities on the overall credit strength of the issuer  the reduction in the credit rating of an insurer may negatively impact the market for and valuation of our investment securities 
this downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity and capital 
we face intense competition in all phases of our business from other banks and financial institutions 
the banking and financial services business in our market is highly competitive 
our competitors include large regional banks  local community banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market mutual funds  credit unions  farm credit services and other nonbank financial service providers 
many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services 
increased competition in our market may also result in a decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits  reduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates or loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable 
if increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits  our net interest income could be adversely impacted 
if increased competition causes us to relax our underwriting standards  we could be exposed to higher losses from lending activities 
additionally  many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to capital markets  possess larger lending limits and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer 

table of contents we have a continuing need for technological change and we may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market area 
many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
as a result  they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to offer  which would put us at a competitive disadvantage 
accordingly  we cannot provide you with assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers 
system failure or breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as to litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data 
a failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors 
employee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information 
it is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence 
we maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks  including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence  or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the company paid dividends as set forth in the table above 
the company s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore

the company provides a wide range of financial services through its twenty seven banking locations located in cook  kane  kendall  dekalb  dupage  lasalle and will counties in illinois 
these banking centers offer access to a full menu of traditional retail and commercial banking services including treasury management operations as well as corporate and personal trust services 
the company focuses its business upon establishing and maintaining relationships with its clients while maintaining a commitment to providing for the financial services needs of the communities in which it operates through its retail branch network 
emphasis is placed upon relationships with individual customers as well as small to medium sized companies throughout our market area 
the markets served by the company make available a mix of commercial and industrial  real estate  and consumer related lending opportunities  as well as providing a stable core deposit base 
the company also has expansive wealth management services  which now includes a registered investment advisory platform in addition to trust administration and trust services related to personal and corporate trusts  including employee benefit plan administration services 
in  the financial system in the united states  including the credit markets and markets for real estate and related assets  continued to struggle toward economic recovery from the unparalleled economic problems that began in early although the precipitous rate of valuation decline in certain real estate assets appeared to have slowed generally in the latter part of  the financial system disruption continued to result in declines in the values of real estate and associated asset types during the reporting period that ended december   particularly in the company s market area 
the availability of ready local markets remained limited and continued to affect the ability of many borrowers to pay on their obligations 
the company s pre tax losses for december  and were million and million  respectively 
despite incurring an operating loss in  the company recorded income tax expense totaling million as it established a valuation reserve on substantially all of its deferred tax assets at december  management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not as required by accounting principles and established a valuation allowance to reflect this judgment 
considerations in making 
table of contents this tax valuation estimate included forecasts of future income  available tax planning strategies  and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
in each future accounting period  the company s management has reevaluated current conditions to consider support for a change in the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
any such subsequent reduction in the estimated valuation allowance would lower the amount of income tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
a discussion related to realizability of tax benefits and related items is included in our results of operations that follows as well as in notes and of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in  the bank continued to reposition the balance sheet to attempt to reduce risk  maintain its capital ratios  and liquidity and improve asset quality 
where permissible  the company deferred dividends and distributions related to its capital instruments and continued to take steps to cut operating expenses 
the deferral of interest payments and dividends related to capital instruments are discussed in notes and to the financial statements in this report 
management has emphasized continuing its open dialogue with customers  employees  stakeholders and regulators 
a discussion of regulatory matters including the compliance of the bank with the occ consent order is detailed in the supervisory and regulation section of item at this form k and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the bank continued to work to address key asset quality and liquidity issues throughout at the same time  the bank expanded upon core competencies by broadening the platform of services offered in the wealth management unit with the addition of investment advisory management services and continued with a high level of profit contribution from the mortgage origination unit despite difficulties in the larger economy and underlying real estate markets 
management continued with its ongoing actions to identify and address problem credits throughout  but borrowers in the construction and development c d sector in the company s markets still faced significant challenges operating within the constraints of the economic environment 
as a result  portions of the loan portfolio such as the homebuilder segment remained particularly vulnerable to economic stress 
on a cumulative cycle basis  the construction portfolio has accounted for of all charge offs since the beginning of  and the homebuilder portion has accounted for of that amount 
management believes the adverse impact from the construction portfolio is diminishing as the percentage of the company s loan portfolio in construction loans was much smaller at year end as compared to any other point in the prior two years 
total construction loans were reduced to of the total loan portfolio at december   as compared to at december  as of december   homebuilder credits decreased to only of the total loan portfolio and total construction charge offs were million in  down  or million  from million in the ability of commercial real estate nonfarm cre borrowers to repay their obligations was also closely tied to economic conditions in the company s market area 
some borrowers with owner occupied properties posted decreases in their operating results in leading to increased problems with many of these loans 
in addition  increased vacancy rates in the non owner occupied categories continued to put downward pressure on investor lease rates in some areas 
while the impact from the recession on cre lagged the construction and housing sectors  the continued economic pressures contributed to defaults that resulted in charge offs totaling million in  a decrease of million  from million a year ago 
the company s primary deposit products are checking  now  money market  savings  and certificate of deposit accounts  and the company s primary lending products are commercial mortgages  construction lending  commercial and industrial loans  residential mortgages and installment loans 
major portions of the company s loans are secured by various forms of collateral including real estate  business assets  and consumer property while borrower cash flow is the primary source of repayment at the time of loan origination 
for  the company recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  which compares with net loss of million or diluted loss per share in the basic loss per share was in and in the loss incurred in included the previously disclosed income tax expense of million

the net loss available to common stockholders was million and million for the years ended december  and december  net interest and dividend income decreased million  or  from million for the year ended to million for the year ended average earning assets decreased million  or  from billion in to billion in average earning assets decreased during  as management continued to focus on asset quality and capital management and took steps to shrink the balance sheet and preserve capital 
average loans  including loans held for sale during the year  decreased million  in part  from a continued low level of qualified borrower demand within the company s market areas  combined with charge off activity 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased million  or  from billion in to billion in as the need for funding decreased with the reduction in assets 
net interest income decreased with the balance sheet deleveraging and the net interest margin tax equivalent basis  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  similarly decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  details on the changes in specific earning asset categories as well as the liability funding sources are discussed in detail in the net interest income section that follows the application of critical accounting policies 
the average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from in to  or basis points  in similarly  the cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities decreased from in  to  or basis points in application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies are presented in note of the financial statements included in this annual report 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management has determined that the company s accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses is an accounting area requiring subjective or complex judgments very important to the company s financial position and results of operations 
therefore  the allowance policy is one of the company s most critical accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans are based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions  as well as estimated collateral valuations  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for credit losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the allowance balance required using an assessment of various risk factors including  but not limited to  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  volume trends in delinquencies  nonaccruals  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all contractual principal or interest due will be received according to the original terms of the loan agreement 
management defines the measured value of an impaired 
table of contents loan based upon the present value of the future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  or the fair value of underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
in addition  a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision for loan losses section that follows 
the company recognizes expense for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as deferred federal and state taxes  estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
the company maintained net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences  the largest of which related to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes as it relates to lending activities  only net charge offs are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in either the carryforward or carryback periods to cover net operating losses generated by the reversal of temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided by way of a charge to income tax expense if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
that determination is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
management considered both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence  if any  of taxes paid in available carry back years and the likelihood that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence included a cumulative loss and negative general business and economic trends 
management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not as required by accounting principles and established a valuation allowance to reflect this judgment 
management believed internal projections and positive evidence was not sufficient under generally accepted accounting principles to overcome the negative evidence present at december in both and this was based  in part  upon the lack of certainty of future projections to support the deferred tax assets from an accounting standpoint and based upon that guidance a valuation reserve was needed 
this determination was based  largely  on the negative evidence of a cumulative loss caused primarily by the loan loss provisions made during the last four years 
in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions increased the likelihood of volatility in future earnings 
accrual of income taxes payable and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are estimates subject to change based upon the outcome of future events 
future issuances or sales of common stock or other equity securities could also result in an ownership change as defined for us federal income tax purposes 
if an ownership change were to occur  the company could realize a loss of a portion of our us federal and state deferred tax assets  including certain built in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes  as a result of the operation of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the amount of the permanent loss would be determined by the annual limitation period and the carryforward period generally up to years for federal net operating losses and any resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition 
income tax returns are also subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs and state taxing authorities 
income tax expense for current and prior periods is subject to adjustment based upon the outcome of such audits 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for all probable income taxes payable 
starting january   the company was under examination with the irs for the company s federal income tax filing for the year and by the state of illinois for the tax years and years that remain subject to examination include year for federal and years and for illinois 
another of the company s critical accounting policies relates to the fair value measurement of various nonfinancial and financial instruments including investment securities  valuation of other real estate owned  derivative instruments and the expanded fair value measurement disclosures that are related to accounting standards codification asc in detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as such  net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and yields on earning assets and the volume and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is the ratio of tax equivalent net interest income to average earning assets 
as discussed in the overview section above  management of capital and existing asset quality was emphasized over generating loan growth throughout and management intends to make future reductions to portfolio concentrations in real estate 
the decrease in net interest income during this period was primarily the result of decreased lending activity combined with some reductions in securities available for sale with new securities purchased at lower market yields 
the general decrease in market rates  combined with lower deposit volumes  also lowered interest expense in the same period 
the change in capital  asset deployment  and funding sources decreased the net interest margin 
the net interest margin tax equivalent basis  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets decreased to from as compared to the average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points from in  to in however  the cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities also decreased basis points from  to in the same period 
net interest and dividend income was million in and million in average earning assets decreased million  or  from billion in to billion in management remained focused upon asset quality during and as a result took additional steps to contract the balance sheet to manage and preserve capital 
because of that focus  a continued low level of qualified borrower demand  other real estate owned oreo and charge off activity  average loans and loans held for sale during the year decreased million 
management continued to reduce securities available for sale in the first half of  with a strong emphasis upon reducing tax exempt bond holdings 
securities volumes grew in the second half of in light of strong company liquidity 
balance sheet deleveraging in also included significant reductions in both borrowings and deposits that previously provided funding for loan growth and securities 
consistent with prior years  management maintained an emphasis upon relationship banking throughout versus attracting or retaining customers with a single transaction focus  typically associated with a higher cost of funding 
as a result  there was a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities of million  or  in average interest bearing liabilities were billion in the net interest margin tax equivalent basis  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased from in to in the average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from in to  or basis points  in at the same time  however  the cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities decreased from to  or basis points 
the decrease in the level of average earning assets in  principally loans  contributed to decreased interest income as did the higher level of nonaccrual loans and average oreo as collateral from loans was converted to this nonearning asset category 
at the same time  the general decrease in interest rates  particularly rates on time certificate of deposits  provided an offsetting effect of the continued balance sheet deleverage strategy 
as described above  the company s net interest income can be significantly influenced by a variety of factors  including overall economic conditions  credit risk  the amount of nonearning assets including nonperforming loans and oreo  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice  variances in prepayment of loans and securities  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  and balance sheet growth or contraction 
the company s asset and liability committee alco seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring the company s balance sheet and off balance sheet positions  and this process is discussed in more detail in the interest rate risk section

these same factors affected the ability of certain cre borrowers to repay their obligations 
during  some borrowers with owner occupied properties experienced decreases in their operating results  which led to increased problems with many of those loans 
in addition  increased vacancy rates in the non owner occupied categories continued to put downward pressure on investor lease rates in some areas 
while the impact from the recession on cre lagged the construction and housing sectors  the continued economic pressures contributed to defaults that resulted in charge offs totaling million in there was a significant reduction in new loans migrating to special mention loan status and a decrease in loans thirty to eighty nine days past due on a linked quarter comparative basis at december  special mention loan status credits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in special mention loans as of december  is primarily reflective of upgrades from substandard to special mention status 
loans past due thirty to eighty nine days totaled million  and million  respectively in the same periods 
while the reserves that have been established at december  indicate

this class accounted for of all cre loans and of all nonperforming cre loans at december  fourth quarter charge offs in the retail segment totaled million and management estimated the remaining specific allocation for nonperforming loans of million was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  however  there can be no guarantee that actual losses in this category  and all other categories discussed in this section  will not exceed current management estimates

with million of these loans nonperforming at december   these loans accounted for of total nonperforming cre 
special purpose owner occupied credits include loans collateralized by property types such as gas stations  health and fitness centers  golf courses  restaurants  and medical office buildings

charge offs totaled  in the fourth quarter of  and management estimated that specific allocations of million were sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  non owner occupied special purpose loans represented of the cre portfolio  and of nonperforming cre loans at the end of the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter  a charge off of  was recorded  and management estimated that a specific allocation of  was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  in addition to the specific allocations detailed above  management estimates include a higher risk commercial real estate pool loss factor for certain cre loans 
these loans typically have a deficiency in cash flow coverage from the property securing the credit  but other supporting factors such as liquidity  guarantor capacity  sufficient global cash flow coverage or cooperation from the borrower is evident to support the credit 
these deficiencies in cash flow coverage are typically attributable to vacancy that is expected to be temporary or reduced operating income from the owner occupant due to cyclical impacts from the recession 
the pool also includes cases where the property securing the credit has adequate cash flow coverage  but the borrower has other economic stress indicators to warrant heightened risk treatment 
management estimated a reduction of reserves of million in the fourth quarter of  based primarily upon the amount of loans within this pool at december  the combination of increased specific loan loss allocations and decreased general and pool allocation from the high risk pool resulted in a reduction of million of estimated loss coverage in the fourth quarter of construction and development c d at december   nonperforming c d loans totaled million  or of total nonperforming loans 
this is a decrease of million from million at september   and a decrease of million from million at december  of the million of total c d loans in the portfolio  of all construction loans were nonperforming as of december   as compared to at september   and at december  total c d charge offs for the fourth quarter of were million  as compared to million in the fourth quarter following that charge off activity  management estimated that specific allocations of million were sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure in this segment at december  the majority of the bank s c d loans are located in suburban chicago markets  predominantly in the far western and southwestern suburbs 
management closely monitors the performing loans that have been rated as special mention or substandard but accruing 
while some additional adverse migration is still possible  management believes that the remaining performing c d borrowers have demonstrated sufficient operating strength through an extended period of weak construction to avoid classification as an impaired credit at december  as a result  management believes future losses in the construction segment will continue to trend downward 
in addition to reviewing the operating performance of the borrowers when reviewing allowance estimates  management also continues to update underlying collateral valuation estimates to reflect the aggregate estimated credit exposure 

table of contents residential real estate nonperforming family owner occupied residential mortgages to consumers totaled million  or of the nonperforming loan total as of december  this segment totaled million in nonperforming loans at september   compared to million at december  while kendall  kane and will counties experienced high rates of foreclosure in both and  the bank has recently experienced relatively stable or somewhat improved nonperforming totals 
the majority of all residential mortgage loans originated today are sold on the secondary market 
of the nonperforming loans in this category  million  or  are to homeowners enrolled in the bank s foreclosure avoidance program and are classified as restructured at december  the typical concessions granted in these cases were small and temporary rate reductions and a reduced monthly payment with the expectation that these borrowers resume normal performance on their obligations when their earnings situation improves 
the usual profile of these borrowers includes a decrease in household income resulting from a change or loss of employment 
the remaining nonperforming loans in the family residential category are in nonaccrual status and most cases are in various stages of foreclosure 
the bank did not offer subprime mortgage products to its customers 
management believes that deterioration in the segment relates primarily to the high rate of unemployment in our market areas offset by some reductions from loans moved to oreo or upgraded as borrowers become once again employed 
in addition  a significant portion of these nonperforming loans were supported by private mortgage insurance  and  at december   management estimated that a specific allocation of  was adequate loss coverage following the  of charge offs that occurred during the quarter 
at december   there were no loans that were greater than days past due and were still accruing interest in this portfolio segment 
additionally  at december   loans to days past due and still accruing totaled million of which million was exactly days past due on december   which was an increase from million at september   but an improvement from million at december  nonperforming residential investor loans at december  consisted of multi family million and family properties million for a total of million  or of the nonperforming loans total 
this was an increase from million at september   and a decrease from million at december  following the fourth quarter charge off of million  management estimated that a total specific allocation of million would provide sufficient loss reserves at december   for the remaining risk in this category 
the multi family and rental market segment is showing improved credit metrics as higher occupancy rates have driven stronger net operating income 
other the remaining nonperforming credits included million in commercial loans  million in consumer home equity and second mortgage loans and million in farmland and agricultural loans 
these loan categories have shown stable credit characteristics and losses have been minimal during this economic cycle 
at december   management estimated that a total specific allocation of  on the commercial portfolio would be sufficient loss coverage for the remaining risk in those nonperforming credits  and that  was sufficient loss coverage for the consumer home equity and second mortgage loan segment 
these estimated amounts were following charge offs in the fourth quarter of of  in commercial and industrial loans  and  in consumer home equity loans 
other troubled loans loans that were classified as performing but to days past due and still accruing interest increased to million at december   from million at september   but decreased from million at december  at december   loans to days past due consisted of million in family owner occupied mortgages  million in commercial real estate credits  million in residential investor credits   million in construction and development   in commercial and industrial loans  and million in home equity loans

table of contents status total million  which was a decrease from million on a linked quarter basis and a decrease of million from december  accruing tdrs included million in family owner occupied mortgages in the foreclosure avoidance program discussed previously  million in restructured residential lot inventory loans to builders   in family investor mortgages  and million in non owner occupied commercial real estate 
nonaccrual tdr loans totaled million as of december  these credits  which have not demonstrated a sustained period of financial performance  are primarily due to bankruptcy or continued deterioration in the borrowers financial situation 
management is pursuing liquidation strategies for many of these loans 
management estimated the quarterly specific allocation on tdrs in nonaccrual status and believed that specific allocation estimates of million at december   were sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure in this category 
allowance for loan losses alll the bank s alll methodology reasonably estimates loan and lease losses as of the financial statement date s and incorporate management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process 
the methodology is done according to gaap including  but not limited to  guidance included in accounting standards codification asc and asc  formally known as fas and fas  respectively 
its analysis is prepared in accordance with guidelines established by generally accepted accounting principles  the sec  the ffiec  the aicpa audit  and accounting guide for banks and savings institutions  and banking industry practices overall 
this methodology is periodically reviewed by the bank s independent cpas and banking regulators 
the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was as of december   which was an increase from as of december  the increase in this ratio was largely driven by an million  or  reduction in nonperforming loans 
management updates real estate appraisals on its criticized assets at least annually  and also discounts real estate valuations based on market data and ambient trends in appraisal values 
accordingly  management updated the estimated specific allocations in the fourth quarter after receiving more recent appraisal collateral valuations or information on cash flow trends related to the impaired credits 
the estimated general allocations decreased by million from december   as the overall loan balances subject to general factors decreased at december  management determined the estimated amount to provide in the allowance for loan losses based upon a number of factors  including loan growth or contraction  the quality and composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience 
the latter item was also weighted more heavily based upon recent loss experience 
the c d portfolio has had diminished adverse migration and the remaining credits are exhibiting more stable credit characteristics 
management estimates adequate coverage for the remaining risk of loss in the construction portfolio 
the estimated general allocations decreased by million over the course of from million at december  to million at december  as the overall loan balances subject to general factors decreased 
management determined the estimated amount to provide in the allowance for loan losses based upon a number of factors  including loan growth or contraction  the quality and composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience management regularly reviews the performance of the higher risk pool within commercial real estate loans  and adjusts the population and the related loss factors taking into account adverse market trends including collateral valuation as well as its assessments of the credits in that pool 
those assessments capture management s estimate of the potential for adverse migration to an impaired status as well as its estimation of what the potential valuation impact from that migration would be if it were to occur 
the quantity of assets subject to this pool factor decreased by in the fourth quarter as compared to september  also  compared to september  management decreased the loss factor assigned to this pool by based on risk characteristics of the remaining credits 
management has also observed that many stresses in those credits were generally attributable to cyclical economic events that were showing some signs of stabilization 

table of contents those signs included a reduction in loan migration to watch status  as well as a decrease in to day past due loans and some stabilization in values of certain properties 
management conducts a full annual review of all home equity lines of credit heloc by looking at credit scores and collateral values 
when we are notified of a foreclosure on a first mortgage 
our heloc loan is moved to nonaccrual and a decision is made if the loan is collectible 
we actively charge off loan balances in the absence of sufficient equity unless the borrower reaffirms or notifies us on an intention to reaffirm 
the above changes in estimates were made by management to be consistent with observable trends within loan portfolio segments and in conjunction with market conditions and credit review administration activities 
several environmental factors are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are included in the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
when measured as a percentage of loans outstanding  the total allowance for loan losses decreased from of total loans as of december   to of total loans at december  in management s judgment  an adequate allowance for estimated losses has been established  however  there can be no assurance that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts in the future 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three components i specific allocations established for losses resulting from an analysis developed through reviews of individual impaired loans for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loss experience for each loan category  and iii reserves based on general current economic conditions as well as specific economic and other factors believed to be relevant to the company s loan portfolio 
each component is discussed in greater detail below 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation performed pursuant to asc topic  contingencies  and asc topic  receivables including accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
specific allocations management reviews on at least a quarterly basis certain loans on nonaccrual  loans over days past due  troubled debt restructurings or any loans considered doubtful or loss 
the bank s loan workout specialists analyze these loans with the results reported to the loan review committee on a credit management report 
from that report  management considers the amount of specific allocations by reviewing  on a credit by credit basis  all loans considered impaired under asc topic receivables as well as all problem and watch loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor may be unable to collect all contractual principal or interest due according to the original terms of the agreement 
a problem loan is defined by the company s loan policy as a credit that is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged  if any 
loans so classified have a well defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard loans  does not have to exist in individual loans classified 
specific allocations are typically discussed at the quarterly watch problem oreo meeting 
at december   the committee consisted of the company s president  the bank s president and company chief operating officer  the bank s regional senior vice presidents  the company s executive vice president chief credit officer  the first vice president of loan review  the first vice president of special assets  and other senior lenders who serve as members of the loan committee 
at the end of each quarter  the committee reviews individual impaired loans and adjustment estimates are made to the general calculated reserve for each loan as deemed necessary 
specific adjustments are made depending on the estimated value of the collateral securing each loan and or on expected cash flows 
the company generally obtains a current external appraisal within twelve months on real estate secured impaired loans  but more frequent appraisal may be requested by the committee 
other valuation techniques are also used and include internal valuations  comparable property analyses  and contractual sales information 
for appraisals that are more than six months aged  where management has market knowledge that real estate values have declined  the credit committee may further discount appraisal values prior to obtaining a new appraisal within the twelve month timeframe 
appraisal 
table of contents discount estimates are based on the committee s evaluation of market conditions and are in addition to a reduction in value for potential sales costs and discounting that has been incorporated in the independent appraisal and or appraisal review process 
at december   the company had a total of million in nonaccrual loans  of which nonaccrual loans totaling million had a specific allocation of million 
the company had million of tdr s still accruing  of which tdrs still accruing totaling million had a specific allocation of  as of december   the company had a total of million in nonaccrual loans  of which nonaccrual loans totaling million had a specific allocation of million 
at the same time  the company had million of tdr still accruing  of which tdr still accruing totaling million had a specific allocation of  impaired loans at december   and were million and million  respectively 
historical reserves and management allocations the component of the allowance for loan losses based on historical loan loss experience is determined using historical charge off data for the last five years  with more weight placed on the most recent two years 
this calculation is done monthly and refined quarterly 
management considers a variety of factors to determine the appropriate level of allowance for inherent loan losses including  but not limited to  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  volume trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
all factors are considered on a quarterly basis and are adjusted when appropriate 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions and or charge offs to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
it is also the company s general practice to request that the bank s primary regulator provide an express determination letter to evidence the regulatory examination review of charge off determination and practice as it relates to the allowance for loan losses 
the general component of the allowance recognizes probable inherent  but undetected  losses in the loan portfolio 
regardless of how management analyzes customer performance  ratings migration  economic conditions and interest rate risk  management believes there are additional potential risks that are unaccounted for in the process of making loans 
this is due to several factors including  but not limited to timing delays in receiving information regarding a customer s financial condition  changes in individual business climates  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations and collateral assessments  and the open interpretation of economic trends 
the analysis of these factors involves a high degree of judgment by management 
because of the imprecision surrounding these factors  the company estimates a range of inherent losses and maintains a general allowance that is not allocated to a specific category 
changes in the allowance for loan losses are detailed in note on the consolidated financial statements of this report 
noninterest income noninterest income decreased in the year ending december   by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year the decrease is partly attributable to a nonrecurring litigation related income item for million as a result of the previously disclosed illinois supreme court opinion and another non recurring boli death benefit item for  in trust income decreased by  in and was essentially the same as the million recorded in the decrease in annual revenue was primarily due to a reduction in estate settlement activity and personal trust fees 
discretionary assets under management were million and million at december  
table of contents and substantially all of the decrease in discretionary assets in the trust department was attributable to the number of closed accounts and customers transfer of assets to other financial advisors 
service charge income from deposit accounts totaled million in  a decrease of  or  from primarily due to decreases in overdraft fees  which have declined industry wide in keeping with recent regulatory changes 
that trend was offset somewhat by an increase in commercial checking fees of  or  in as compared to levels 
the downward pressure on interest rates during and continued to reduce commercial earnings credits and increased net fee income in this category in both of those years 
total mortgage banking income including net gain on sales of mortgage loans  secondary market fees  and servicing income  was million in  which was a decrease of million  or  from levels reflecting decreases in sales of loans to investors 
loans sold  including gains on sale totaled million in  and million in net realized gains on securities totaled  in as compared to million for the year ended december  bank owned life insurance boli cash surrender value net income decreased  or  to million  as the underlying investment performance was stronger in than interchange income from debit card usage continued to increase in as customers continued to respond favorably to rewards programs and consumer card activity remained strong  although recently announced and pending legislative changes may adversely affect this revenue source in the future 
interchange income from debit card usage was million and million in and  respectively 
the lease revenue received from oreo properties increased million in the year ended december   to million as compared to million in the prior year  as the number of properties that generated rental income increased 
the bank had a total net gain on sale of oreo properties of million for the year  which was a  increase from the net gains resulted from management s successful efforts to dispose of oreo and focus upon the reduction of nonperforming assets 
other noninterest income was million in as compared to million in even though automatic teller machine surcharge and interchange fees increased  decreases in fee income from brokerage activities and interest rate swaps in more than outpaced that growth 
noninterest expense noninterest expense was million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the same period in salaries and benefits expense was million during the year ended december   which was a million decrease from the prior year 
this category totaled million during the twelve months ended december  the reduction in salaries and benefits expense resulted primarily from a decrease in salary expense coupled with reductions in group medical expenses although management selectively reduced positions in and the number of full time equivalent employees decreased to for the fourth quarter of as compared to at the same time last year 
net occupancy expense of million decreased of  or during remained consistent with the million recorded in furniture and fixture expenses decreased by  to million in the year ended december  fdic costs decreased  or  for the year ended december   respectively  as compared to the same period of the prior year 
in october  the board of directors of the fdic voted to propose a comprehensive  long range plan for deposit insurance fund management in response to changes to the fdic s authority to manage the deposit insurance fund contained in the dodd frank act 
as part of the fund management plan  fdic adopted a new restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches the required percent by september  the new methodology for the assessment calculation became 
table of contents effective with the second quarter of general bank insurance increased million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  reflecting increased premiums upon renewal 
advertising expense decreased by  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the same periods in  primarily due to decreased direct mail and radio advertising costs 
legal fees increased  or in a year to date comparison and were primarily related to increased volume of loan workouts 
oreo expense decreased million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease for the year to date period was primarily due to decreases in valuation expense of million as property values generally began to stabilize or decline more slowly 
this decrease was partially offset by increased expenses incurred in oreo property taxes and insurance of million for the year ended december   due to the net increase in the number of properties held in other expenses were million in the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from million in other expense decreases resulted primarily from the reduction of consulting and management fees  correspondent bank fees and postage costs 
income taxes the company had income tax expense of million for the year ended december   despite a million pre tax loss during that period  due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  income tax benefits and the related tax assets are only allowed to be recognized if they will more likely than not be fully realized 
as a result  as of december   the net amount of the company s deferred tax assets related to operations has been reduced to zero 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including forecasts of future income  available tax planning strategies  and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
management considered both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets  which is largely dependent upon the ability to derive benefits based upon future taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of  the continued adverse economic environment contributed to further asset quality deterioration 
this resulted in an increased operating loss from the third quarter and contributed to uncertainty regarding the projections of future taxable income  which called into question the company s ability to fully realize the deferred tax asset 
management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not as required by accounting principles and established a valuation allowance to reflect this judgment 
management believed internal projections and positive evidence was not deemed sufficient under generally accepted accounting principles to overcome the negative evidence present at december  as a result  the company recorded a valuation allowance totaling million against its deferred tax assets of million at december  resulting in total income tax expense for the year ended december  of million 
a deferred tax asset of million related to accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities remains at december  an increase in rates will generally cause a decrease in the fair value of individual securities and results in changes in unrealized loss on available for sale securities while a decrease in rates generally causes an increase in fair value at a point in time 
in addition to the impact of rate changes upon pricing  uncertainty in the financial markets can cause reduced liquidity for certain investments and those changes are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has both the ability and intent to retain an investment in available for sale securities 
the company s primary deferred tax assets related to its allowance for loan losses 
in each future accounting period  the company s management will reevaluate whether the current conditions in conjunction with positive and negative evidence support a change in the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
any such subsequent reduction in the estimated valuation allowance would lower the amount of income tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 

table of contents financial condition general total assets decreased million  or  from december   to close at billion as of december  loans decreased by million  or to billion  as management continued to emphasize balance sheet stabilization and credit quality as demand from qualified borrowers remained slow in the bank s primary market areas 
at the same time  loan charge off activity reduced balances and collateral that previously secured loans moved to oreo 
as a result  the oreo assets increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to december  the largest changes by loan type included decreases in commercial real estate  real estate construction  residential real estate loans and commercial loans of million  million  million and million  or   and  respectively 
management intends to continue to reduce portfolio concentrations in all real estate categories throughout available for sale securities increased by million  or  for the year ended december   reflecting a movement by management to emphasize securities investments in the absence of qualified loan demand 
management continued to increase available for sale securities in the fourth quarter utilizing liquid funds 
for the year ended december   large dollar purchases were made in us government agency mortgage backed securities  us government agencies  corporate bonds  collateralized mortgage backed securities and asset backed student loan securities totaling million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
purchases were made under the bank s established investment policy 
at the same time  net cash equivalents decreased as management reallocated resources to higher yielding available for sale securities in compliance with the bank s liquidity management programs and without degradation to the bank s liquidity position 
investments long term securities available for sale increased million during  from million as of december   to million as of december  management emphasized securities investments in the absence of qualified loan demand utilizing liquid funds

us government agency securities comprised of the portfolio as of december   and of the portfolio as of december   whereas the mortgage backed agency securities represented and of the investment portfolio as of the same dates 
as of december   the company held million in collateralized mortgage obligations versus million at december  at december   state and political subdivision securities totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million at december  that decrease in volume was primarily due to sales activities combined with maturities and calls on those securities as the bank reconfigured the portfolio to emphasize taxable income 
state and political subdivision securities comprised of the portfolio as of december   compared to of the portfolio as of december  at december   us treasury securities were essentially unchanged at million 
in the second half of the company purchased corporate bonds and asset backed securities in the amount of million and million which comprised and of the portfolio as of december  collateralized debt obligations cdo decreased to million as of december   from million at december  in the case of the cdo fair value measurement  management included a risk premium adjustment to reflect an estimated amount that a market participant would demand because of uncertainty in cash flows in both periods 
a detailed discussion of the market activity and the valuation of the cdo securities is found in note and note  respectively  of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as mentioned below in the liquidity section  the cash flows from the security calls  prepayments  maturities and sales were substantially offset by a decrease in funding in the other short term borrowings 
the net unrealized losses in the portfolio were million at december  as compared to net unrealized losses of million as of december   primarily due to changes in interest rates at december  loans total loans were billion as of december   a decrease of million  or  from billion as of december  the lack of demand from qualified borrowers through that year hindered 
table of contents growth in the loan portfolio 
as discussed in the loan loss provision section above  management continued to emphasize loan portfolio quality in and as a result million of net loan charge offs were recorded in down from to million in the largest overall category decrease was in real estate commercial loans  which decreased million  or  since december  the residential real estate and real estate construction loan sector decreased million  or  and million  or  respectively  since december  the loan portfolio reflects the general economic health and profile of the communities in which the company operates 
throughout  the local economy continued to be affected by the overall decline in economic conditions that has been experienced nationwide 
the real estate related activity and market valuations have negatively impacted the company since because the company is located in a growth corridor with significant open space  real estate lending including commercial  residential  and construction has been and continues to be a sizeable portion of the portfolio 
these categories comprised of the portfolio as of december   compared to of the portfolio as of december  the commercial and industrial loan sector also decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the company remains committed to overseeing and managing its loan portfolio to attempt to avoid unnecessarily high credit concentrations in accordance with the occ consent order the consent order as well as general interagency guidance on risk management 
consistent with those commitments  management updated its asset diversification plan and policy and anticipates that the percentage of real estate lending to the overall portfolio will decrease in the future 
installment loans  overdrafts  and lease financing receivables also decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  almost all of that decrease was in the installment portfolio and was primarily attributable to decreased demand from qualified borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million at year end and  respectively 
the company identified higher risk loans and created a cre pool with a higher qualitative factor in that higher risk pool and estimated factor approach remained in place throughout and and was similar to the high risk pool approach that was taken for the construction and development category that began at december  the elevated estimated factor approach for a higher risk c d pool continued until problem loan indicators and volume in that category declined at september  and credit review management resumed a single c d pool designation at that time 
the pooled factor estimate for the higher risk cre pool was increased from at december   as compared to at december  all risk factors and related segments are reassessed quarterly by the company  and as a result  the qualitative factors remained the same in as compared to one measure of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to total loans 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to as of december  in management s judgment  an adequate allowance for estimated losses has been established  however  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the estimated amounts in the future 
management  along with many other financial institutions  remains cautious about the current economic environment and outlook including the continued elevated levels of unemployment 
furthermore  the sustained slowdown in the real estate market could continue to adversely affect collateral values 
these events adversely affect cash flows generally for both commercial and individual borrowers  and as a result  the company could continue to experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies  and losses on loans in future periods 
other assets other real estate owned oreo increased million from million at december   to million at december  strong disposition activity and valuation write downs in the fourth quarter were counterbalanced by numerous additions  including large dollar additions  to oreo assets  leading to an overall quarterly decrease of million from oreo assets of million at september  in the fourth quarter of  management successfully converted collateral securing problem loans to properties ready for disposition  spent as needed on development improvements  transacted asset dispositions and recorded valuation adjustments as shown below in thousands 
as a result  holdings of single family residences  multi
