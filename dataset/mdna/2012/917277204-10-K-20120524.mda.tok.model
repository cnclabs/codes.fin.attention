item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with  and we qualify our discussion in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere within this annual report on form k  the material contained under part  item description of business and part i  item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k  and the cautionary disclosure about forward looking statements at the front of part i of this of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets innovative  proprietary products for the treatment of voiding dysfunctions 
our primary focus is on two products the urgent pc neuromodulation system  which we believe is the only fda cleared minimally invasive  office based neuromodulation therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder oab and associated symptoms of urinary urgency  urinary frequency  and urge incontinence  and macroplastique implants a urethral bulking agent for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence primarily due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency isd 
outside of the us  our urgent pc system is also approved for treatment of fecal incontinence  and macroplastique is also approved for treatment of male stress incontinence and vesicoureteral reflux 
our sales during the past four years have been significantly influenced by the availability of third party reimbursement for ptns treatments 
sales of our urgent pc system grew rapidly during fiscal and with rapid market acceptance of ptns treatments that were reimbursed under a listed current procedure technology cpt code 
however  during the first quarter of our fiscal the american medical association ama advised the medical community that the previously recommended listed cpt code for reimbursement for ptns treatments be replaced with an unlisted cpt code 
as a result  many third party insurers delayed or denied reimbursement for ptns treatments  and sales of our urgent pc system in the us declined from a peak of million in the first quarter of our fiscal to a range of million to million per quarter in the six subsequent fiscal quarters ended december we responded by sponsoring several randomized  controlled clinical studies over the following two years  and supported by publication of these clinical studies in us peer reviewed journals  we applied for  and effective january the ama granted  a category cpt code for ptns treatments 
the ama advised us of this decision prior to the effective date and we began to expand our sales organization in anticipation of increased interest in our urgent pc 
we have expanded our us field sales and support organization from employed sales representatives and six independent manufacturer s representatives on april  to employed sales representatives and one independent manufacturer s representative on march  our employed sales representatives generated approximately of our us sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal and approximately in fiscal we also focused our efforts on expanding reimbursement coverage with the medicare carriers and private payers by instituting a comprehensive program to educate their medical directors regarding the clinical effectiveness  cost effectiveness and patient benefits of ptns treatments using our urgent pc system 
as of march   ten regional medicare carriers representing states  with approximately million covered lives  provide coverage for ptns treatments 
in addition  we estimate that private payers providing insurance to approximately million lives provide coverage for ptns treatments 
with the availability of a cpt category code and expanded reimbursement coverage from third party payers  as well as an expanded sales organization  our us urgent pc sales of million in the year ended march  grew over sales during the year ended march  in addition  because of the discontinuation in the marketplace of a competing product and our expanded sales organization  sales of our macroplastique product in the us of million in the year ended march  grew over sales during the year ended march  at march   three regional medicare carriers representing states  with approximately million covered lives  continued to decline reimbursement coverage for ptns treatments 
we participated during fiscal with two medicare beneficiaries who filed administrative appeals for reconsideration of the decisions of two of those regional medicare carriers 
in april  one of those two regional medicare carriers  with million covered lives  retired its negative coverage decision and subsequently in may published their decision to cover ptns treatments retroactive to april  the second appeal remains pending 
we also understand that in calendar  and as part of the plans announced by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to consolidate the regional carriers  two regional medicare carriers currently reimbursing for ptns treatments are expected to be consolidated into the regional medicare carrier that recently retired its negative policy 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services expects to continue to consolidate the regional medicare claims administrators and there is no guarantee that medicare beneficiaries in a region with reimbursement coverage will continue to be reimbursed when consolidated into a regional medicare carrier with a negative reimbursement policy  or  if reimbursed  the coverage would remain unchanged 
we continue to work with the medical directors of both medicare and private payers to expand coverage of ptns treatments  and to ensure that coverage continues after the number of medicare regions is decreased and regional medicare administrators are transitioned 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following can be characterized as critical accounting policies and are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
these critical policies may require the application of a higher level of judgment by us  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of ownership have passed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we include in net sales shipping and handling charges that we bill to customers  and include the related shipping and handling costs that we incur in cost of goods sold 
we present our sales in our income statement net of taxes  such as sales  use  value added and certain excise taxes  collected from the customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
typically our agreements contain no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
we sell our products to clinics  healthcare institutions  physicians and other healthcare providers  and to distributors 
the distributor payment terms are not contingent on the distributor selling the product to end users 
customers do not have the right to return unsold products except for warranty claims 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last three years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 
accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimated allowance for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
we are not always able to accurately or timely anticipate changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to our customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
historically  the accounts receivable balances we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our products and may require additional inventory reserves 
historically  inventories we have written off have generally been within our expectations 
foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc foreign currency matters 
we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we use judgment to forecast future cash flows including forecasting revenues and margins  and working capital needs 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we did not record any impairment charge in fiscal years  or 
table of contents share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation costs under asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options and restricted shares  in our financial statements 
we measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees of our subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands 
the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  mortality  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation retirement benefits  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs in the statement of operations  but are recognized in future years over the expected average future service of the active employees or the average remaining life expectancies of inactive employees 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 
in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards is subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that we had an ownership change under section with the issuance of our common stock in public offerings in december and also in july accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december and after december and prior to july are limited

net sales in the us of our urgent pc system increased in fiscal  from million in fiscal reflecting one quarter s results under the new category cpt code and an upward trend in sequential quarterly growth in the number of customers and the resulting increase in the sale of the lead sets 
in the fiscal first quarter ended june  we had customers purchasing  lead set boxes 
in the fiscal fourth quarter ended march  we had customers purchasing  lead set boxes 
we are expanding the customer base and the customers have ramped up their practice in light of the decision by several medicare carriers and private payers to cover ptns treatments using our urgent pc

gross profit was million in fiscal  or of net sales 
in fiscal  compared to fiscal  we had a favorable impact of increase in capacity absorption of approximately percentage points and a favorable impact of product mix of approximately percentage points  essentially offset by the negative impacts of changes in the currency exchange rates from our foreign currency denominated sales and the additional costs in the first half of the fiscal year associated with the sourcing of our urgent pc lead sets from a secondary supplier

table of contents other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  foreign currency exchange and other non operating costs when incurred 
net other income was   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
we recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in currency rates between the us dollar the functional reporting currency and the euro and british pound currencies of our subsidiaries  as well as their effect on the dollar denominated short term intercompany obligations between us and our foreign subsidiaries

non gaap financial measures the following table reconciles our operating loss calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges for share based compensation  and depreciation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures described above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
we use these non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes and incentive compensation for senior management because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the operating performance of our business 
analysts and investors frequently ask us for this information 
we believe that they use these measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies 
our non gaap operating loss for fiscal  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the fiscal decrease in non gaap operating loss is attributed primarily to an increase in net sales which more than offset the increase in non gaap spending 
the fiscal increase in non gaap operating loss is attributed primarily to an increase in non gaap spending  offset partially by an increase in net sales

table of contents expense adjustments gaap share based compensation depreciation amortization non gaap year ended march  gross profit of net sales operating expenses general administrative research and development selling and marketing amortization operating loss liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
at march   we had total cash and investments of million  which includes million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments 
cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we used this cash primarily to fund the operating loss  net of non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and equity compensation  of million  million and million in the respective years 
we have continued to show an operating loss because we have continued to invest  primarily in sales and marketing  to grow our us business 
in addition to the use of cash for operating activities  we also used cash to fund the increase in net operating assets of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  primarily for increases in receivables and inventory to support the increase in sales 
in fiscal we used  for net operating activities to fund the increase in receivables and decrease in payables and accrued liabilities 
in fiscal  we used  in investing activities to purchase property  plant and equipment compared with  in fiscal  and  in fiscal in fiscal  we generated proceeds from financing activities of  from the exercise of stock options  compared with million in fiscal from the net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock and million from the exercise of warrants we had issued in previous financing transactions 
sources of liquidity 
uroplasty bv  our subsidiary  has an agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line secured by our facility in geleen  the netherlands 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line at march  and march  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs for beyond the next twelve months 
although we have historically not generated cash from operations because we have yet to achieve profitability  we anticipate that we will become profitable and generate excess cash from operations prior to the full use of the current available cash and investments 
to achieve this however  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which in turn may be partially dependent upon re establishing broader reimbursement for our urgent pc product 
we cannot guarantee that we will be entirely successful at this 
if we fail to meet our projections of profitability and cash flow  or determine to use cash for matters we have not currently projected  we may need to again seek financing to meet our cash needs 
we cannot assure you that such financing  if needed  will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents commitments and contingencies 
we expect to continue to incur costs for clinical studies to support our ongoing marketing efforts and to meet regulatory requirements 
we also expect to continue to incur significant expenses to support our us sales and marketing organization  and for regulatory activities 
in fiscal we plan to start on two multiyear studies a pilot clinical study in the u 
s  for the use of our urgent pc for the treatment of fecal incontinence and a clinical study and product design for a minimally invasive implantable product for treatment of oab 
we estimate we will spend million in fiscal for this 
future payments under our contractual obligations as of march   consisting of royalties  purchase commitments  and operating leases  are summarized below payments due by period total less than year years years more than years minimum royalty payments a minimum purchase agreement b operating lease commitments c total contractual obligations a under a royalty agreement we pay royalties of five percent of net sales of macroplastique in countries where a patent is filed subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until certain patents referenced in the agreement expire in and under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of great britain pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
we recognized an aggregate of   and  of royalty expense  under these agreements in fiscal  and  respectively 
b in our normal course of business we have commitments  generally for periods of less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
c in january  we entered into a long term lease with liberty property limited partnership for an  square foot facility for our us headquarters located at feltl road  minnetonka  minnesota 
the lease  effective may   has a term of months  requires average annual minimum rent payments of approximately  and requires payments for operating expenses we estimate at approximately  over months 
we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven current and nineteen former employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for the current employees 
we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the netherlands subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we also have a defined benefit pension plan for six former employees of our uk subsidiary 
we closed this plan to further accrual for all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
the following table presents the sensitivity of our funded status as of march   and fiscal pension expense to the following changes in key assumptions increase decrease funded status at march  increase decrease fiscal pension expense assumption increase in discount rate by percentage point decrease in discount rate by percentage point increase in estimated return on assets by percentage point n a  decrease of estimated return on assets by percentage point n a  increase in inflation rate by percentage point decrease in inflation rate by percentage point increase in compensation increase by percentage point decrease in compensation increase by percentage point 
table of contents product liability 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims  some of which may have a negative impact on our business 
any defects or risks that we have not yet identified with our products may give rise to product liability claims 
our existing million of worldwide product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from liabilities we may incur or we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage and it is ultimately determined that we are liable  our business could suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk or availability 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of marketable securities  including money market funds  us government securities  and certain bank obligations 
our cash and cash equivalents as of march  include liquid money market accounts 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business because of the global nature of our operations 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro and the british pound 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between our operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states  while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect because our products are currently manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of any pricing actions we may take as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies decreases 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to our foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately  on our fiscal sales 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impacts on the related cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the applicable foreign currencies
