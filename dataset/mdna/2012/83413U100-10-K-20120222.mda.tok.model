critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of portfolio investments we conduct the valuation of our assets  pursuant to which our net asset value is determined  at all times consistent with gaap  and the act 
our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the closing price on the day of valuation 
we may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets 
when doing so  we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to gaap to determine the fair value of the security 
if determined adequate  we use the quote obtained 
securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that  in the judgment of our investment adviser or board of directors  does not represent fair value  shall be valued as follows i each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  ii preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management  iii independent third party valuation firms engaged by  or on behalf of  the board of directors will conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and make their own assessment for all material assets  iv the board of directors will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the investment adviser and  where appropriate  the respective third party valuation firms 
the recommendation of fair value will generally be based on the following factors  as relevant the nature and realizable value of any collateral including credit risk  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the issuer does business and  and comparisons to publicly traded securities 
securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include  but are not limited to  the following private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market  securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available  debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market  securities whose prices are stale  securities affected by significant events  and securities that the investment adviser believes were priced incorrectly 

table of contents determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on our financial statements 
gaap fair value measurement guidance classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the company has the ability to access examples include active exchange traded equity securities  exchange traded derivatives  and most us government and agency securities 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level inputs include the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets examples include corporate and municipal bonds  which trade infrequently  c pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability examples include most over the counter derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  and d pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability examples include certain of our private debt and equity investments and long dated or complex derivatives including certain equity and currency derivatives 
fair value measurements as of december  level level level total assets bank debt senior secured loans subordinated debt corporate notes preferred equity common equity partnership interests warrants derivative assets interest rate cap derivative assets forward contracts at december  the fair value of investments classified as level was million or of total investments 
one asset with a fair value of million was transferred out of level to level during because of the increase in availability and reliability of third party market quotes for this investments 
subsequently  prior to end of  this asset was repaid at par 
additionally  during  one asset with a december  fair value of million was transferred from level to level as trading restrictions expired on this publicly traded equity investment 

table of contents at december  the fair value of investments classified as level was million or of total investments 
two assets with a combined fair value of million were transferred out of level to level during because of the increase in availability and reliability of third party market quotes for these investments 
additionally  during  one asset with a fair value of million was transferred from level to level when trading restrictions expired on a publicly traded equity investment 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are as follows sales gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated by using the specific identification method 
interest income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as part of interest income 
we have loans in our portfolio that contain a pik provision 
pik interest is accrued at the contractual rates and added to the loan principal on the reset dates 
non accrual loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment about ultimate collectability of principal 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
payment in kind interest we have investments in our portfolio which contain a pik interest provision 
pik interest is added to the principal balance of the investment and is recorded as income 
for us to maintain our status as a ric  substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not collected any cash with respect to pik securities 
new accounting pronouncements and accounting standards updates in may  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu was issued concurrently with international financial reporting standards no 
ifrs  fair value measurements  to provide largely identical guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements as is currently required under asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic 
the new standards do not extend the use of fair value but  rather  provide guidance about how fair value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under ifrs or gaap 
for gaap  most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or wording changes to align with ifrs asu eliminates the concepts of in use and in exchange when measuring fair value of all financial instruments 
for level fair value measurements  the asu requires that our disclosure include quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs  a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in the unobservable inputs and the interrelationship between inputs  and a description of our valuation process 
public companies are required to apply asu prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  upon adoption of asu  it is not expected that it will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements and the company is currently evaluating the impact on its disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the year ended december   certain of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates and our senior secured revolving credit facilities and term loan also bear floating rate interest 
interest rates on these loans are typically based on floating libor and reset to current market rates every one to six months 
a moderate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our net investment income 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options  swaps  caps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the year ended december   we purchased two libor caps on a total of million of notional for years 
if during the three year contract period libor exceeds  we will receive payments from the counterparty equal to the difference between libor and on million 
the cost of the caps was million 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in interest income net of interest expense should interest rates increase by or basis points or decrease by basis points 
investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments held at december  interest expense is calculated separately for each of our borrowings 
for our floating rate million term loan we use the balance and interest rate as of december  and adjust the interest rate based on the hypothetical changes below 
for our floating rate credit facility we use the average balance for the year ended december  as it fluctuates with our periodic cash requirements and we calculate interest expense using the interest rate as of december  adjusted for the hypothetical changes in rates below 
the base interest rate case assumes the rates on our portfolio investments remain as they were on december  all of the hypothetical calculations are based on a model of our portfolio for the twelve months subsequent to december  and assume no change to any input other than the underlying base interest rates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
