item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item  included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are an automated global electronic market maker and broker specializing in routing orders and executing and processing trades in securities  futures and foreign exchange instruments on more than electronic exchanges and trading venues around the world 
since our inception in  we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker dealer functions 
the advent of electronic exchanges in the last years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and trading venues into one automatically functioning  computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention 
in connection with our ipo priced on may   ibg  inc purchased of the membership interests in ibg llc  became the sole managing member of ibg llc and began to consolidate ibg llc s financial results into its financial statements 
overview of recapitalization transactions and our organizational structure prior to the ipo  we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure 
our primary assets are our ownership of approximately of the membership interests of ibg llc  the current holding company for our businesses  and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of ibg llc 
the remaining approximately of ibg llc membership interests are held by ibg holdings llc  a holding company that is owned by our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  thomas peterffy  and his affiliates  management and other employees of ibg llc  and certain other members 
the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with offerings by us of shares of our common stock 
purchases of ibg llc membership interests  held by ibg holdings llc  by the company are governed by the exchange agreement by and among the company  ibg holdings llc  ibg llc and the members of ibg llc  dated as of may  the exchange agreement  a copy of the fully executed agreement was filed as an exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and filed with the sec on november  under the exchange agreement  ibg holdings llc may request redemption of its membership interests in ibg llc and the company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate a public offering of a number of shares of class a common stock common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests for which redemption has been requested 
upon consummation of such public offering  the company is required to purchase from ibg holdings llc that number of ibg llc membership interests equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption  at a purchase price per membership interest equal to the offering price in such public offering 
however  under the exchange agreement  the company is not obligated to effect any purchase of the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc unless and until the company has consummated a public offering of a number of shares of common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption 
subsequent to the ipo  no public offerings have been consummated 

table of contents as an alternative  at the option of and upon mutual agreement of the company  ibg holdings llc and ibg llc  instead of  or in addition to  consummating one or more public offerings  redemptions of ibg holdings llc membership interests may be effected by using cash on hand at ibg llc and corresponding redemptions by ibg llc of its membership interests held by ibg holdings llc 
this alternative funding method would not impose any obligations on the company 
in  and some of the ibg holdings llc membership interests were redeemed using cash from ibg llc 
in june  with the consent of ibg holdings llc and the company on its own behalf and acting as the sole managing member of ibg llc  ibg llc agreed to redeem certain membership interests from ibg holdings llc through the sale of common stock and to distribute the proceeds of such sale to the beneficial owners of such membership interests 
on august   the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec for the issuance of additional shares in connection with ibg holdings llc requesting redemption of a portion of its member interests in ibg llc 
on august   a prospectus supplement file number was filed by the company with the sec to issue  shares of common stock in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of member interests in ibg llc 
the company expects that future redemptions will be funded through the issuance of common stock 
as part of a redeployment of the company s capital to its shareholders  the company effected a series of dividend payments  including a dividend of per share  which was paid to the company s common shareholders in december during the second quarter of  the company declared and paid a cash dividend of per share and has continued this quarterly dividend policy through the current fiscal year end and into the first quarter of we expect to pay a quarterly dividend of per share to our common stockholders for the foreseeable future 
business segments the company reports its results in two business segments  electronic brokerage and market making 
these segments are analyzed separately as we derive our revenues from these two principal business activities as well as allocate resources and assess performance 
electronic brokerage 
we conduct our electronic brokerage business through our ib subsidiaries 
as an electronic broker  we execute  clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers 
capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business  ib s systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost  in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account 
we offer our customers access to all classes of tradable  primarily exchange listed products  including stocks  bonds  options  futures  forex and mutual funds traded on more than exchanges and market centers and in countries around the world seamlessly 
market making 
we conduct our market making business through our th subsidiaries 
as one of the largest market makers on many of the world s leading exchanges  we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid offer spreads over a broad base of over  tradable  exchange listed products 
as principal  we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities  we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time 
our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day  thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times 
this real time rebalancing of our portfolio  together with our real time proprietary risk management system  enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up market and down market scenarios 

table of contents business environment the global financial markets were impacted by several events throughout which drove exchange traded options volumes and volatility levels higher  contributing to market conditions that enhanced our results in both the electronic brokerage and market making segments 
the first part of the year was relatively subdued until the earthquake and tsunami in japan caused a brief spike in trading and volatility levels 
then  in august  a series of economic news items shook the markets and caused volatility levels to remain elevated for several weeks 
these developments included the us government credit rating downgrade by standard poor s  ongoing concerns over european government debt and the threat of credit rating downgrades across the euro zone 
in addition to higher volatility and trading volumes  bid offer spreads in exchange listed options also widened meaningfully from the historically low levels of the prior year when high frequency trading activity peaked 
the improvement in these conditions benefited our market making trading gains and also increased commission revenues in the brokerage segment  as our customers took advantage of periods of higher volatility 
our reputation for being one of the lowest cost brokers that provides high quality executions and state of the art trading technology continued to spread  mostly by word of mouth 
our customer accounts grew by in mf global s collapse during the fourth quarter raised new concerns amongst investors over the safety and security of their assets 
we took this opportunity to review our procedures for protecting customer assets and our automated risk controls that are designed to minimize the risk of large customer losses 
to further enhance protection of our customers assets  ib llc sought and received approval from finra to perform the securities reserve computation on a daily basis instead of once per week  as prescribed by the rules 
ib llc initiated daily computations in december  along with daily adjustments of the money set aside in safekeeping for our customers 
following is a summary of the key profit drivers that affect our business and how they compared to the prior year global trading volumes 
according to data received from exchanges worldwide  volumes in exchange listed equity based options increased by approximately globally and in the us for the year ended december   as compared to during we accounted for approximately of the exchange listed equity based options including options on etfs and stock index products volume traded worldwide and approximately of exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us this compares to approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded worldwide and approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us in it is important to note that this metric is not directly correlated with our profits 
see the tables on pages of this annual report on form k for additional details regarding our trade volumes  contract and share volumes and brokerage statistics 
bid offer spreads 
after reaching a historic low in the third quarter of  bid offer spreads on us exchange traded options have been gradually widening over the past several quarters 
as reported by the nasdaq omx phlx market  bid offer spreads in were approximately wider than in we believe this increase can be attributed to elevated levels of volatility throughout the year as well as the heightened scrutiny over high frequency trading firms that began after the may flash crash 
regulators and exchanges began enacting new rules last year that eliminated some of the advantages high frequency traders hft s had over registered market makers 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which was signed into law last summer  are also expected to impose strict regulations on the hedge fund industry 
volatility 
our market making profits are generally correlated with market volatility since we typically maintain an overall long volatility position  which protects us against a severe market dislocation in either direction 
based on the chicago board options exchange volatility index 
table of contents vix  the average volatility level was during while this was only higher than it was during  the vix spent days above in versus only days above this level in the ratio of actual to implied volatility is also meaningful to our results 
because the cost of hedging our positions is based on implied volatility  while our trading profits are  in part  based on actual market volatility  a higher ratio is generally favorable and a lower ratio generally has a negative effect on our trading gains 
this ratio averaged approximately during  about higher than it was in currency fluctuations 
as a global market maker trading on exchanges around the world in multiple currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we actively manage this exposure by keeping our net worth in proportion to a defined basket of currencies we call the global 
because we report our financial results in us dollars  the change in the value of the global to the us dollar affects our earnings 
at the end of the third quarter  we increased the number of currencies in this basket from six to to further diversify our risk and to better align our hedging strategy with the currencies that we use in our business 
the value of the global  as measured in us dollars  at december  declined compared to its value at december  this had a relatively small negative impact on our comprehensive earnings 
financial overview diluted earnings per share were for year ended december  the calculation of diluted earnings per share is detailed in note  initial public offering and recapitalization  to the audited consolidated financial statements  in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  results for reflect a negative per share impact from additional taxes triggered by the approximately billion special cash dividend paid in december the company considers the special dividend to be non operating in nature 
on a comprehensive basis  which includes the effect of changes in the us dollar value of the company s us subsidiaries  diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  compared to diluted earnings per share of for the same period in on a non gaap basis  diluted earnings per share  adjusted for the special dividend and for currency translation effects  were  as reported in reported results on a comprehensive basis reflect the gaap convention adopted in that requires the reporting of currency translation results contained in other comprehensive income as part of reportable earnings 
previously  currency translation results were reported as a component of changes in total equity in the statement of financial condition 
for a reconciliation of our us gaap to non gaap results for see the gaap to non gaap reconciliation and footnotes section on page of this annual report on form k 
in december  the company paid a special cash dividend of per share to holders of the company s common stock  which had a negative impact on our earnings per share of approximately for the year ended december  the dividend of per share was part of a series of dividends that had no effect on our reported income before tax on a consolidated basis 
however  the us federal income tax liability triggered by the dividends is reported as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
the above dividend resulted from the following transaction 
on december   timber hill europe ag the ag paid its sole shareholder  ibg llc  a dividend of million 
the ag s pretax earnings had not previously been subject to taxation in the united states 
us federal income taxes on the company s share of this dividend were million 
please refer to the section below entitled non gaap financial measures for a discussion of the impact of the dividend on our reported results for for the year ended december   our net revenues were  million and income before income taxes was million  compared to net revenues of million and income before 
table of contents income taxes of million for compared to  trading gains increased in  commissions and execution fees increased by and net interest income increased 
our pre tax margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our electronic brokerage segment grew compared to customer accounts grew from the prior year and customer equity increased during commissions and execution fees increased by and net interest income grew by from the prior year

total daily average revenue trades darts for cleared and execution only customers increased to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   income before income taxes in our market making segment increased  compared with trading gains were aided by an increase in currency translation gains  which contributed of the rise over the prior year 
pre tax margin increased to in compared to in market making  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period may be materially affected by volumes in the global financial markets  the level of competition and other factors 
electronic brokerage is more predictable  but it is dependent on customer activity  growth in customer accounts and assets  interest rates and other factors 
for a further discussion of the factors  that may affect our future operating results  please see the description of risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
comprehensive income reported results on a comprehensive basis reflect the company s early adoption of accounting standards update  comprehensive income asu issued in june  which requires the presentation of a statement of comprehensive income  replacing the former statement of income 
the statement of comprehensive income reports currency translation results that are a component of other comprehensive income oci directly in this statement 
previously  oci was reported as a component of changes in total equity in the statement of financial condition 
in periods prior to the adoption of asu  we reported non gaap measures for the purpose of incorporating all currency translation gains and losses in the statement of income 
this reporting method is now required under gaap guidance 
the following two tables present net revenues and income before income taxes for each of our business segments for the periods indicated 
net revenues of each of our business segments and our total net revenues are summarized below year ended december  in millions electronic brokerage market making corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 

table of contents income before income taxes of each of our business segments and our total income before income taxes are summarized below year ended december  in millions electronic brokerage market making corporate total corporate includes corporate related activities as well as inter segment eliminations 
revenue trading gains trading gains are generated in the normal course of market making 
trading revenues are  in general  proportional to the trading activity in the markets 
our revenue base is highly diversified and comprised of millions of relatively small individual trades of various financial products traded on electronic exchanges  primarily in stocks  options and futures 
trading gains accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading gains include a portion of translation gains and losses stemming from the basket of foreign currencies we call the global  which we employ to carry out our currency hedging strategy 
a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
trading gains also include revenues from net dividends 
market making activities require us to hold a substantial inventory of equity securities 
we derive significant revenues in the form of dividend income from these equity securities 
this dividend income is largely offset by dividend expense incurred when we make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase the stock after the dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading gains and our net interest income from the market making segment are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
our trading gains are geographically diversified 
in  and  we generated  and respectively  of our trading gains from operations conducted internationally 

table of contents commissions and execution fees we earn commissions and execution fees from our cleared customers for whom we act as executing and clearing brokers and from our non cleared customers for whom we act as an executing broker only 
we have a commission structure that allows customers to choose between an all inclusive bundled rate or an unbundled rate that has lower commissions for high volume customers 
for unbundled commissions  we charge regulatory and exchange fees  at our cost  separately from our commissions  adding transparency to our fee structure 
commissions and execution fees accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commissions and execution fees are geographically diversified 
in  and we generated  and  respectively  of commissions and execution fees from operations conducted internationally 
interest income and interest expense we earn interest on customer funds segregated in safekeeping accounts  on customer borrowings on margin  secured by marketable securities these customers hold with us  from our investment in government treasury securities  from borrowing securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on bank balances 
interest income accounted for  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income is partially offset by interest expense 
we pay interest on cash balances customers hold with us  for cash received from lending securities in the general course of our market making and brokerage activities  and on our borrowings 
during we reduced the interest rate offered on our senior notes which resulted in a reduction in our senior notes outstanding by million and a reduction in interest expense on our senior notes of million compared with the prior year 
interest expense was  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have automated and integrated our securities lending system with our trading system 
as a result  we have been able to tailor our securities lending activity to produce more optimal results when taken together with trading gains see description under trading gains above 
our net interest income accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income other income consists primarily of payment for order flow income  market data fee income and mark to market gains or losses on non market making securities primarily strategic investments 
our other income accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs and expenses execution and clearing expenses our largest single expense category is execution and clearing expenses  which includes the costs of executing and clearing our market making and electronic brokerage trades  as well as other direct expenses  including payment for order flow  regulatory fees and market data fees 
execution fees are paid primarily to electronic exchanges and market centers on which we trade 
clearing fees are paid to clearing houses and clearing agents 
payments for order flow are made as part of exchange mandated programs and to otherwise attract order volume to our system 
market data fees are fees that we must pay to third parties to receive streaming quotes and related information 

table of contents employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits includes salaries  bonuses and other incentive compensation plans  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs and other related employee costs 
occupancy  depreciation and amortization occupancy expense consists primarily of rental payments on office and data center leases and related occupancy costs  such as utilities 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets such as computing and communications hardware as well as amortization of leasehold improvements and capitalized in house software development 
communications communications expense consists primarily of the cost of voice and data telecommunications lines supporting our business including connectivity to exchanges around the world 
general and administrative expenses in this category are primarily incurred for professional services  such as legal and audit work  and other operating expenses such as advertising and exchange membership lease expenses 
income tax expense we pay us federal  state and local income taxes on our taxable income  which is proportional to the percentage of ibg llc owned by ibg  inc our subsidiaries are subject to income tax in the respective jurisdictions in which they operate 
non controlling interest we are the sole managing member of ibg llc and  as such  operate and control all of the business and affairs of ibg llc and its subsidiaries and consolidate ibg llc s financial results into our financial statements 
we hold approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
ibg holdings llc is owned by the original members of ibg llc and holds approximately ownership interest in ibg llc 
we reflect ibg holdings llc s ownership as a non controlling interest in our consolidated statement of financial condition  consolidated statement of comprehensive income  consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows 
our share of ibg llc s net income  excluding ibg holdings llc s non controlling interest  is approximately and similarly  outstanding shares of our common stock represent approximately of the outstanding membership interests of ibg llc 
certain trends and uncertainties we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
over the past several years  the effects of market structure changes  competition in particular  from hfts and market conditions have  during certain periods  exerted downward pressure on bid offer spreads realized by market makers 
retail broker dealer participation in the equity markets has fluctuated over the past few years due to investor sentiment  market conditions and a variety of other factors 
retail transaction volumes may not be sustainable and are not predictable 

table of contents in recent years  in an effort to improve the quality of their executions as well as increase efficiencies  market makers have increased the level of automation within their operations  which may allow them to compete more effectively with us 
there has been increased scrutiny of equity and option market makers  hedge funds and soft dollar practices by the regulatory and legislative authorities 
new legislation or modifications to existing regulations and rules could occur in the future 
if there is consolidation among market centers this may adversely affect the value of our smart routing software 
a driver of our market making profits is the relationship between actual and implied volatility in the equities markets 
the cost of maintaining our conservative risk profile is based on implied volatility  while our profitability  in part  is based on actual volatility 
hence  our profitability is increased when actual volatility runs above implied volatility and it is decreased when actual volatility falls below implied volatility 
implied volatility tends to lag actual volatility 
see risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap financial measures non gaap measures are used to isolate items that the company s management views as non operating in nature  which is intended to give a clearer presentation of operating results 
given its material impact on our reported financial results  the following non gaap measure is presented for in december  we effected a series of dividend payments  culminating in a cash dividend of per share  which was paid to holders of ibkr common stock 
in total  ibg llc paid out about billion 
funding for this dividend originated with our swiss company  which paid a dividend to ibg llc  its parent company 
ibg llc  in turn  paid a dividend to its members  including interactive brokers group  inc  the public company 
on a consolidated reporting basis  these dividends had no effect on the company s reported income 
however  the original dividend from the swiss company was made from earnings that were not previously taxed in the us as a result  this triggered a us federal income tax liability for the company  which is reported as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
this income tax liability was funded by reserving a portion of the dividend that the company received 
the remaining after tax amount was paid to the company s common stockholders 
the result was cash flow neutral for the public company 
at december   approximately million of accumulated earnings that have not been previously subject to income tax in the us were held in the company s us subsidiaries 
additional dividends originating from these subsidiaries up to this amount as adjusted over time would be subject to us income tax  as described above 
dividends paid from the remaining equity capital would not be subject to additional income tax 
the company also decided to pay a dividend equivalent to employees holding unvested shares in our stock incentive plan 
this amounted to approximately million and was recorded as compensation expense 
in summary  this item reduced diluted eps by approximately for the year 
the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust this non operating item in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in order to achieve a proper representation of the company s financial performance

brokerage options and futures contract volumes increased and  respectively  market making options and futures contract volumes increased and  respectively  while brokerage stock share volume increased and market making stock share volume decreased 
in brokerage  although stock volume for the year was stable  we observed decreases primarily in low priced stocks after we raised risk margin requirements  to better protect against sudden price moves  on companies with small market capitalization 
in market making  decreases in stock volume resulted from targeted paring back of activity at certain exchanges to improve profitability and avoid high fees 
increased customer cash and margin balances contributed to an increase of million in net interest income in our brokerage segment 
in our market making segment  wider bid offer spreads in options  an increase in the ratio of actual to implied volatility and a reversal in currency translation losses contributed to an increase of million in trading gains

a large portion of the currency translation effects result from the holding of our equity in globals 
a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
included in trading gains are net dividends 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase stock after the ex dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes  reflecting the value of dividends paid to shareholders  must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
commissions and execution fees 
commissions and execution fees for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was driven by higher overall trade volume from our customers 
volume in options and futures contracts and stock shares increased by   and  respectively  for the year ended december  from the prior year 
total darts for cleared and execution only customers for the year ended december  increased to approximately  as compared to approximately  during the year ended december  darts for cleared customers  ie  customers for whom we execute trades as well as clear and carry positions  increased to approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the number of customer accounts grew by to approximately  at december   as compared to approximately  at december  average commission per dart for cleared customers  for the year ended december   decreased by less than to  as compared to for the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
net interest income interest income less interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  net interest income was derived primarily from the electronic brokerage segment during the year ended december  net interest earned by electronic brokerage increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  average customer cash balances increased by  to billion  and average customer fully secured margin borrowings increased  to billion  for the year ended december   as compared to billion and billion  respectively  for the year ended december  net fees earned by electronic brokerage from borrowing and lending securities increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to same period last year 
the average fed funds effective rate decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for market making  net interest income increased million from the prior year to million 
as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of 
table of contents market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income 
net interest income increased million as loan balances with ibg llc were reduced and the rates paid on those loans were lower than in the prior year 
in addition  net interest income from operating cash accounts increased million 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in net interest earned from securities borrowed and loaned 
average securities borrowed decreased by  to billion and average securities loaned increased by  to billion  for the year ended december  net interest earned from securities borrowed and loaned is also affected by the level of demand for securities positions held by our market making companies 
other income 
other income  for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  the primary revenue components of other income are market data fees collected from customers  order flow fees paid by us options exchanges and minimum activity fees from inactive customers 
the decrease in other income was driven by a million loss from our equity investment in mf global  which  following its bankruptcy filing  we revalued at zero during the fourth quarter of this loss was partially offset by a million increase in translation gains from our brokerage and corporate companies compared to the prior year 
of our translation gains  million was attributable to an increase in the value of a million tax credit receivable denominated in swiss francs and million was a result of increases in gains from foreign currency forward positions compared the prior year 
our losses were further offset by a million increase in market data and minimum activity fees compared to the prior year 
non interest expenses non interest expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million from million  during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher execution and clearing expenses  employee compensation and benefits expenses and general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  non interest expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from during the year ended december  execution and clearing 
execution and clearing expenses  for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december   as a result of higher trading volume in futures and options product classes 
in addition  regulatory fees increased million for the year ended december  as compared to  in part due to an increase in the sec securities transaction fee rate from per million to per million in january of this was partially offset by an increase in executions at venues that pay participants to provide liquidity 
as a market maker under the make or take pricing model  we are paid for providing liquidity instead of being charged payment for order flow fees 
employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expenses  for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million  as compared to the year ended december  this increase reflects the growth in the average number of employees to for the year ended december   as compared to for the prior year 
as we continue to grow  our focus on automation has allowed us to maintain a relatively small staff 
the continued recognition of costs associated with of our stock incentive plan also increased employee compensation and benefits expense

during the year ended december   our market making operations executed million trades  a decrease of compared to the number of trades executed in the year ended december  options and futures contracts increased and  respectively  and stock shares volume decreased by for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in trading gains was primarily due to tighter bid offer spreads on exchange listed options versus the previous year  increased competition from high frequency traders and foreign currency fluctuations as explained in the business environment section above 

table of contents included in trading gains are net dividends and currency translation gains and losses from market making activities 
dividend income and expense arise from holding market making positions over dates on which dividends are paid to shareholders of record 
when a stock pays a dividend  its market price is generally adjusted downward to reflect the value paid to the shareholders of record  which will not be received by those who purchase stock after the ex dividend date 
hence  the apparent gains and losses due to these price changes  reflecting the value of dividends paid to shareholders  must be taken together with the dividends paid and received  respectively  to accurately reflect the results of our market making operations 
as part of managing our overall exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we maintain a portion of our capital in foreign currencies

as a result of the way we have integrated our market making and securities lending systems  our trading income and our net interest income are interchangeable and depend on the mix of market making positions in our portfolio 
when implied interest rates in the equity and equity options and futures markets exceed the actual interest rates available to us  our market making systems tend to buy stock and sell it forward  which produces higher trading gains and lower net interest income 
when these rates are inverted  our market making systems tend to sell stock and buy it forward  which produces lower trading gains and higher net interest income

given that we manage a globally integrated market making portfolio  we have large and substantially offsetting positions in securities and commodities that trade on different exchanges that close at different times of the trading day 
as a result  there may be large and anomalous swings in the value of our positions daily and  accordingly  in our earnings in any period 
this is especially true on the last business day of each calendar quarter  although such swings tend to come back into equilibrium on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter contingencies our policy is to estimate and accrue for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings  to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with asc  contingencies 
potential losses that might arise out of tax audits  to the extent that such losses are more likely than not  would be estimated and accrued in accordance with asc significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability accrued with respect to litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses based on  among other factors  the progress of each case  our experience with and industry experience with similar cases and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  or where cases or proceedings are in the early stages  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
we have been from time to time subject to certain pending and legal actions which arise out of the normal course of business 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  particularly in proceedings where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages  or which are in their early stages 
we cannot predict with certainty the actual loss or range of loss related to such legal proceedings  the manner in which they will be resolved  the timing of final resolution or the ultimate settlement 
consequently  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses related to such legal matters  even in instances where it is reasonably possible that a future loss will be incurred 
as of december   we  along with certain of our subsidiaries  have been named parties to legal actions  which we and or such subsidiaries intend to defend vigorously 
although the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of management that the resolution of these actions is not expected to have a material effect  if any  on our business or financial condition  but may have a material impact on the results of operations for a given period 
as of december  and  reserves provided for potential losses related to litigation matters were not material 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with the codification requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
such estimates include the estimated value of investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting  the estimated useful lives of property and equipment  including capitalized internally developed software  the allowance for doubtful accounts  compensation accruals  tax liabilities and estimated contingency reserves 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
determining consolidated income tax expense requires significant judgments and estimates 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
bg  inc recognizes interest related to income tax matters as interest income or expense and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
our exposures to market risks arise from assumptions built into our pricing models  equity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations  changes in interest rates which impact our variable rate debt obligations  and risks relating to the extension of margin credit to our customers 
pricing model exposure our strategy as a market maker is to calculate quotes a few seconds ahead of the market and execute small trades at tiny but favorable differentials as a result 
this is made possible by our proprietary pricing model  which continuously evaluates and monitors the risks inherent in our portfolio  assimilates market data and reevaluates the outstanding quotes in our entire portfolio each second 
certain aspects of the model rely on historical prices of securities 
if the behavior of price movements of individual securities diverges substantially from what their historical behavior would predict  we might incur trading losses 
we attempt to limit such risks by diversifying our portfolio across many different options  futures and underlying securities and avoiding concentrations of positions based on the same underlying security 
historically  our losses from these events have been immaterial in comparison to our annual trading profits 
foreign currency exposure as a result of our international market making activities and accumulated earnings in our foreign subsidiaries  our income and net worth is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our european operations and some of our asian operations are conducted by our swiss subsidiary  the 
the is regulated by the swiss financial market supervisory authority as a securities dealer and its financial statements are presented in swiss francs 
accordingly  the is exposed to certain foreign exchange risks as described below the buys and sells futures contracts and securities denominated in various currencies and carries bank balances and borrows and lends such currencies in its regular course of business 
at the end of each accounting period the s assets and liabilities are translated into swiss francs for presentation in its financial statements 
the resulting gains or losses are reported as translation gain or loss in the s income statement 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  the s swiss franc balances are translated into us dollars for us gaap purposes 
the s translation gains or losses appear as such on ibg  inc s income statement  included in trading gains 
the s net worth is carried on the s books in swiss francs in accordance with swiss accounting standards 
at the end of each accounting period  the s net worth is translated at the then prevailing exchange rate into us dollars and the resulting gain or loss is reported as other comprehensive income  oci in our consolidated statement of financial condition and consolidated statement of comprehensive income  the latter as a result of the company s early adoption of asu  comprehensive income 
previously  oci was only reported as a component of changes in total equity in the statement of financial condition 
to a smaller extent  oci is also produced by our other non us subsidiaries 

table of contents historically  we have taken the approach of not hedging the above exposures to the us dollar  based on the notion that the cost of constantly hedging over the years would amount to more than the random impact of rate changes on our non us dollar balances 
for instance  an increase in the value of the swiss franc would be unfavorable to the earnings of the but would be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that the yearly translation gain or loss into us dollars is likely to move in the opposite direction 
in late  we began to expand our market making systems to incorporate cash forex and forex options to hedge our currency exposure at little or no cost 
in september  we began hedging our currency exposure throughout the day on a continuous basis 
in connection with the development of our currency hedging strategy  we determined to base our net worth in globals  a basket of currencies 
on october  we announced that we expanded the composition of the global from six to currencies 
the table below displays the component changes in detail 
us dollar usd amounts are calculated using exchange rates at september   the effective date for the change

usd eur gbp jpy aud cad chf hkd sek mxn dkk nok krw brl inr sgd total globals  as measured in usd as our forex market making systems continue to develop  and as more exchanges trade more forex based products electronically  we have observed more trading volume flowing through this system and  accordingly  we have been able to manage the risks in forex in the same low cost manner as we manage the risks of our market making in equity based products 
because we actively manage our global currency exposure by maintaining our equity in globals  we consider ourselves a global enterprise based in a diversified basket of currencies rather than a us dollar based company 
approximately of our equity is denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
interest rate risk we had no variable rate debt outstanding at december  under our senior secured revolving credit facility  we have the ability to choose borrowing tenors from overnight to twelve months  which permits us to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents we pay our electronic brokerage customers interest based on benchmark overnight interest rates in various currencies 
in a normal rate environment  we typically invest a portion of these funds in us government treasury securities with maturities of up to three months 
under these circumstances  if interest rates were to increase rapidly and substantially  in increments that were not reflected in the yields on these treasury securities  our net interest income from customer deposits would decrease 
based upon investments outstanding at december   we had minimal exposure of this nature 
we also face the potential for reduced net interest income from customer deposits due to interest rate spread compression in a low rate environment 
due to a currently low rate environment  a decrease of us benchmark interest rates to zero  or roughly  would reduce our net interest income by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we also face substantial interest rate risk due to positions carried in our market making business to the extent that long or short stock positions may have been established for future or forward dates on options or futures contracts and the value of such positions are impacted by interest rates 
we hedge such risks by entering into interest rate futures contracts 
to the extent that these futures positions do not perfectly hedge this interest rate risk  our trading gains may be adversely affected 
the amount of such risk cannot be quantified 
dividend risk we face dividend risk in our market making business as we derive significant revenues and incur significant expenses in the form of dividend income and expense  respectively  from our substantial inventory of equity securities  and must make significant payments in lieu of dividends on short positions in securities in our portfolio 
projected future dividends are an important component of pricing equity options and other derivatives  and incorrect projections may lead to trading losses 
the amount of these risks cannot be quantified 
margin credit we extend margin credit to our customers  which is subject to various regulatory requirements 
margin credit is collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts 
the risks associated with margin credit increase during periods of fast market movements or in cases where collateral is concentrated and market movements occur 
during such times  customers who utilize margin credit and who have collateralized their obligations with securities may find that the securities have a rapidly depreciating value and may not be sufficient to cover their obligations in the event of a liquidation 
we are also exposed to credit risk when our customers execute transactions  such as short sales of options and equities  that can expose them to risk beyond their invested capital 
we expect this kind of exposure to increase with growth in our overall business 
because we indemnify and hold harmless our clearing firms from certain liabilities or claims  the use of margin credit and short sales may expose us to significant off balance sheet risk in the event that collateral requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur and those customers fail to satisfy their obligations 
as of december   we had billion in margin credit extended to our customers 
the amount of risk to which we are exposed from the margin credit we extend to our customers and from short sale transactions by our customers is unlimited and not quantifiable as the risk is dependent upon analysis of a potential significant and undeterminable rise or fall in stock prices 
our account level margin credit requirements meet or exceed those required by regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve 
as a matter of practice  we enforce real time margin compliance monitoring and liquidate customers positions if their equity falls below required margin requirements 
we have a comprehensive policy implemented in accordance with regulatory standards to assess and monitor the suitability of investors to engage in various trading activities 
to mitigate our risk  we 
table of contents also continuously monitor customer accounts to detect excessive concentration  large orders or positions  patterns of day trading and other activities that indicate increased risk to us 
our credit exposure is to a great extent mitigated by our policy of automatically evaluating each account throughout the trading day and closing out positions automatically for accounts that are found to be under margined 
while this methodology is effective in most situations  it may not be effective in situations where no liquid market exists for the relevant securities or commodities or where  for any reason  automatic liquidation for certain accounts has been disabled
