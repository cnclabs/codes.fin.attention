critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  and the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection 
sale of sba loans the company has the ability and the intent to sell all or a portion of certain sba loans in the loan portfolio and  as such  carries the saleable portion of these loans at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value 
at december  and december   the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
in calculating gain on the sale of sba loans  the bank performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portions of the loan 
the company assumptions are validated by reference to external market information 
investment securities our securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
the fair value of most securities classified as available for sale is based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
supplemental employee retirement plan the company has entered into supplemental employee retirement agreements with certain executive and senior officers 
the measurement of the liability under these agreements includes estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement  and expected benefit levels 
should these estimates prove materially wrong  we could incur additional or reduced expense to provide the benefits 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has sufficient taxable income from current and prior periods to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as such  we have provided no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets

the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of the borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of estimating specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the level of the related provision for loan losses are determined in management s judgment based on consideration of economic conditions borrowers financial condition loan impairment evaluation of industry trends historic losses  migrations and delinquency trends industry and other concentrations loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio periodic review and evaluation of problem loans off balance sheet risks assessments by regulators and other third parties in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio  the company also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a regular basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the decrease in the provision for credit losses for the year ending december  compared to the same period one year ago reflects lower charge offs and greater recoveries experienced during the current year combined with the improving condition of the company s loan portfolio 
based on an evaluation of the individual credits  historical credit loss experienced by loan type and economic conditions  management has allocated the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans at december of the previous five years as follows as of december  dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction land loans real estate other factoring and asset based sba other commercial real estate construction land loans real estate other factoring and asset based sba other beginning in the second quarter of  deterioration in economic conditions within the company s market area and  as applicable  the state of california and or national macroeconomic conditions resulted in increased stress to the loan portfolio  specifically construction and land development loans outside of the company s primary market of santa clara county and contiguous portions of san mateo and alameda counties 
in response to the deteriorating market conditions  the company undertook steps to aggressively reduce the exposure to construction and land development loans with particular emphasis on loans outside of its primary market 
management curtailed new loan origination  thoroughly reviewed collateral values of projects approaching maturity and conservatively evaluated the market prospects of collateral for indications of impairments 
during and  the company selectively originated new construction loans within its primary market that met the company s conservative underwriting standards 
at december   the company s land development portfolio was reduced to million with just million remaining exposure outside of the primary market area 
further  approximately of the remaining loans in this category are underwritten to amortizing term structures supported by cash flow from liquidity of the borrowers 
construction loans at december  increased to million with million remaining on projects outside of the primary market area 
in addition  at that date million  or  were loans to finance commercial projects 
the aggressive management of credits in this category has resulted in elevated levels of nonperforming assets as loans are placed on nonaccrual through the marketing phase of the underlying project 
in addition  loans placed on nonaccrual have been reduced to the level of indicated impairments 
this has resulted in an elevated level of charge offs 
management believes that this practice results in a recorded level of nonperforming assets that generally has been reduced to a net liquidation value  and as these assets are liquidated do not expect to incur additional significant losses 
nonperforming loans at december   on average  have been reduced by approximately of the remaining contractual balance  which was taken as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  non performing loans at december   on average  have been reduced by approximately for payment received in non accrual interest 
in response to the elevated level of charge offs  migration of construction and land portfolios  and general deterioration in economic conditions the company also increased provisions for potential loans losses and built the reserve to its highest level of approximately of total loans at june  due to positive trends in overall loan classifications during and  reflecting the improving condition of the loan portfolio combined with new loan production  the company has been able to modestly lower the level of reserves to of total loans at december  the coverage ratio  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at december  management believes that the coverage ratio reflects the conservative charge off practice and that the allowance is adequate for losses not specifically identified in impairment analyses 
at december  nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets reflects a substantial decrease compared to million  or of total assets on december  the following summarizes nonperforming assets and loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms at december      and as of december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis loans with principal or interest contracturally past due days or more nonperforming loans other real estate owned loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms nonperforming assets and restructured loans the nonperforming assets at december  consisted of seventeen loans on nonaccrual or days or more past due and still accruing totaling million  and other real estate owned valued at million 
nonperforming loans at december  were comprised of loans with legal contractual balances totaling approximately million reduced by million received in nonaccrual interest and impairment charges of million which have been charged against the allowance for credit losses 
as a result  there no longer was an indicated potential loss exposure pertaining to nonperforming loans and no impairment reserves were required to be included in the allowance for credit losses 
there were fifteen non accrual loans totaling million at december  and twenty four non accrual loans totaling million at december  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued and any accrued and unpaid interest is reversed when  in the opinion of management  there is significant doubt as to the collectability of interest or principal or when the payment of principal or interest is ninety days past due  unless the amount is well secured and in the process of collection

these concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on a loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal  or other actions intended to maximize collection 
in order for these loans to return to accrual status  the borrower must demonstrate a sustained period of timely payments 
as of december   previously modified loans totaling million were considered performing due to a sustained period of timely payments and therefore were accounted for on an accrual basis 
the million of performing troubled debt restructurings as of december  included an additional million in troubled debt restructurings identified upon retrospective adoption of the new accounting standard asu  a creditors determination of whether a restructuring is a trouble debt restructuring 
since adoption of the new standard was appropriately applied only to restructurings occurring on or after january   the december  troubled debt restructurings reflected in the above table do not include any potential troubled debt restructurings that may have been identified as a result of the new guidance 
management undertakes significant processes in order to identify potential problem loans in a timely manner 
in addition to regular interaction with the company s borrowers  the relationship managers review the credit ratings for each loan on a monthly basis and identify any potential downgrades 
for commercial  sba  and factoring and asset based lending loans  the company receives at minimum  annual financial statements and other pertinent reporting  such as borrowing bases for asset based facilities  so as to identify any deteriorating financial trends 
covenant compliance for these loans is also monitored on a quarterly basis 
for real estate construction and land loans  the development  construction and lease up or sell out status of each project is monitored on a monthly basis 
for loans secured by standing commercial or residential property  the company receives updated rent rolls and operating statements on an annual basis 
in addition  home equity loans are reviewed annually for deterioration in either the underlying property value or the borrower s payment history 
management also engages a third party loan review firm that reviews the loan portfolio every four months to further identify potential problem loans 
the loan review includes assessment of underwriting  quality of legal documents  management of the loan relationship  and adherence to the credit policy along with acceptable risk mitigation and rationale for exceptions to the policy 
as part of the loan approval process  management identifies the nature and type of underlying collateral supporting individual loans 
prior to or at the time of initial advances  any required lien positions are verified using ucc lien searches for personal property collateral  or title insurance for real property collateral 
the company engages a third party loan review firm to conduct an annual review of its loan documentation and the related policies and procedures regarding the loan documentation process 
the company primarily relies on fair market appraisals to determine the value of underlying collateral 
appraisals are required for real property secured loans of  or more  including increases to existing loans of  or more 
in the event there is evidence of deterioration in values  an evaluation of the collateral value and or a full new appraisal is required for an extension of the loan maturity 
potential problem loans are reappraised at a minimum of every months depending on current economic conditions 
the appraisals are performed by board approved appraisers that have appropriate licensing and experience 
when a prospective loan amount exceeds million  the completed appraisal is further reviewed by a qualified third party review appraiser 
to determine the value of underlying collateral for formula lines of credit that are predicated on a borrowing base of eligible assets  the company requires a pre loan funding field audit of the borrower s financial records to verify the accounts receivable  their eligibility for inclusion in the borrowing base  performance of the collateral and any asset concentrations 
on a monthly basis  relationship managers assess the collateral position of individual loans and identify any potential collateral shortfalls which  if left uncorrected  could result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan at some future date 
any potential collateral shortfalls are incorporated into a written corrective action plan 
the status of the correction action plans are reviewed by executive management 
review of ability to acquire additional collateral and the related timeframes are addressed on an individual loan basis 
at the time a loan is classified as substandard which includes any loans on non accrual  the company performs an impairment analysis of the collateral based on appraisals  field audits  other market value indicators  and management s judgment 
any shortfall between the collateral s realization value and the loan balance is charged off at that time 
impairment analyses are updated on a monthly basis 
additionally  as underlying collateral is reappraised the value of the collateral is reassessed and any additional charge off is taken at that time 
a similar practice is followed for downward adjustments to the company s oreo carrying value 
management is of the opinion that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate for known and unidentified losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  although the company is seeing a lower rate of inflow into problem assets generally  as well as a consistent reduction of carrying values through continued payments by borrowers on loans that have been placed on nonaccrual  should circumstances change and management determines that the collectiblity of any of these credits becomes unlikely  there could be an adverse effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses and the company s future profitability 
additionally  the company s construction  land  and other real estate loan portfolios  representing approximately of the total loan portfolio  could be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of non performing loans and other real estate owned and the level of the allowance for loan losses  which could also adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
funding deposits represent the bank s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
the bank s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
the following table summarizes the composition of deposits as of december   and as of december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market and savings certificates of deposit less than   and more total deposit portfolio deposits increased million or from million at december  to million at december  the increase in deposits was predominately in core deposit production which was primarily used to fund new loans and increase the investment portfolio 
leverage total gross loan balances at december  were million 
the resulting loan to deposit ratio was 
other earning assets at december  were primarily comprised of investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits of million 
to date  the company has deployed other earning assets primarily in federal funds sold to address the potential volatility of deposit balances and to accommodate projected loan funding  and in short term fixed rate investments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the company s asset sensitive balance sheet 
when deploying other earning assets  the company implements strategic decisions that may have a beneficial or adverse impact on net interest income and on the net interest margin to manage the business through a variety of economic cycles 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  as part of a strategic decision the company effectively repositioned the composition of its balance sheet and improved its liquidity position by deploying other earning assets primarily in federal funds in direct response to the recent economic downturn and potential volatility of the deposit portfolio 
beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout  the company  in addition to maintaining a consistent balance in federal funds  also deployed excess liquidity in additional investment securities to increase net interest income and support the net interest margin 
capital resources the company s capital resources consist of shareholders equity  trust preferred securities and for regulatory purposes the allowance for credit losses subject to limitations 
at december   the company s capital resources decreased million to million from million at december  tier capital decreased million to million at december   while tier capital increased by million during the same period  due solely to the increase in the allowance for credit losses 
the reduction in capital resources in was a result of the early redemption of series c preferred shares 
the company and the bank are subject to the capital guidelines and regulations governing capital adequacy for bank holding companies and national banks 
additional capital requirements may be imposed on banks based on market risk 
the fdic requires a leverage ratio of for new banks during the first three years of operation 
after the first three years of operations  the comptroller requires a minimum leverage ratio of for national banks that have received the highest composite regulatory rating a regulatory measurement of capital  assets  management  earnings and liquidity and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum 
the comptroller s regulations also require national banks to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets  including both on and off balance sheet exposures  which are multiplied by certain risk weights assigned by the comptroller to those assets 
at least one half of the qualifying capital must be in the form of tier capital 
the risk based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk  and might not take into account many other factors that can affect a bank s financial condition 
these factors include overall interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentrations of credit risk  certain risks arising from nontraditional activities  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks  including the risk presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities 
the comptroller has addressed many of these areas in related rule making proposals 
in addition to evaluating capital ratios  an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of each of these other factors including  in particular  the level and severity of problem and adversely classified assets 
for this reason  the final supervisory judgment on a bank s capital adequacy may differ significantly from the conclusions that might be drawn solely from the absolute level of the company s risk based capital ratio 
the comptroller has stated that banks generally are expected to operate above the minimum risk based capital ratio 
banks contemplating significant expansion plans  as well as those institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk  should hold capital consistent with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed 
further  the banking agencies have adopted modifications to the risk based capital regulations to include standards for interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from movements in interest rates 
while interest rate risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the company 
the banking agencies have addressed this problem by implementing changes to the capital standards to include a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates as a factor that the banking agencies consider in evaluating an institution s capital adequacy 
bank examiners consider a bank s historical financial performance and its earnings exposure to interest rate movements as well as qualitative factors such as the adequacy of a bank s internal interest rate risk management 
finally  institutions with significant trading activities must measure and hold capital for exposure to general market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and exposure to specific risk associated with debt and equity positions in the trading portfolio 
general market risk refers to changes in the market value of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items resulting from broad market movements 
specific market risk refers to changes in the market value of individual positions due to factors other than broad market movements and includes such risks as the credit risk of an instrument s issuer 
the additional capital requirements apply effective january  to institutions with trading assets and liabilities equal to or more of total assets or trading activity of billion or more 
the federal banking agencies may apply the market risk regulations on a case by case basis to institutions not meeting the eligibility criteria if necessary for safety and soundness reasons 
in connection with the recent regulatory attention to market risk and interest rate risk  the federal banking agencies will evaluate an institution in its periodic examination on the degree to which changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices can affect a financial institution s earnings or capital 
in addition  the agencies focus in the examination on an institution s ability to monitor and manage its market risk  and will provide management with a clearer and more focused indication of supervisory concerns in this area 
under certain circumstances  the comptroller may determine that the capital ratios for a national bank shall be maintained at levels  which are higher than the minimum levels required by the guidelines 
a national bank which does not achieve and maintain adequate capital levels as required may be subject to supervisory action by the comptroller through the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
in addition  the company is required to meet certain guidelines of the comptroller concerning the maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in response to increasing risk perceived in the economic environment  during the fourth quarter of the company raised million of additional capital

the company s tier capital at december  was million  which was comprised of million of capital stock and surplus  million in retained earnings and trust preferred securities up to the allowable limit of million 
the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the board of governors and the occ 
the company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least of assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings tier capital and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock or a limited amount of allowance for credit losses 
certain assets and commitments to extend credit present less risk than others and will be assigned to lower risk weighted categories requiring less capital allocation than the total ratio 
for example  cash and government securities are assigned to a risk weighted category  most home mortgage loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring a capital allocation and commercial loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring an capital allocation 
as of december   the company s and the bank s total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively for the company and for the bank at december

the fdicia requires the bank regulatory authorities to initiate corrective action regarding financial institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
such action may result in orders to  among other matters  augment capital and reduce total assets 
critically undercapitalized financial institutions may also be subject to appointment of a receiver or implementation of a capitalization plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity interest rate sensitivity the company strives to manage its liquidity to provide adequate funds at an acceptable cost to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flows of its customers 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the company is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
the company strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
at december   liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were as compared to in in addition to cash and due from banks  liquid assets include interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  and unpledged securities available for sale 
the company has million in federal funds lines of credit available with correspondent banks to meet liquidity needs 
at december   there were no balances outstanding on these lines 
additionally  as of december   the company had a total borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of san francisco of approximately million for which the company had collateral in place to borrow million 
as of december   million of this borrowing capacity was pledged to secure a letter of credit 
the company s balance sheet position is asset sensitive based upon the significant amount of variable rate loans and the repricing characteristics of its deposit accounts 
this balance sheet position generally provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of interest rate decreases 
net interest income is generally negatively impacted in the short term by a decline in interest rates 
conversely  an increase in interest rates should have a short term positive impact on net interest income 
management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity continue to be appropriate 
the bank utilizes a monthly gap report as well as a quarterly simulation model to identify interest rate sensitivity over the short and long term 
management considers the results of these analyses when implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities  based on contractual terms  of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie interest rate gap divided by interest rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio

that is  at december  the volume of assets that might reprice within the next year exceeded the volume of liabilities that might reprice 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of rate decreases 
net interest income is negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates and positively impacted by an increase in interest rates 
to partially mitigate the adverse impact of declining rates  the majority of variable rate loans made by the bank have been written with a minimum floor rate
