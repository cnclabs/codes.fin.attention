overview our clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine in the following indications acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  in the elderly  myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  and non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have ongoing clinical programs in development awaiting further data 
once data becomes available and is reviewed  we will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and or partnering these assets  including sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib and seliciclib in nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancer  or npc 
in addition  we market directly in the united states xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we have generated several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk  inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors and plk inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trial in aml and in phase for mds and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
our resources are primarily directed towards advancing our lead drug candidate sapacitabine through in house development activities although we are also progressing our earlier stage novel drug series through working with external collaborators but with limited investment by us 
research and development expenditures for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were reduced by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  
table of contents we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine and seliciclib and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with a research facility located in dundee  scotland 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre clinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  registered direct financings  licensing revenue  collaborations  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have recognized revenues from inception through december   totaling million  of which million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements  million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards  and million from product sales 
we have also recognized million in research and development tax credits  which are reported as income tax benefits on the consolidated statements of operations  from the united kingdom s tax authority  hm revenue customs since inception 
recent events purchase agreement on march   we entered into a purchase agreement with certain existing institutional stockholders  raising million of proceeds  net of certain fees and expenses 
the proceeds from the financing will be used to fund ongoing litigation related expenses on certain intellectual property and for general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the investors purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of  which is equal to the day average closing price of our common stock for the period ending on wednesday  march  in addition to the common stock  investors received contractual rights to receive in cash of any future litigation settlement on certain intellectual property  subject to a cap  or alternatively  in lieu of a cash payment  either warrants to purchase common stock in certain situations or additional shares as part of any settlement in a possible related  alternative transaction 
the shares issued at closing are subject to a lock up period of one year from the date of issuance 
nasdaq appeal as previously reported  on september   we received a letter from the nasdaq stating that for consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock had closed below per share  the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements set forth in listing rule a  or the rule  and that  pursuant to listing rule c a  we have calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on march   we received a determination letter from nasdaq notifying us that we had not regained compliance with the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements set forth in listing rule a  or the rule  during the calendar days allowed to regain compliance pursuant to listing rule c a  and that our security is subject to delisting from the nasdaq 
table of contents global market  unless the we timely request a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel  or the panel 
we have requested a hearing before the panel to present our plan to regain compliance with the rule  which request automatically stays the delisting of our securities pending the issuance of the panel s decision 
the hearing is scheduled for april  under nasdaq s listing rules  the panel may  at its discretion  determine to continue our listing pursuant to an exception to the rule for a maximum of calendar days from the date of the nasdaq staff s notification  or through september  however  there can be no assurances that the panel will do so 
notwithstanding our request for a hearing before the panel  if such appeal is unsuccessful  we may still transfer our listing to the nasdaq capital market if it meets the initial listing criteria set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule  except for the bid price requirement 
in that case  we may have an additional period of calendar days in which to comply with the minimum bid price requirement 
we currently meet these initial listing criteria  except for the bid price requirement

revenues the following table summarizes the components of our revenues for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands collaboration and research and development revenue product revenue grant revenue total revenue we recognized million of collaboration and research and development revenue for the year ended december   derived from an agreement with a pharmaceutical company under which we provided one of our compounds for evaluation in the field of eye care 
we had no collaboration and research and development revenue for the years ended december  and product revenue is derived from the sale of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million  and million in revenues  respectively 
the increase in product revenue for the year ended december  versus that in the prior year was mostly due to product returns approximating million for the year ended december   related to expiring products with a two year shelf life previously sold into the marketplace 
grant revenue is recognized as we incur and pay for qualifying costs and services under the applicable grant 
grant revenue is primarily derived from various united kingdom government and european union grant awards 
for the years ended december  and  we had grant revenue of  and  respectively 
we did not recognize any grant revenue for the year ended 
table of contents december   as our last grant was finalized in and no additional grants have been received since that time 
the future we expect to continue to maintain the sales of align products with the support of a small sales and marketing infrastructure 
we do not expect grant revenue to increase meaningfully over the next months 
cost of goods sold years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes the cost of align products that have been delivered to our customers and for which revenues have been recognized 
we recognized cost of goods sold of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction in the cost of sales for the year ended december   was mostly due to lower product revenues partially offset by million of write offs of expiring product during the year ended december  the reduction in cost of sales for the year ended december   was mostly the result of higher cost of goods recognized for the year ended december   due to write offs of expiring product 
total cost of goods sold represented  and of product revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the future  we expect to maintain a margin level in the range of what we incurred in research and development expenses from our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents and our research and development expenses have represented costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including clinical trial costs for sapacitabine  seliciclib  and sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib 
we have also incurred costs in the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and pre clinical trials and the development of in house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial and regulatory related costs  payroll and personnel related expenses  including consultants and contract research  preclinical studies and laboratory supplies and materials  technology license costs  and rent and facility expenses for our laboratories 
the following table provides information with respect to our research and development expenditures for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands sapacitabine seliciclib other costs related to research and development programs  management and exploratory research total research and development expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in research and development expenses is stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs of million is primarily due to a million increase in sapacitabine related costs and a million decrease in other research and development costs  respectively  as we continue to focus on the development of sapacitabine 
the million increase in sapacitabine expenditures was primarily due to million of contractual expenses  resulting from an achievement of a milestone triggered by the opening of enrollment in our seamless trial  pursuant to the daiichi sankyo license under which we license certain patent rights for sapacitabine  a million increase related to clinical trial supplies  and a million increase in clinical trial expenses 
seliciclib costs increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   primarily due to the cost of analyzing patient samples from the appraise study 
other research and development costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as we have concentrated financial resources on the development of sapacitabine and reduced investment in other compounds 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  approximately million was due to closing out of all programs other than sapacitabine 
research and development costs associated with the sapacitabine program decreased by million due largely to capsule manufacture costs incurred in that were not necessary in the future we will continue to concentrate our resources on the development of sapacitabine 
we anticipate that overall research and development expenditures in will increase as we continue enroll the randomized portion seamless pivotal phase trial 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include costs for sales and marketing operations  administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the total selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional and consultancy costs of million  a decrease in stock based compensation of million  a decrease in salaries of million  and a decrease in rent of million as a result of the expiration of our lease on a facility in bothell  washington in december these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in patent related costs  and a million increase in board of directors expenses  mostly due to the addition of two new board members during the year ended december  fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to increased consultancy and professional costs of million  an increase in stock based compensation costs of million  and an increase in legal costs of million 
this was partially offset by reductions in employment related costs of million and intellectual property costs of million 
the future we expect our selling  general and administrative expenditures in to remain at the same level or to be less than our expenditures in other restructuring costs the following table summarizes the restructuring charges for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total restructuring charge fiscal as compared to fiscal there was no restructuring charge for the years ended december  and fiscal as compared to fiscal there was no restructuring charge for the year ended december   as compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  during  we reduced our workforce by people as part of a revision of our operating plan to concentrate our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine 
the future revisions to our operating plan  if any  will be assessed as circumstances dictate 

table of contents other income expense the following table summarizes the other income for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands payment under guarantee change in valuation of derivative change in valuation of warrants liability amendment to ceff warrants foreign exchange gain loss interest income interest expense total other income expense  net fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income expense  net  increased by million  from an expense of million for the year ended december   to income of million for the year ended december   mainly due the million increase in the change in the valuation of the warrant liability  mostly due to the decrease in our common share price from at december  to at december  change in valuation of derivative the change in valuation of derivative relates to an agreement with scottish enterprise that would require us to make a payment of up to million if our operations in scotland fall below minimum staffing levels 
this arrangement is accounted for as a liability and is measured at fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
due to the nature of the associated contingency and the likelihood of occurrence  we have concluded the fair value of this liability was approximately  at december  for the year ended december   we recognized a loss from the change in the valuation of derivative of approximately  there was no liability recorded at december  and no change in valuation of derivative for the year ended december  change in valuation of warrants liability the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors are classified as and are being accounted for as a liability 
the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercise or expiration 
for the year ended december   we recognized income from the change in the value of warrants of million and for the year ended december   we recognized an expense of million 
foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange gains losses not related to intercompany loans are recorded in income expense 
foreign exchange gain loss was a  expense for the year ended december   compared to a  expense for the year ended december  
table of contents the intercompany loans outstanding are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the nature of the funding advanced is of a long term investment nature 
therefore all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements related to intercompany loans recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income interest income increased by  from  for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december  this is mostly attributed to a higher average daily balance of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  interest expense interest expense was  for year ended december  we did not record any interest expense for the year ended december  this reduction was due to the elimination of the accretion expense associated with the restructured bothell lease  which expired in december fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income expense  net  decreased by million from an expense of million in  to income of million in  mainly due the million expense for the payment to the scottish enterprise in and  to a lesser extent  the reduction in interest income of million arising from lower yields available on lower average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents and million in interest expense 
the differences related to these items are explained further below 
change in valuation of warrants liability the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors are classified as and are being accounted for as a liability 
the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercised or expiration 
for each of the years ended december  and  we recognized an expense of million in the change in the value of warrants 
foreign exchange gain loss in conjunction with the operational review conducted by us in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october   intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october   all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
for the year ended december   unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements related to intercompany loans recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million compared to favorable unrealized foreign exchange movements of million for the year ended december  foreign exchange gains losses not related to intercompany loans are recorded in income expense 
foreign exchange gain loss was a  expense for the year ended december   compared to a  expense for the year ended december  
table of contents interest income interest income decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during  maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  being a more secure form of investment and providing greater liquidity 
as a result  these assets attracted a lower rate of interest 
this was compounded by a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to interest expense interest expense decreased by  from  for year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this is due largely to the reduction in accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease  which expired in december for each of the years ended december  and  we recorded accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease of  and  respectively 
the future the valuation of the warrants liability and derivative will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the warrants is dependent upon many factors  including our stock price  interest rates and the remaining term of the instrument and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
the valuation of derivative is dependent on a number of factors  including our stock price and management judgment of the probability of the occurrence of certain events that would give rise to a contingency 
we do not expect the valuation of derivative to fluctuate significantly 
as the nature of funding advanced through intercompany loans is that of a long term investment in nature  future unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
this will minimize the future impact of unrealized foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings 
income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred 
the following table summarizes research and development tax credits for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total income tax benefit fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but is restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease is a consequence of the lower eligible payroll expenses in the united kingdom 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or million  from million for the year ended  to million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and 
table of contents development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease is a consequence of the lower eligible payroll expenses in the united kingdom following the workforce reductions commenced in september and continued in the future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future but expect the income tax benefit to increase for the year ended december  due to changes in the united kingdom tax rules 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as at december  and december  december  difference difference in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital current assets current liabilities total working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to normal cash outflows required to operate our business  offset by net proceeds of million from the july underwritten offering 
current liabilities were million at both december  and accrued and other current liabilities increased million  offset by a million decrease in warrants and other derivatives 
since our inception  we have not generated any significant product revenues and have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of common and preferred equity securities  as well as the exercise of warrants  to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from operations and recent financing activities are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  we do not currently have sufficient funds to complete commercialization of any of our drug candidates 
current business and capital market risks could have a detrimental effect on the availability of sources of funding and our ability to access them in the future which may delay or impede our progress of advancing our drugs currently in the clinical pipeline to approval by the fda for commercialization 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities 
table of contents year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities net cash used in operating activities decreased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from our net loss of million  adjusted for material non cash activities comprising of change in valuation of liability classified warrants  depreciation  unrealized foreign exchange losses and stock based compensation expense amounting to million and a net increase of million due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a net increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities increased by million  to million in from million in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december   of million resulted primarily from our net loss of million  adjusted for material non cash activities comprising of change in valuation of liability classified warrants  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation expense amounting to million and a net reduction of million due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a net decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities decreased  from and inflow of  for the the year ended december  to an outflow of  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities amounted to million  primarily due to cash proceeds from the redemption of short term securities of million 
capital expenditures have remained low as the company has continued to focus on the clinical development of sapacitabine 
capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  from a source of million for the year ended december   to a source of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities was lower than in the previous year primarily due to the completion of a private placement of million in net proceeds during october  the two registered direct offerings in january for net proceeds of million  the issuance of million shares of common stock for million as part of the committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge and the exercise of options and warrants totaling million during  as compared to the completion of an underwritten offering in july for net proceeds of million and payment of a preferred stock dividend of million 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the completion of a private placement of million in net proceeds during october  the two registered direct offerings in january for net proceeds of million  the issuance of million shares of common stock for million as part of the ceff with kingsbridge and the exercise of options and warrants totaling million during during the year ended december   we received net proceeds of million from a registered direct financing and we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to kingsbridge under the terms of the ceff in consideration of an aggregate of million 

table of contents operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
while we have generated modest product revenues from align product sales for the years ended december   and  we cannot guarantee that we will generate any significant product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks  the current economic climate has also impacted the availability of funds and activity in equity markets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan 
in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we have adopted the following revenue recognition policy related to the sales of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
we recognize revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we offer a general right of return on these product sales and account for all product sales using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue is not recognized upon shipment of product to distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price less of the current wholesale acquisition price in accordance with our returns policy and deferred cost of sales at the cost at which those goods were held in inventory 
we recognize revenue when such inventory is sold through to pharmacies 
to estimate product sold through to pharmacies  we rely on third party information  including information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to pharmacies 
we also record against revenue a provision for product returns which is calculated based on the historical return rate for each product 
for  we recorded million of product returns due to a higher than anticipated amount of returns 
since the first quarter of  our supplier has increased the product shelf life of xclair cream from two to three years to assist us in the management of the product supply chain 
numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges have product shelf lives of three and five years  respectively 
collaboration  research and development  and grant revenue certain of our revenues are earned from collaborative agreements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the research performed  the substance of the milestones met relative to those we must still perform  and the collectability of any related fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities  are recorded as the related services are performed 
milestone payments are non refundable and recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
grant revenues from government agencies and private research foundations are recognized as the related qualified research and development costs are incurred  up to the limit of the prior approved funding amounts 
grant revenues are not refundable 
stock based compensation we grant stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to officers  employees  directors and consultants under the company s amended and restated equity incentive plan  which was amended and restated as of april  we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of grant date fair value for stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the 
table of contents expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
the fair value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
we recognized income of million  an expense of million and an expense of approximately  for the years ended december   and  respectively  as a result of changes in forfeiture estimates 
warrants liability february financing the accounting guidance on derivatives and jedging requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as equity instruments  assets or liabilities 
under the provisions of this guidance  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
since we are unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded an expense of million and income of million to reflect the change in fair value for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors
