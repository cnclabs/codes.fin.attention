table of contents we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure  is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to ebitda for the years ended december     and year ended december  dollars in thousands net income depreciation amortization of net lease premiums discounts and lease incentives interest  net income tax provision earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes ebitda management believes that adjusted net income ani when viewed in conjunction with the company s results under us gaap and the below reconciliation  provide useful information about operating and period over period performance and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business without regard to periodic reporting elements related to interest rate derivative accounting and gains or losses related to flight equipment and debt investments

overview we are a global company that acquires  leases  and sells high utility commercial jet aircraft to passenger and cargo airlines throughout the world 
high utility aircraft are generally modern  operationally efficient jets with a large operator base and long useful lives 
as of december   our aircraft portfolio consisted of aircraft that were leased to lessees located in countries  and managed through our offices in the united states  ireland and singapore 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
from time to time  we also make investments in other aviation assets  including debt investments secured by commercial jet aircraft 
our revenues and income from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  and for the fourth quarter were million and million  respectively 
revenues our revenues are comprised primarily of operating lease rentals on flight equipment held for lease  revenue from retained maintenance payments related to lease expirations and lease termination payments and lease incentive amortization 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain 
table of contents high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon their completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated cost of the maintenance event and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of depreciation of flight equipment held for lease  interest expense  selling  general and administrative expenses  aircraft impairment charges and maintenance and other costs 
because our operating lease terms generally require the lessee to pay for operating  maintenance and insurance costs  our portion of maintenance and other costs relating to aircraft reflected in our statement of income primarily relates to expenses for unscheduled lease terminations 
income tax provision we have obtained an assurance from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act that  in the event that any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax shall not  until march  be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares  debentures or other obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or to any taxes payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
consequently  the provision for income taxes recorded relates to income earned by certain subsidiaries of the company which are located in  or earn income in  jurisdictions that impose income taxes  primarily ireland and the united states 
all of our aircraft owning subsidiaries that are recognized as corporations for us tax purposes are us corporations 
these non us subsidiaries generally earn income from sources outside the united states and typically are not subject to us federal  state or local income taxes unless they operate within the us  in 
table of contents which case they may be subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
we also have a u 
s based subsidiary which provides management services to our non us subsidiaries and is subject to non us federal  state and local income taxes 
in addition  those subsidiaries that are resident in ireland are subject to irish tax

finance historically  our debt financing arrangements typically have been secured by aircraft and related operating leases  and in the case of our securitizations and pooled aircraft term financings  the financing parties have limited recourse to aircastle limited 
while such financings have historically been available on reasonable terms given the loan to value profile we have pursued  current market conditions continue to limit the availability of both debt and equity capital 
though financing market conditions have recovered recently and we expect them to continue to improve in time  current market conditions remain difficult with respect to financing mid age  current technology aircraft 
in  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due at a premium with yield to worst and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
in addition  we secured million in bank financing for three aircraft we acquired during the fourth quarter of during the near term  we intend to 
table of contents focus our efforts on investment opportunities that are attractive on an unleveraged basis  that tap commercial financial capacity where it is accessible on reasonable terms or for which debt financing that benefits from government guarantees either from the ecas or from exim is available 
we intend to fund new investments through cash on hand and potentially through medium to longer term financings on a secured or unsecured basis 
we may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long term debt financings  additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations and asset sales 
therefore  our ability to execute our business strategy  particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets  depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive

we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
we performed this recoverability assessment during the third quarter of management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability assessment based on its knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and other factors 
while we believe that the estimates and related assumptions used in the recoverability assessment are appropriate  actual results could differ from those estimates 
other than the aircraft discussed above  management believes that the net book value of each aircraft is currently supported by the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that aircraft  and accordingly  no other aircraft were impaired as a consequence of this recoverability assessment 
following our recently completed aircraft recoverability assessment  we changed our economic life assumptions or residual values  or both  for certain aircraft types to reflect changes in market conditions 
more specifically  for airbus a aircraft we shortened our economic useful life assumption from years to years resulting from what we believe to be a long term reduction in demand for this lower capacity variant of the a family of aircraft 
for classic and less fuel efficient narrow body aircraft consisting of boeing model and aircraft as well as airbus a aircraft with previous generation engines  we reduced our end of life residual value assumptions to reflect weaker market demand and lease rate conditions 
as a result of these changes to our estimates  we expect our future annual depreciation expense for the aircraft noted above will be million higher in total than our previous estimates 
at december   we had a total of aircraft  including those aircraft mentioned in the preceding paragraph  with a total net book value of million accounting for of the total net book value of our flight equipment held for lease  that we consider more susceptible to failing our recoverability assessment 
the recoverability in the value of these aircraft is more sensitive to changes in contractual cash flows  future cash flow estimates and aircraft residual or scrap values 
these aircraft fall primarily into a few categories as shown in the table below aircraft type number of aircraft percent of net book value a a er other md f we see continued demand for boeing model er aircraft  but we also anticipate a greater probability that lease rates will soften in time as a result of the continuing success of the airbus a program and as production of the boeing production eventually ramps up 
as such  we believe demand for these aircraft will become more sensitive to changes in economic conditions 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and currently available information 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most subjective judgments  estimates and assumptions 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
lease revenue recognition our operating lease rentals are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we will neither recognize revenue nor record a receivable from a customer when collectability is not reasonably assured 
estimating whether collectability is reasonably assured requires some level of subjectivity and judgment 
when collectability is not reasonably assured  the customer is placed on non accrual status and revenue is recognized when cash payments are received 
management determines whether customers should be placed on non accrual status 
when we are reasonably assured that payments will be received in a timely manner  the customer is placed on accrual status 
the accrual non accrual status of a customer is maintained at a level deemed appropriate based on factors such as the customer s credit rating  payment performance  financial condition and requests for modifications of lease terms and conditions 
events or circumstances outside of historical customer patterns can also result in changes to a customer s accrual status 
maintenance payments and maintenance revenue under our leases  the lessee must pay operating expenses accrued or payable during the term of the lease  which would normally include maintenance  overhaul  fuel  crew  landing  airport and navigation charges  certain taxes  licenses  consents and approvals  aircraft registration  and insurance premiums 
typically  our aircraft are subject to net operating leases whereby the lessee pays lease rentals and is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational  maintenance and insurance costs  although in a majority of cases  we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs 
our aircraft lease agreements generally provide for the periodic payment of a fixed amount of rent over the life of the lease  and the amount of the contracted rent will depend upon the type  age  specification and condition of the aircraft and market conditions at the time the lease is committed 
the amount of rent we receive will depend on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of our lessees and the occurrence of delinquencies  restructurings and defaults 
our lease rental revenues are also affected by the extent to which aircraft are off lease and our ability to remarket aircraft that are nearing the end of their leases in order to minimize their off lease time 
our success in re leasing aircraft is affected by market conditions relating to our aircraft and by general industry conditions and trends 
an increase in the percentage of off lease aircraft or a reduction in lease rates upon remarketing would negatively impact our revenues 
under an operating lease  the lessee will be responsible for performing maintenance on the relevant aircraft and will typically be required to make payments to us for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components of the aircraft 
these maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time  depending upon the component  and would be made either monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term 
for maintenance payments made monthly in arrears during a lease term  we will typically be required to reimburse all or a portion of these payments to the lessee upon completion of the relevant heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
we record maintenance payments paid by the lessee during a lease as accrued maintenance liabilities in recognition of our obligation in the lease to refund such payments  and therefore we do not recognize maintenance revenue during the lease 
maintenance revenue recognition would 
table of contents occur at the end of a lease  when we are able to determine the amount  if any  by which reserve payments received exceed the amount we are required under the lease to reimburse to the lessee for heavy maintenance  overhaul or parts replacement 
the amount of maintenance revenue we recognize in any reporting period is inherently volatile and is dependent upon a number of factors  including the timing of lease expiries  including scheduled and unscheduled expiries  the timing of maintenance events and the utilization of the aircraft by the lessee 
lease incentives and amortization many of our leases contain provisions which may require us to pay a portion of the lessee s costs for heavy maintenance  overhaul or replacement of certain high value components 
we account for these expected payments as lease incentives  which are amortized as a reduction of revenue over the life of the lease 
we estimate the amount of our portion for such costs  typically for the first major maintenance event for the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power units  expected to be paid to the lessee based on assumed utilization of the related aircraft by the lessee  the anticipated cost of the maintenance event and the estimated amounts the lessee is responsible to pay 
this estimated lease incentive is not recognized as a lease incentive liability at the inception of the lease 
we recognize the lease incentive as a reduction of lease revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  with the offset being recorded as a lease incentive liability  which is included in maintenance payments on the balance sheet 
the payment to the lessee for the lease incentive liability is first recorded against the lease incentive liability  and any excess above the lease incentive liability is recorded as a prepaid lease incentive asset  which is included in other assets on the balance sheet and continues to amortize over the remaining life of the lease 
flight equipment held for lease and depreciation flight equipment held for lease is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  typically over a year life from the date of manufacture for passenger aircraft and over a to year life for freighter aircraft  depending on whether the aircraft is a converted or purpose built freighter  to estimated residual values 
estimated residual values are generally determined to be approximately of the manufacturer s estimated realized price for passenger aircraft when new and for freighter aircraft when new 
management may make exceptions to this policy on a case by case basis when  in its judgment  the residual value calculated pursuant to this policy does not appear to reflect current expectations of value 
examples of situations where exceptions may arise include but are not limited to flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturer s realized sales prices are not relevant eg  freighter conversions  flight equipment where estimates of the manufacturers realized sales prices are not readily available  and flight equipment which may have a shorter useful life due to obsolescence 
in accounting for flight equipment held for lease  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  the fair value of attached leases  acquired maintenance liabilities and the estimated residual values 
in making these estimates  we rely upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
as part of our due diligence review of each aircraft we purchase  we prepare an estimate of the expected maintenance payments and any excess costs which may become payable by us  taking into consideration the then current maintenance status of the aircraft and the relevant provisions of any existing lease 
for planned major maintenance activities for aircraft off lease  the company capitalizes the actual maintenance costs by applying the deferral method 
under the deferral method  we capitalize the actual cost of major maintenance events  which are depreciated on a straight line basis over the period until the next maintenance event is required 

table of contents when we acquire an aircraft with a lease  determining the fair value of the attached lease requires us to make assumptions regarding the current fair values of leases for specific aircraft 
we estimate a range of current lease rates of like aircraft in order to determine if the attached lease is within a fair value range 
if a lease is below or above the range of current lease rates  we present value the estimated amount below or above fair value range over the remaining term of the lease 
the resulting lease discount or premium is amortized into lease rental income over the remaining term of the lease 
impairment of flight equipment we perform a recoverability assessment of all aircraft in our fleet  on an aircraft by aircraft basis  at least annually 
in addition  a recoverability assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances  or indicators  indicate that the carrying amount or net book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators may include  but are not limited to  a significant lease restructuring or early lease termination  significant air traffic decline  the introduction of newer technology aircraft or engines  an aircraft type is no longer in production or a significant airworthiness directive is issued 
when we perform a recoverability assessment  we measure whether the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the aircraft exceed its net book value 
the undiscounted cash flows consist of cash flows from currently contracted leases  future projected lease rates  transition costs  estimated down time and estimated residual or scrap values for an aircraft 
in the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test  the aircraft will be adjusted to fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
see further discussion under fair value measurements below 
management develops the assumptions used in the recoverability analysis based on its knowledge of active lease contracts  current and future expectations of the global demand for a particular aircraft type and historical experience in the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry  as well as information received from third party industry sources 
the factors considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows are impacted by changes in future periods due to changes in contracted lease rates  residual values  economic conditions  technology  airline demand for a particular aircraft type and many of the risk factors discussed in item a 
risk factors 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business we utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
all interest rate derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we determine fair value for our united states dollar denominated interest rate derivatives by calculating reset rates and discounting cash flows based on cash rates  futures rates and swap rates in effect at the period close 
we determine the fair value of our united states dollar denominated guaranteed notional balance interest rate derivatives based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close 
the changes in fair values related to the effective portion of the interest rate derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the ineffective portion of the interest rate derivative is calculated and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income at each quarter end 
for any interest rate derivatives not designated as a hedge  all mark to market adjustments are recognized in other income expense on our consolidated statement of income 
at inception of the hedge  we choose a method to assess effectiveness and to calculate ineffectiveness  which we must use for the life of the hedge relationship 
historically  we have designated the change in variable cash flows method for calculation of hedge ineffectiveness 
this methodology  which is only available for interest rate derivatives designated at execution with a fair value of zero  involves a comparison of the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the interest rate derivative against the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
when the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg exceeds the change in the liability  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
effectiveness is tested by dividing the change in the interest rate derivative s variable leg by the change in the liability 

table of contents we used the hypothetical trade method for hedge relationships designated after execution because those hedge relationships did not have an interest rate derivative fair value of zero  and therefore  did not qualify for the change in variable cash flow method 
the hypothetical trade method involves a comparison of the change in the fair value of an actual interest rate derivative to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical interest rate derivative with critical terms that reflect the hedged debt 
when the change in the value of the interest rate derivative exceeds the change in the hypothetical interest rate derivative  the calculated ineffectiveness is recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statement of income 
the effectiveness of these relationships is tested by regressing historical changes in the interest rate derivative against historical changes in the hypothetical interest rate derivative 
fair value measurements we measure the fair value of interest rate derivative assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level maximizes the use of observable inputs  including contractual terms  interest rate curves  cash rates and futures rates and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs  including an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we use our interest rate derivative counterparty s valuation of our interest rate derivatives to validate our models 
our interest rate derivatives are sensitive to market changes in libor as discussed in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our valuation model for interest rate derivatives classified in level includes a significant unobservable market input to value the option component of the guaranteed notional balance 
the guaranteed notional balance has an upper notional band that matches the hedged debt on term financing no 
and a lower notional band 
the notional balance is guaranteed to match the hedged debt balance if the debt balances decrease within the upper and lower notional band 
the range of the guaranteed notional between the upper and lower band represents an option that may not be exercised independently of the debt notional balance 
the fair value of the interest rate derivative is determined based on the upper notional band using cash flows discounted at the relevant market interest rates in effect at the period close and incorporates an assessment of the risk of non performance by the interest rate derivative counterparty in valuing derivative assets  an evaluation of the company s credit risk in valuing derivative liabilities and an assessment of market risk in valuing the derivative asset or liability 
we also measure the fair value of aircraft on a non recurring basis when us gaap requires the application of fair value  including events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts of aircraft may not be recoverable 
we principally use the income approach to measure the fair value of these assets 
the income approach is based on the present value of cash flows from contractual lease agreements and projected future lease payments  net of expenses  which extend to the end of the aircraft s economic life in its highest and best use configuration  as well as a disposal value based on expectations of market participants 
income taxes aircastle uses an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount estimated by us to be realizable 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents recent unadopted accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft  leases the lease ed  which would replace the existing guidance in the accounting standards codification asc asc  leases 
under the lease ed  a lessor would be required to adopt a right of use model where the lessor would apply one of two approaches to each lease based on whether the lessor retains exposure to significant risks or benefits associated with the underlying asset 
in july  the fasb tentatively decided on a new model for lessor accounting that would require a single approach for all leases  with a few exceptions 
under the new model  a lease receivable would be recognized for the lessor s right to receive lease payments  a portion of the carrying amount of the underlying asset would be allocated between the right of use granted to the lessee and the lessor s residual value and profit or loss would only be recognized at commencement if it is reasonably assured 
even though the fasb has not completed all of its deliberations  the decisions made to date were sufficiently different from those published in the lease ed issued in august as a result  the fasb decided to re expose the ed in the first half of we anticipate that the final standard may have an effective date no earlier than when and if the proposed guidance becomes effective  it may have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
although we believe the presentation of our financial statements  and those of our lessees could change  we do not believe the accounting pronouncement will change the fundamental economic reasons for which the airlines lease aircraft 
therefore  we do not believe it will have a material impact on our business 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this update change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements which include those that clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements  and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurement 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which was adopted by the company effective december  in october  the fasb proposed a partial deferral of the new requirement 
this proposal was then finalized in december in asu asu comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
this asu defers the asu requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in both net income and other comprehensive income oci on the face of the financial statements 
during the deferral period  there is no requirement to separately present or disclose the reclassification adjustments into net income 
this deferral  however  does not change the requirement to present items of net income  other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in either a single continuous or two consecutive statements 
reclassifications out of aoci are to be presented either on the face of the financial statement in which oci is presented or it can be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the fasb expects to complete a project to reconsider the presentation requirement for reclassification adjustments in the deferral allows the fasb time to further research the matter 
the effective date of asu is consistent with the effective date of asu which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity currently are cash on hand  cash generated by our aircraft leasing operations  loans secured by new aircraft we acquire and unsecured borrowings 
our business is very capital intensive  requiring significant investments in order to expand our fleet during periods of growth and investments in maintenance and improvements on our existing portfolio 
our business also generates a significant amount of cash from operations  primarily from lease rentals and maintenance collections 
these sources have historically provided liquidity for these investments and for other uses  including the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
in the past  we have also met our liquidity and capital resource needs by utilizing several sources  including lines of credit  our securitizations  term financings  secured borrowings supported by export credit agencies for new aircraft acquisitions and bank financings secured by aircraft purchases  unsecured indebtedness  including an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes  public offerings of common shares  and asset sales 
going forward  we expect to continue to seek liquidity from these sources subject to pricing and conditions that we consider satisfactory 
in addition  we have a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with citigroup global markets inc  which has a three year term scheduled to expire in september  we have not yet drawn down on this facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we secured financing in the form of bank term loans in the aggregate amount of million in connection with the purchase of a boeing model er aircraft and two md f freighter aircraft 
also  in december  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due at a premium with yield to worst and used the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of aviation assets 
under the terms of securitization no 
effective june   all cash flows available after expenses and interest are applied to debt amortization

 effective june  all cash flows available after expenses and interest will be applied to debt amortization 
we expect that debt amortization payments  excluding repayments from asset sales  over the next twelve months will be approximately million  excluding debt repayments from asset sales of million  compared to million  excluding debt repayments from asset sales of million  made over the twelve months ended december  further  for this financing  we recently entered into a forward starting interest rate swap arrangement to hedge approximately of the expected future debt balance beginning in june at an average rate of  which is approximately basis points lower than the existing swap which expires in june the net book value of our flight equipment held for lease unencumbered by financings has grown to million as of december  we believe the cash flow contribution for this asset base  together with the cash flow contribution from our delivered new a aircraft and from term financing no 
 will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to meet our liquidity needs and near term growth objectives 
while the financing structures for our securitizations and certain of our term financings include liquidity facilities  these liquidity facilities are primarily designed to provide short term liquidity to enable the financing vehicles to remain current on interest payments during periods when the relevant entities incur substantial unanticipated expenditures 
because these facilities have priority in the payment waterfall and therefore must be repaid quickly  and because we do not anticipate being required to draw on these facilities to cover operating expenses  we do not view these liquidity facilities as an important source of liquidity for us 

table of contents as of december   we are in compliance with all applicable covenants in our financings 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares 
at december   we repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of million including commissions  completing the share repurchases to the authorized amounts 
in addition  as of december   we expect capital expenditures and lessee maintenance payment draws on our aircraft portfolio during to be approximately million to million  excluding purchase obligation payments and freighter conversion payments  and we expect maintenance collections from lessees on our owned aircraft portfolio to be approximately million to million over the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance that the capital expenditures  our contributions to maintenance events and lessee maintenance payment draws described above will not be greater than expected or that our expected maintenance payment collections or disbursements will equal our current estimates 
we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations  maintenance payments received from lessees  and proceeds from any future contracted aircraft sales will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months 
our liquidity and capital resource needs include  payments due under our other aircraft purchase commitments  required principal and interest payments under our long term debt facilities  expected capital expenditures  lessee maintenance payment draws and lease incentive payments over the next twelve months

there is no ratings threshold for the liquidity facility provider under term financing no 
 and  accordingly  the ratings change referred to in footnote above did not trigger a liquidity facility drawing in relation to term financing no 
the purpose of these facilities is to provide liquidity for the relevant securitization or term financing in the event that cash flow from lease contracts and other revenue sources is not sufficient to pay operating expenses with respect to the relevant aircraft portfolio  interest payments and interest rate hedging payments for the relevant securitization or term debt financings 
these liquidity facilities are generally day commitments of the liquidity provider and may be extended prior to expiry 
if a facility is not extended  or in certain circumstances if the short term credit rating of the liquidity provider is downgraded  the relevant securitization or term financing documents require that the liquidity facility is drawn and the proceeds of the drawing placed on deposit so that such amounts may be available  if needed  to provide liquidity advances for the relevant securitization or term financing

if the debt service coverage ratio requirements are not met on two consecutive monthly payment dates  all excess cash flows will thereafter be applied to prepay the principal balance of the loans until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds the minimum level 
compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the appraised value of the aircraft securing term financing no 
and the timely receipt of lease payments from their lessees 
we refer to any prepayments of principal following noncompliance with the loan to value or debt service coverage ratios as supplemental principal payments 
a maintenance adjusted appraisal of term financing no 
portfolio must be completed each year  before a date in early may by a specified appraiser 
to determine the maintenance adjusted values  the appraiser applies upward or downward adjustments of its half life current market values for the aircraft in the term financing no 
portfolio based upon the maintenance status of the airframe  engines  landing gear and auxiliary power unit apu and applies certain other upward or downward adjustments for equipment and capabilities and for utilization 
compliance with the loan to value ratio is measured each month by comparing the minimum ratio against the most recently completed maintenance adjusted appraised value  less for each month since such appraisal was provided to the lenders  plus of the cash maintenance reserve balance held on deposit for the term financing no 
portfolio 
in june  we amended the loan documents for term financing no 
so that of the stated amount of qualifying letters of credit held for maintenance events would be taken into account in the loan to value test

contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of principal and interest payments on variable and fixed rate liabilities  interest payments on interest rate derivatives  other aircraft acquisition and conversion agreements and rent payments pursuant to our office leases 
total contractual obligations decreased from billion at december  to approximately billion at december  due primarily to principal and interest payments made under our securitizations  term financings and our a pdp facility and lower variable interest rates and payments made under our purchase obligations

at december   we had aircraft purchase agreements and freighter conversion agreements  including the acquisition of one new a aircraft from airbus 

table of contents capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with improvements made to our aircraft 
these expenditures include the cost of major overhauls necessary to place an aircraft in service and modifications made at the request of lessees 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a total of million  million and million  respectively  of capital expenditures including lease incentives related to the acquisition and improvement of aircraft 
as of december   the weighted average age by net book value of our aircraft was approximately years 
in general  the costs of operating an aircraft  including maintenance expenditures  increase with the age of the aircraft 
under our leases  the lessee is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft 
we may incur additional maintenance and modification costs in the future in the event we are required to remarket an aircraft  or a lessee fails to meet its maintenance obligations under the lease agreement 
at december   we had a million maintenance payment liability on our balance sheet  which is a million increase from december  the increase primarily consisted of net maintenance cash inflows of million and lease incentive liabilities of million 
these maintenance reserves are paid by the lessee to provide for future maintenance events 
provided a lessee performs scheduled maintenance of the aircraft  we are required to reimburse the lessee for scheduled maintenance payments 
in certain cases  we are also required to make lessor contributions  in excess of amounts a lessee may have paid  towards the costs of maintenance events performed by or on behalf of the lessee 
actual maintenance payments to us by lessees in the future may be less than projected as a result of a number of factors  including defaults by the lessees 
maintenance reserves may not cover the entire amount of actual maintenance expenses incurred and  where these expenses are not otherwise covered by the lessees  there can be no assurance that our operational cash flow and maintenance reserves will be sufficient to fund maintenance requirements  particularly as our aircraft age 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business risks related to our leases if lessees are unable to fund their maintenance obligations on our aircraft  our cash flow and our ability to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common shares could be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  foreign currency risk and foreign operations at december   all of our leases are payable to us in us dollars 
however  we incur euro and singapore dollar denominated expenses in connection with our subsidiary in ireland and branch office in singapore 
for the year ended december   expenses  such as payroll and office costs  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar aggregated approximately million in us dollar equivalents and represented approximately of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
our international operations are a significant component of our business strategy and permit us to more effectively source new aircraft  service the aircraft we own and maintain contact with our lessees 
therefore  it is likely that our international operations and our exposure to foreign currency risk will increase over time 
although we have not yet entered into foreign currency hedges because our exposure to date has not been significant  if our foreign currency exposure increases we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to mitigate this risk 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred insignificant net gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
hedging the objective of our hedging policy is to adopt a risk averse position with respect to changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have entered into a number of interest rate derivatives to hedge the current and expected 
table of contents future interest rate payments on our variable rate debt 
interest rate derivatives are agreements in which a series of interest rate cash flows are exchanged with a third party over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on an interest rate derivative is not exchanged 
our interest rate derivatives typically provide that we make fixed rate payments and receive floating rate payments to convert our floating rate borrowings to fixed rate obligations to better match the largely fixed rate cash flows from our investments in flight equipment

for the period june through june these interest rate derivatives were designated at inception as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
for the year ended december   the amount of loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income oci into interest expense related to net interest settlements on active interest rate derivatives was million 
the amount of loss expected to be reclassified from oci into interest expense over the next months related to net interest settlements on active interest rate derivatives is million 
our interest rate derivatives involve counterparty credit risk 
as of december   our interest rate derivatives are held with the following counterparties jp morgan chase bank na  citibank canada na  hsh nordbank ag and wells fargo bank na 
all of our counterparties or guarantors of these counterparties are considered investment grade senior unsecured ratings of baa or above by moody s investors service 
all are 
table of contents also considered investment grade long term foreign issuer ratings of a or above by standard and poor s  except hsh nordbank ag  which is not rated 
we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
in addition to the derivative liability above  another component of the fair value of our interest rate derivatives is accrued interest 
as of december   accrued interest payable included in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet was million related to interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
historically  the company acquired its aircraft using short term credit facilities and equity 
the short term credit facilities were refinanced by securitizations or term debt facilities secured by groups of aircraft 
the company completed two securitizations and two term financings during the period through the company entered into interest rate derivatives to hedge interest payments on variable rate debt for acquired aircraft as well as aircraft that it expected to acquire within certain future periods 
in conjunction with its financing strategy  the company used interest rate derivatives for periods ranging from to years to fix the interest rates on the variable rate debt that it incurred to acquire aircraft in anticipation of the expected securitization or term debt re financings 
at the time of each re financing  the initial interest rate derivatives were terminated and new interest rate derivatives were executed as required by each specific debt financing 
at the time of each interest rate derivative termination  certain interest rate derivatives were in a gain position and others were in a loss position 
since the hedged interest payments for the variable rate debt associated with each terminated interest rate derivative were probable of occurring  the gain or loss was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is being amortized into interest expense over the relevant period for each interest rate derivative 
prior to the securitizations and term debt financings  our interest rate derivatives typically required us to post cash collateral to the counterparty when the value of the interest rate derivative exceeded a defined threshold 
when the interest rate derivatives were terminated and became part of a larger aircraft portfolio financing  there were no cash collateral posting requirements associated with the new interest rate derivative 
as of december   we did not have any cash collateral pledged under our interest rate derivatives  nor do we have any existing agreements that require cash collateral postings 
on an ongoing basis  terminated swap notionals are evaluated against debt forecasts 
to the extent that interest payments are deemed remote to occur  deferred gains or losses are accelerated into interest expense as applicable 
due to the sale of certain aircraft in and the resulting repayment of eca term financing debt  amortization of deferred losses was accelerated as noted in the table below

management s use of ebitda we define ebitda as income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization 
we use ebitda to assess our consolidated financial and operating performance  and we believe this non us gaap measure is helpful in identifying trends in our performance 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieving optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
ebitda provides us with a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges on our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
accordingly  this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure  or expenses  of the organization 
ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the consolidated financial performance of our business

limitations of ebitda and ani an investor or potential investor may find ebitda and ani important measures in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use these non us gaap measures to supplement our us gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
ebitda and ani have limitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed in isolation or as substitutes for us gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ebitda and ani  and using these non us gaap measures as compared to us gaap net income  income from continuing operations and cash flows provided by or used in operations  include depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our aircraft  which affects the aircraft s availability for use and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures  the cash portion of income tax benefit provision generally represents charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  elements of our interest rate derivative accounting may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedging policy  and gains and losses from asset sales  which may not reflect the overall financial return of the asset  may be an indicator of the current value of our portfolio of assets 
ebitda and ani are not alternatives to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap 
you should not rely on these non us gaap measures as a substitute for any such us gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliations to us gaap net income  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to 
table of contents evaluate our business 
in addition  because ebitda and ani are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda and ani as presented in this annual report  may differ from and may not be comparable to  similarly titled measures used by other companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in the level of interest rates and the spread between different interest rates 
these risks are highly sensitive to many factors  including us monetary and tax policies  us and international economic factors and other factors beyond our control 
we are exposed to changes in the level of interest rates and to changes in the relationship or spread between interest rates 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our lease agreements  floating rate debt obligations and interest rate derivatives 
rent payments under our aircraft lease agreements typically do not vary during the term of the lease according to changes in interest rates 
however  our borrowing agreements generally require payments based on a variable interest rate index  such as libor 
therefore  to the extent our borrowing costs are not fixed  increases in interest rates may reduce our net income by increasing the cost of our debt without any corresponding increase in rents or cash flow from our securities 
changes in interest rates may also impact our net book value as our interest rate derivatives are periodically marked to market through shareholders equity 
generally  we are exposed to loss on our fixed pay interest rate derivatives to the extent interest rates decrease below their contractual fixed rate 
the relationship between spreads on derivative instruments may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decrease 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our ability to acquire new investments and our ability to realize gains from the settlement of such assets 
sensitivity analysis the following discussion about the potential effects of changes in interest rates is based on a sensitivity analysis  which models the effects of hypothetical interest rate shifts on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we believe a sensitivity analysis provides the most meaningful analysis permitted by the rules and regulations of the sec  it is constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by the inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
although the following results of a sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rates may have some limited use as a benchmark  they should not be viewed as a forecast 
this forward looking disclosure also is selective in nature and addresses only the potential minimum contracted rental and interest expense impacts on our financial instruments and our three variable rate leases and  in particular  does not address the mark to market impact on our interest rate derivatives 
it also does not include a variety of other potential factors that could affect our business as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rates would increase decrease the minimum contracted rentals on our portfolio as of december  by million and million  respectively  over the next twelve months 
as of december   a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in our variable interest rate on our borrowings would result in an interest expense increase decrease of million and million  respectively  net of amounts received from our interest rate derivatives  over the next twelve months
