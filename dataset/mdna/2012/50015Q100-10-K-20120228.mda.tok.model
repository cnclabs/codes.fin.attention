item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information in item above and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are primarily concentrated in the williston basin of north dakota 
our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
using this strategy  we have developed an oil and natural gas asset base of proved reserves  as well as a portfolio of development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential oil and natural gas prospects that we have the opportunity to explore  drill and develop 
we will continue to evaluate and invest in acquisitions and internally generated prospects to increase the value of the company 
 and early acquisitions january acquisition on january   we acquired certain oil and gas leaseholds  overriding royalty interests and producing properties located in north dakota  and various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets  including the assignment and assumption of a drilling rig contract the january acquisition 
the effective date for this acquisition was september  this acquisition contributed no revenue to us for the year ended december   nor were the oil and gas reserves included in our year end reserve estimates 
we closed this acquisition for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
this consideration was comprised of i  shares of the company s common stock and ii cash consideration in an amount equal to approximately million 
the purchase price included million in closing adjustments to reflect the effective date of the acquisition  which includes reimbursement to the seller in this transaction for operational expenditures during the interim period 
we funded the cash balance due at closing through the release from escrow of the proceeds from our november high yield debt offering 
through this acquisition  we acquired approximately  net leasehold acres and net production of approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day located primarily in mckenzie and williams counties  nd we will operate substantially all of the leasehold acquired 
october acquisition on october   we acquired interests in approximately  net acres of williston basin leaseholds  and related producing properties located primarily in williams county  north dakota along with various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets 
the seller in this transaction received cash consideration of approximately million  including certain purchase price adjustments calculated at the closing date 
the effective date for the acquisition was august  june acquisition on june   we acquired interests in approximately  net acres of williston basin leaseholds and related producing properties located in mckenzie county  north dakota along with 
table of contents various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets for a combination of cash and stock 
the seller in this transaction received  shares of the company s common stock valued at approximately million and cash consideration of approximately million 
the effective date for the acquisition was april  november acquisition on november   we acquired interests in approximately  net acres of williston basin leaseholds and related producing properties primarily located in mckenzie county  north dakota for cash consideration of approximately million 
the effective date for the acquisition was august  capital budget our board of directors approved a million capital expenditure budget for  all of which is allocated to oil and gas activities in the williston basin of north dakota 
we have allocated million to the drilling of gross net wells and million for infrastructure build out 
such infrastructure costs will primarily include expenses associated with connecting our wells to gathering systems for which we have contracted with third party pipeline companies 
the remaining million is allocated to our land leasing activities as we further increase our interests in our existing lands 
we anticipate funding this capital program through a combination of existing working capital  an expected increase in our operating cash flows  and additional credit that should be available under our credit facility 
our capital expenditure budget is subject to various factors  including market conditions  oilfield services and equipment availability  commodity prices and drilling results 
while we continue to explore opportunities to expand our acreage position  our current budget is primarily allocated to drilling and completing wells 
additional leasehold acquisitions that we choose to pursue would require us to adjust our budget  as we have not allocated a significant portion of our capital budget to acreage acquisitions 
because of our predominantly contiguous leasehold  kodiak s working interest averages approximately in the operated drilling program  thereby providing flexibility within the budget in identifying suitable well locations and in the timing and size of capital investment 
we anticipate increasing our current six rig program to seven operated rigs during and we believe our permitting procedures will provide us with ample permits as we move through the year 
other factors that could cause us to further adjust our capital expenditure budget include increases or decreases in service and material costs  the formation of joint ventures with other exploration and production companies  the divestiture of non strategic assets  changes in commodity prices or well performance that differ from our forecasts  any of which could affect our operating cash flow 
the following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the year ended december  and our capital expenditures budget for our principal properties in capital expenditures include cash

liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the years ended december  in thousands capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at end of the period cash held in escrow current net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents historically  our primary cash requirements have been for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  which we have financed through the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities  borrowings under lending arrangements with financial institutions and  cash generated from operations 
the aggregate consideration including both cash consideration and equity consideration for our three significant oil and gas property acquisitions during each of which are discussed above under the heading  and early acquisitions was approximately million 
additionally  during  we incurred approximately million in drilling and completion costs and additional leasehold acquisition costs 
the total of the aforementioned acquisitions and our capital expenditures was approximately billion including both cash 
table of contents payments and equity issuances 
in order to fund these expenditures  we undertook the following financing arrangements we conducted equity financing through the sale of our common stock in july and november resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our offering expenses 
as part of these equity offerings we issued a total of million shares of common stock through public offerings 
for further details on these transactions please refer to note common stock under item in this annual report 
as part of the consideration given to close our oil and gas property acquisitions during and early  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
on november   we issued at par million of senior notes due december  the senior notes 
the net proceeds were primarily used to finance our january property acquisition and repay all borrowings under our second lien credit agreement 
for a discussion of the terms of these notes  please see the discussion below under the heading senior notes 
we utilized funds available from our credit facility and the second lien credit agreement to fund a portion of our property acquisitions during as a result of the november equity financing  through the sale of our common stock and senior notes offering  all outstanding balances were paid in full and as of the date of this filing remained unused 
as noted above  the second lien credit agreement was terminated in january  and as of the date of this filing  we have no balance outstanding under our credit facility 
our drilling program is designed to provide flexibility in identifying suitable well locations and in the timing and size of capital investment 
we anticipate funding this capital program and meet our debt service requirements through a combination of existing working capital  the increase in our operating cash flows  and additional credit that may be available through our borrowing base facility 
we plan to finance our capital expenditure budget of million utilizing the following sources of capital cash flow from operations and existing working capital 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
our working capital as of december  included  among other items  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of cash held in escrow and million of prepaid tubular goods to be used in our drilling program 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended was approximately million as compared to million for the same period in this increase is directly related to our successful drilling and completion operations as we have developed our bakken properties and the addition of producing properties through our acquisition activity 
in addition to the increase in the number of wells on production  the per well production has increased as we have enhanced our completion techniques with advanced fracture stimulations 
in  we expect our cash flow from operations to significantly increase commensurate with our increase in estimated production 
if we are able to drill and complete our wells as anticipated and they produce at rates similar to those generated by our existing wells  we would expect our production rates and operating cash flows to grow significantly as we move through we estimate that our average daily sales volumes will be approximately  to  boe per day as compared to approximately  boe per day in senior notes 
as discussed above  during  we issued at par million of senior notes due december  the proceeds received from the offer and sale of the senior notes was deposited into an escrow account  along with other cash  in an amount equal to of the offering price of the senior notes and the interest payable on the senior notes to march  at 
table of contents december   we held million in cash in escrow related to the senior notes 
in january  we closed the january acquisition and all funds were released from escrow 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting discounts and fees 
the net proceeds were primarily used to finance the january acquisition and repay all borrowings under the second lien credit agreement 
the interest on our senior notes is payable on june and december of each year  beginning june  for further discussion regarding the senior notes  please refer to note long term debt under item of this report 
credit facility 
in november  we amended our credit facility pursuant to which we increased our borrowing base to million with a maximum credit amount of million 
this facility  which is currently undrawn  has a maturity date of november  redetermination of the borrowing base occurs semi annually  on april and october additionally  the company may elect a redetermination of the borrowing base one time during any six month period 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under the credit facility 
the ability to maintain this facility and borrow additional funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
further  we expect that our borrowing base will increase with the addition of proved properties as a result of our ongoing drilling and completion activities 
for further details on the credit facility please refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report 
registered offerings 
historically  we have financed our operations  property acquisitions and other capital investments from the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities 
we currently have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement to allow us to offer an indeterminate amount of securities in the future 
under the registration statement  we may offer from time to time debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities or any combination of such securities in amounts  prices and on terms announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering 
we believe our cash flows from operations  our existing working capital and increases in our borrowing base  if necessary and available  will be sufficient to meet our planned capital expenditure budget and to satisfy our obligations under our senior notes and other contractual commitments 
if our existing and potential sources of liquidity were not to be sufficient to satisfy such commitments and to undertake our currently planned expenditures or any revisions thereto  we believe that we have the flexibility in our commitments to alter our drilling program  which may include reducing our rig count and sub contracting our pressure pumping services agreement 
both of these may incur termination fees as discussed under the heading contractual obligations and commitments depending on the timing and contractual requirements of each contract 
as we operate the majority of our acreage  we have the ability to adjust our drilling schedule to reflect the changing commodity price or oil field service environment 
if necessary  we may conduct an offering of our securities  or reduce our ownership through joint ventures or asset sales 
should we reduce our ownership and relinquish the right to operate certain properties  we would become subject to obligations imposed by others  without the ability to control our drilling schedule 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions would satisfy our operating capital requirements and other commitments 
if we were not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations  we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program  and we may be unable to service our debt obligations or satisfy our contractual obligations 

table of contents sec registration obligations in connection with the sale of the senior notes  the company entered into a registration rights agreement that provides the holders of the senior notes certain rights relating to the registration of the senior notes under the securities act 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  the company agreed to conduct a registered exchange offer for the senior notes or cause to become effective a shelf registration statement providing for the resale of the senior notes  each in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
if the company fails to comply with certain obligations under the agreement  it will be required to pay liquidated damages by way of additional interest on the senior notes 
in addition  we have granted to the sellers in the january acquisition certain rights relating to the registration under the securities act of the shares issued pursuant to the acquisition 
operating results production and sales volumes  average sales prices  production costs  and g a expenses the bakken is the only field as such term is used within the meaning of applicable regulations of the sec that contains more than of our total proved reserves 
at december   this field contained of our total proved reserves 
our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices in recent years 
since early  oil prices have steadily increased while natural gas prices have decreased 
we believe that spot market prices reflect worldwide concerns about the global economy  producers ability to ensure sufficient supply of oil to meet increasing demand amid a host of uncertainties caused by political instability  a fluctuating us dollar  and crude oil refining and natural gas infrastructure constraints 
prices that we have historically received have varied widely depending on the commodity and the location of the sales points 
conversely  production costs have increased with the expansion of our activity and the overall demand on services in the williston basin 
the following table discloses our oil and gas production and sales volumes from the bakken field and from our other fields combined and in total  for the periods indicated for the years ended december  sales volume bakken oil bbls gas mcf sales volume other oil bbls gas mcf sales volume total oil bbls gas mcf sales volumes boe natural gas flared mcf total production volume total oil bbls gas mcf production volumes boe includes production of natural gas that is not included in our sales volumes

year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of million for the year ended december  in  our crude oil sales averaged  barrels per day 
our oil sales volume increased to  thousand barrels mbbls in as compared to mbbls in the volume increase is due to our ongoing bakken development program 
these increases are primarily due to bringing net wells on to production in in addition to commodity price increases 
the increased revenue from oil sales in is attributed to a million positive impact due to increased volumes 
additionally  the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  resulting in a positive impact of million in revenue 
overall  of the increase is oil sales revenue was attributed to increased volumes and was attributed to the increase in crude oil prices received 
natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to natural gas revenues of  for the year ended december  natural gas sales volumes increased by  mcf to  mcf for the year ended december  in  our natural gas sales averaged  mcf per day 
the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in the increase in natural gas prices realized resulted in a  increase in natural gas revenues and the increase in natural gas volumes resulted in a million increase in natural gas revenues 
overall  of the increase in natural gas sales revenue was attributed to increased volumes and was attributed to the increase in natural gas prices received 
the increase in our natural gas sales volumes is largely a result of production and sales of associated gas from our bakken properties offset by a decline of our wyoming assets that historically contributed a majority of our natural gas production 
the price realized from sales of our natural gas increased due to the growth of our gas sales from our bakken properties  which has a higher natural gas liquids content compared to our wyoming properties 
although the majority of our gas from the bakken wells to date has been flared  late in  we began connecting our wells to third party pipelines that gather and transport the gas to 
table of contents processing plants and sales pipelines 
during  we connected the majority of our wells to gas pipelines which allowed us to capture the related sales revenue 
industry wide in the williston basin  there is currently a shortage of gas gathering and processing capacity which has limited our ability to sell our gas production 
throughout  we expect to continue to connect our wells to third party facilities  which should allow additional gas volumes to be gathered  processed and sold 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is due to a million increase in production taxes  a million increase in lease operating expenses loe  and a million increase in gathering  transportation and marketing expenses 
the production tax increase is attributable to increased revenue as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of sales revenue 
loe increased year over year due to a higher number of wells that we operate or participate in 
on a per unit basis  loe increased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in as a result of the increase in the number of wells completed during compared to  we incurred more expense in water disposal costs 
the largest cost driver in our williston basin operations is the disposal of water used in the well completion operations 
we expense the water handling costs once oil production is established 
to date  the majority of water has been transported by truck to third party disposal facilities 
late in and throughout  we have progressed in connecting our wells to third party pipelines that transport water directly to disposal facilities 
to date  this activity has been limited to our properties east of the nesson anticline in dunn county  nd 
as we have expanded our operations and completion activities to areas not served by water gathering facilities  we have experienced significant increases in water transportation and disposal costs 
to reduce water disposal costs  in we expect to drill water disposal wells on several of our producing areas and construct water gathering systems where appropriate 
as we connect existing and future wells to these water gathering systems  we expect our loe to decrease on a per unit basis 
in the fourth quarter  we also incurred an expense of approximately  or per barrel sold to relocate a third party pipeline 
additionally  throughout  we incurred additional costs to repair roads from the severe weather conditions that resulted in flooding during the spring of depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dd a expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase is due to increased volumes sold in as sales increased by approximately  boe 
on a per unit basis  dd a increased from per boe in to per boe in this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of proved reserves related to our and acquisitions 
acquired proved reserves are valued at fair market value on the date of acquisition  which contributes to a higher amortization base  as compared to our historical cost of acquiring leasehold and developing our properties 
to date  the fair value of our acquired proved reserves has been higher than our historical cost of developing our properties even though the resulting eur s are equivalent 
therefore  the increase in the ratio of costs subject to amortization to the reserves acquired is greater than our internally developed properties 
we believe that  although initially these acquisitions increase our dd a rate per boe over the development of the acquired properties  the resulting rates will decline with infill drilling and the addition of the related reserves 
additionally  well costs have increased as we began predominantly completing our wells using a greater number of fracture stimulation stages and increased volumes of proppant 
these factors have increased the well completion costs  but we believe that the higher upfront costs will generate overall higher returns through greater production volumes and total oil and gas reserves 
currently  because of the early stages of development of our bakken play  our reserves  especially for undeveloped locations  include the increased well costs  but not the improved reserves 
we believe that as our improved results are reflected in our future estimated reserves  the dda rate per boe will decrease over time 

table of contents general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase is due to the growth in personnel and related costs as we have expanded our operational activities 
total employees have increased to at year end from at year end additionally  in  we incurred approximately  in transaction costs related to the acquisitions that closed in and early  as compared to transaction costs of approximately  in for the acquisition that closed in on a per unit basis  g a decreased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in the decrease is primarily due to our increase in production sales from our ongoing bakken development program 
our oil and natural gas sales volume increased to  mbbls in as compared to mbbls in our g a expense includes the non cash expense for stock based compensation for stock options and share grants under our stock incentive plan 
for the years ended december   this expense was million as compared to million in operating income 
our operating income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the same period in this increase in operating income is attributed to our on going successful completions of wells in our bakken play as well as crude oil price improvement for the year ended as compared to loss on commodity price risk management activities 
for the year ended december   we incurred a total loss on our risk management activities of million 
this loss is a result of our hedging program used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
this loss was comprised of approximately million of realized losses for transactions that were settled during and million of unrealized losses for the mark to market of forward transactions 
the unrealized loss is a non cash adjustment for the value of our risk management transactions at december  these transactions will continue to change in value until the transactions are settled and we will likely add to our hedging program 
therefore  we expect our net income to reflect the volatility of commodity price forward markets 
our cash flows will only be affected upon settlement of the transactions at the current market prices at that time 
interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   we recognized interest expense of approximately million  as compared to  for the same period in included in interest expense in was approximately million of financing costs related to a stand by bridge financing that we obtained to enable the closing of the properties in the january acquisition in the event that we were unable to fund the acquisition with proceeds from the senior notes 
as the bridge financing was not utilized  all financing costs of approximately million were expensed in the fourth quarter of also during  as a result of the extinguishment of the second lien credit agreement in january  we accelerated amortization of the related capitalized deferred financing costs  which resulted in additional amortization expense of approximately million 
we recognized interest expense during of approximately million related to the credit facilities and the issuance of million in senior notes in november additionally  we capitalized interest costs of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income 
our net income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million for although our revenue  net of production expenses  was higher compared to  our net income was negatively impacted by increased dd a  g a  interest expense and  most significantly  the loss on price risk management activities discussed above

if the company does not meet such commitments  the acreage positions or wells may be lost 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies under item of this annual report 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and natural gas reserves estimates estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the quarterly calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas  that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each quarter to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of 
table of contents that quarter 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by asc topic  extractive activities oil and gas  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that quarterly reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and quarterly throughout the year 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all quarterly periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves on a quarterly basis 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment 
changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed  at least annually  for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven  either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist 
under full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  excluding costs associated with unproved properties  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated twelve month arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of each month of the relevant period and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 

table of contents derivative instruments the company has entered into commodity derivative instruments  primarily utilizing swaps or no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
the company s commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying balance sheets as commodity price risk management assets and liabilities 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments 
both the unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from the contract settlement of derivatives are recorded in the commodity price risk management activities line on the consolidated statement of income 
we value our derivative instruments by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as using industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  risk free interest rates  and estimated volatility factors  as well as other relevant economic measures 
the discount rate used in the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk by the counterparty or us  as appropriate 
we utilize the counterparties valuations to assess the reasonableness of our valuations 
the consideration of the factors results in an estimated exit price for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant s view 
management believes that this approach provides a reasonable  non biased  verifiable  and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments 
for additional discussion  please refer to note commodity derivative instruments under item of this annual report 
business combinations we have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under fasb asc topic  business combinations  and involves the use of significant judgment 
the company adopted the updated guidance of asc effective january  and applied it to the acquisition of its acquired properties  june acquired properties  october acquired properties and january acquired properties with each of such terms being as defined below 
for a detailed summary of our acquisitions accounted for under asc  please refer to note acquisitions and divestitures under item of this annual report 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is recognized immediately to earnings as a gain from bargain purchase 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the prior two years consisted of oil and gas properties 
the consideration we have paid to acquire these properties was entirely allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
consequently  there was no goodwill nor any bargain purchase gains recognized on any of our business combinations 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our 
table of contents drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas property 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we have recognized a full valuation allowance against our net deferred taxes because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of estimates of our future operating income based on current oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
at each reporting period  we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  available taxes in carryback periods  tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
future events or new evidence which may lead the company to conclude that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized include  but are not limited to  cumulative historical pre tax earnings  consistent and sustained pre tax earnings  sustained or continued improvements in oil and natural gas commodity prices  continued increases in production and proved reserves from the williston basin 
the company will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of crude oil and natural gas 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan that includes restricted stock shares  restricted stock units rsus  performance awards pas  stock awards  and stock options issued to employees  officers and directors as more fully described in note share based payments under item of this annual report 
we record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock based compensation 
we record compensation expense associated with 
table of contents the issuance of restricted stock shares and rsus based on the estimated fair value of these awards determined at the time of grant 
the pas are payable in cash  except the company may  in its discretion  determine to pay out the pas on the vesting date through the issuance of shares of our common stock 
consequently  as the remaining pas will likely be settled in cash  a liability is recorded and remeasured at each quarter 
pv the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company s unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices without giving effect to hedging activities or future escalation  costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
the following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to pv as of the dates shown in thousands for the years ended december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pv recently issued accounting pronouncements for further information on the effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the potential effects of new accounting pronouncements  refer to the section titled recent accounting pronouncements under note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies under item of this annual report 
effects of pricing and inflation the demand for oil field products and services has increased in the williston basin beginning in and continued throughout typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do the associated costs 
as oil and natural gas prices decline  we would expect associated costs to decline  however  there may be a lag or the changes may be disproportionate to the lower prices 
material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  depletion expense  impairment assessments of oil and gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we enter into derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
we may  from time to time  opportunistically restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to effectively modify the terms of current contracts in order to improve the pricing parameters in existing contracts or realize the current value of our existing positions 
we may use the proceeds from such transactions to secure additional contracts for periods in which we believe there is additional unmitigated commodity price risk or for other corporate purposes 
this section also provides information about our interest rate risk below 
commodity price risk our primary market risk is market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile in the future  which will impact our prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties 
currently  we utilize swaps and no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
all hedges are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we use costless collars to establish floor and ceiling prices on our anticipated future oil production 
we neither receive nor pay net premiums when we enter into these arrangements 
these contracts are settled monthly 
when the settlement price the market price for oil or natural gas on the settlement date for a period is above the ceiling price  we pay our counterparty 
when the settlement price for a period is below the floor price  our counterparty is required to pay us 
we use swaps to fix the sales price for our anticipated future oil production 
upon settlement  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay our counterparty a floating market price  as defined in each instrument 
these instruments are settled monthly 
when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month  we pay our counterparty 
when the fixed price exceeds the floating price  our counterparty is required to make a payment to us 
the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
our wholly owned subsidiary  kodiak oil gas usa inc  is currently a party to derivative contracts with two counterparties  and the company is a guarantor of kodiak oil gas usa inc the company has netting arrangements with the counterparty that provide for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with the counterparty in the event of contract termination 
although the instruments are valued using indices published by established exchanges  the instruments are traded directly with the counterparties 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
the objective of the company s use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage its exposure to commodity price risk 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  these instruments may also limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable
