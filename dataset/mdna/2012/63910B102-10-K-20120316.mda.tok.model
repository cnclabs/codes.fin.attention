item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto found in part ii  item of this report 
all references to the years and mean the twelve month periods ended december  and  respectively 
unless the context otherwise requires  nautilus  we  us and our refer to nautilus  inc and its subsidiaries 
unless indicated otherwise  all information regarding our operating results pertains to our continuing operations 
our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
our revenues typically fluctuate due to the seasonality of our industry  customer buying patterns  product innovation  the nature and level of competition for health and fitness products  our ability to procure products to meet customer demand  the level of spending on  and effectiveness of  our media and advertising programs and our ability to attract new customers and maintain existing sales relationships 
in addition  our revenues are highly susceptible to economic factors  including  among other things  the overall condition of the economy and the availability of consumer credit in both the united states and canada 
our profit margins may vary in response to the aforementioned factors and our ability to manage product costs 
profit margins may also be affected by fluctuations in the costs or availability of materials used to manufacture our products  product warranty costs  higher or lower fuel prices  and changes in costs of other distribution or manufacturing related services 
our operating profits or losses may also be affected by the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization 
historically  our operating expenses have been influenced by media costs to produce and air television advertisements of our products  facility costs  operating costs of our information and communications systems  product supply chain management  customer support and new product development activities 
in addition  our operating expenses have been affected from time to time by asset impairment charges  restructuring charges and other significant unusual or infrequent expenses 
as a result of the above and other factors  our period to period operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
you should not place undue reliance on our operating results and should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by us and other companies  both within and outside our industry 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability 
for more information  see our discussion of risk factors located at part i  item a of this report 
overview we are committed to providing innovative  quality solutions to help people achieve a fit and healthy lifestyle 
our principal business activities include designing  developing  sourcing and marketing high quality cardiovascular and strength fitness products and related accessories for consumer home use  primarily in the united states and canada 
our products are sold under some of the most recognized brand names in the fitness industry nautilus  bowflex  schwinn  schwinn fitness and universal 
we market our products through two distinct distribution channels  direct and retail  which we consider to be separate business segments 
our direct business offers products directly to consumers through television advertising  the internet and catalogs 
our retail business offers our products through a network of third party retailers with stores and websites located in the united states and internationally 
our net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to net sales of million in  largely due to the continued strong demand for our treadclimber products 
this increase was partially offset by comparably lower sales for home gyms and other strength products 
growth in treadclimber sales continues to be driven by consumer acceptance  more effective media advertising and improving consumer credit approval rates 
in september  we completed our transition to a new consumer credit program with a new primary third party financing provider  ge capital retail bank  formerly ge money bank ge 
the relationship with ge has expanded the ability of our customers to obtain third party consumer financing for buying our products 
in addition  we added one secondary third party consumer credit financing provider during the third quarter of and another in early  both of which offer credit to certain qualified consumers whose credit applications have been declined by ge 
as a result of these actions  combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary us third party financing providers increased from in to in income from continuing operations was million for  compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for diluted income per share from continuing operations for was  compared to diluted loss per share of for the significant improvement in results of continuing operations for was largely attributable to 
table of contents increased sales and a reduction in operating expenses achieved primarily through more cost efficient media advertising expenditures 
selling and marketing expenses as a percent of net sales declined to for from for during  we allocated a larger portion of our media expenditures toward our treadclimber product line  compared to in addition  we began implementing a lower cost internet based advertising strategy for our home gyms in  which is designed to capitalize on the extensive product awareness that currently exists among consumers for our bowflex rod based home gyms 
in  we expect to dedicate the majority of our media advertising budget to treadclimbers and a new product  corebody reformer  which was launched in november net income  including loss from the discontinued commercial operation  was million for  an improvement of million over net loss of million for diluted net income per share for was  as compared to diluted net loss per share of for results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria i the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and ii different estimates reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we have not made any material changes in the methodologies we use in our critical accounting estimates during the past three fiscal years and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use 
however  if our assumptions or estimates change in future periods  the impact on our financial position and operating results could be material 
sales discounts and allowances product sales and shipping revenues are reported net of promotional discounts and return allowances 
we estimate the revenue impact of retail sales incentive programs based on the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if the amount of our retail sales incentives can be reasonably estimated  we record the impact of such incentives at the later of the time we notify our customer of the sales incentive  or the time of the sale 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  revenue is adjusted 
our calculation of amounts owed for sales discounts and allowances contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions in interim periods and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including estimated future customer inventory purchases and returns 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation we evaluate our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired 
finite lived intangible assets  including patents and patent rights  are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
no goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in or our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values 
our judgments regarding potential impairment are based on a number of factors including the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows  market conditions  relative levels of risk  the cost of capital  terminal values  royalty rates  and the allocation of revenues  expenses and assets and liabilities to business segments 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of our goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets and  thereby  could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
product warranty obligations our products carry limited defined warranties for defects in materials or workmanship 
our product warranties generally obligate us to pay for the cost of replacement parts  cost of shipping the parts to our customers and  in certain instances  
table of contents service labor costs 
at the time of sale  we record a liability for the estimated costs of fulfilling future warranty claims 
the estimated warranty costs are recorded as a component of cost of sales  based on historical warranty claim experience and available product quality data 
if necessary  we adjust our liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
our estimates of warranty expenses are based on significant judgment  and the frequency and cost of warranty claims are subject to variation 
warranty expenses are affected by the performance of new products  significant manufacturing or design defects not discovered until after the product is delivered to the customer  product failure rates and variances in expected repair costs 
uncertainties exist with respect to outstanding warranty obligations of our discontinued commercial business  as units sold to customers approach end of life and settlements are reached with certain customers in connection with our exit from the commercial business 
as of december   our warranty liability included million for future warranty costs of our former commercial business  which represents management s estimate of the probable amount 
litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such matters involve uncertainty as to the eventual outcomes and any losses or gains we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record expenses for litigation and loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate the probability of such losses based on the advice of internal and external counsel  outcomes from similar litigation  status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates accordingly 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we account for income taxes based on the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to be included  as income or expense  in the applicable tax return 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the enactment 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets of million 
if our assumptions change and we determine we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance will be accounted for in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant judgments are required in determining tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
such judgments require us to interpret existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our circumstances 
in particular  our valuation allowance contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the future realization of net deferred tax assets 
if our financial results or other relevant facts change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position  significant judgment would be applied in determining the effect of the change on our valuation allowance 

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in this report

table of contents year ended december  change change direct net sales cardio products strength products total direct net sales retail net sales cardio products strength products total retail net sales royalty income total net sales cardio products include treadclimbers  treadmills  exercise bikes and ellipticals 
strength products include home gyms  selectorized dumbbells  kettlebell weights  weight benches and corebody reformer 
direct net sales of our direct business were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to direct net sales of million in revenues of cardio products in our direct channel increased by in  compared to  primarily due to higher sales of bowflex treadclimber products 
the increase in direct sales of cardio products was partially offset by a decline in direct sales of strength products  primarily rod based home gyms 
the decline in sales of rod based home gyms is attributable in part to the cessation of television advertising for these products  as television ad spending on this mature product category was generating unsatisfactory returns 
we have marketed rod based home gyms through more cost efficient online media since early in september  we completed our transition to a new consumer credit program with a new primary third party financing provider  ge capital retail bank  formerly ge money bank ge 
the relationship with ge has expanded the ability of our customers to obtain third party consumer financing for buying our products 
in addition  we added one secondary third party consumer credit financing provider during the third quarter of and another in early  both of which offer credit to certain qualified consumers whose credit applications have been declined by ge 
as a result  combined consumer credit approvals by our primary and secondary us third party financing providers increased from in to in we expect that average consumer credit financing approval rates in will approximate the level or improve modestly as we continue to optimize our credit program offerings 
gross margin of our direct business was in  a decrease of basis points compared to the comparative decrease in direct gross margin was primarily attributable to relatively higher warranty costs associated with cardio products  as compared to strength products  increased costs of certain products  largely arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and higher year over year sales of in home assembly services  which are sold at low margins 
retail net sales of our retail business were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to retail net sales of million in  primarily driven by growth among our e commerce retail customers

operating expenses operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating expenses of million in this reduction was achieved primarily through more effective media advertising  which enabled more

in addition  general and administrative expenses decreased by million in  compared to selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to advertising expense of our direct business  a component of selling and marketing expenses  in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the comparative decrease in direct advertising expenses was primarily attributable to management s decision in early to shift advertising away from the mature home gym category and to increase the media investment in our treadclimber product line 
since early  we have marketed home gyms through more cost efficient online media 
lower comparable direct advertising expenses were offset in part by higher consumer credit financing costs  as a result of sequentially improving consumer credit approval rates  and the availability of additional secondary consumer financing providers in  as compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to  primarily due to lower depreciation  personnel and occupancy expenses 
research and development research and development expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to  as we increased our investment in new product development resources and capabilities 
other income and expense interest expense we incurred interest expense of million in in connection with our long term note payable  compared to million in we have not borrowed under our current financing agreement with bank of the west  other than to fund our outstanding letters of credit 
other expense other expense was less than million in  compared to million in  primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in  compared to income tax expense of million in  and primarily relates to taxable income generated in canada and the result of the company s uncertain tax positions 
we increased our valuation allowances in to reduce us deferred income tax assets generated during the respective years to the amounts expected  more likely than not  to be realized 
as a result  generally we did not recognize us income tax benefits associated with our operating loss in discontinued operation loss from discontinued operation  net of income taxes  was million in  compared to a loss of million in  as we completed the disposal of the assets of our former commercial business in april loss from discontinued operation in and was net of reductions of million and million  respectively  in the amount of pre tax disposal loss previously estimated in connection with the divestiture of our commercial business 
some expenses may be incurred in in connection with the settlement of contingencies arising from and directly related to our commercial business prior to its disposal 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of december  the principal source of this increase in liquidity was cash provided by operating activities of million in  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in management believes that sufficient funds will be 
table of contents available to meet our expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months  based on cash currently on hand and anticipated cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities of million in consisted primarily of income from continuing operations  partially offset by loss from discontinued operation  as adjusted for non cash items 
cash provided by a million increase in trade payables was more than offset by a million increase in trade receivables and a million increase in inventories 
cash used in operating activities of million in consisted primarily of losses from continuing and discontinued operations of million and reductions in trade payables and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively  partially offset by million from income tax refunds  net of payments  million from the reduction of trade receivables and million from the reduction of inventories 
significant reductions in trade receivables  trade payables and accrued liabilities in largely resulted from winding down our discontinued commercial business 
the following table presents comparative cash flows related to trade receivables and inventories for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  change trade receivables collections sales on account net cash used provided by trade receivables inventories shipments purchases net cash used provided by inventories cash used in investing activities of million in included million used to purchase computer software and production tooling  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of portions of our discontinued commercial business and million from a decrease in the amount of restricted cash collateralizing our outstanding letters of credit 
cash provided by investing activities of million in included million in proceeds from the sale of portions of our discontinued commercial business and million from a decrease in the amount of restricted cash collateralizing our outstanding letters of credit 
cash used in financing activities in was less than million for payment of bank financing costs 
cash provided by financing activities in of million consisted of million in long term borrowings  partially offset by million paid for financing costs related to our new bank agreement and long term borrowings 
financing arrangements we have a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with bank of the west  which provides a revolving secured credit line of up to million 
the amount available for borrowings varies based upon the total amount of eligible accounts receivable and inventory as of the end of the preceding month 
the loan agreement is available for working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes through august   assuming we satisfy certain terms and conditions at the time borrowings are requested 
the interest rate on future borrowings  if any  under the loan agreement will be based on the bank s base rate plus to basis points or libor plus to basis points and our financial condition at the time we elect to borrow our borrowing rate was as of december  
the loan agreement includes a fee for the unused portion of the credit facility  which will vary depending on our borrowing base availability 
the loan agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and contains customary covenants  including minimum current ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum ebitda as defined in the loan agreement and limitations on capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  indebtedness  liens  dispositions  dividends and investments 
the loan agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon an event of default  the bank would have the option of accelerating all obligations under the loan agreement 
standby letters of credit under the loan agreement are treated as a reduction of our available 
table of contents borrowing base 
on july   we entered into a third amendment the amendment of the loan agreement 
the effect of the amendment was generally to ease the restrictiveness of certain provisions by increasing our borrowing availability  raising the limitation on our capital expenditures and reducing interest rates applicable to any outstanding amounts 
the amendment  dated effective june   increases the amount of eligible accounts receivable for calculating the borrowing base 
specifically  the amendment i permits up to of total accounts receivable included in the borrowing base to consist of receivables of a specific customer  an increase from the prior limitation of  and ii permits accounts receivable of certain customers granted extended payment terms to be included in the borrowing base  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
in addition  bank of the west agreed to increase the limitation on our capital expenditures permitted in any one calendar year from  to  and to reduce the interest rate margins applied to amounts outstanding under the loan agreement 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and million in standby letters of credit issued under the loan agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the loan agreement 
on september   we entered into a note purchase agreement the purchase agreement with certain entities collectively  the sherborne purchasers under common control of sherborne investors gp  llc and its affiliates collectively sherborne 
sherborne was formerly our largest shareholder and is controlled by edward j 
bramson  our former chairman and chief executive officer  and craig l 
mckibben  a former member of our board of directors 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we issued to the sherborne purchasers  in aggregate principal amount at maturity of our increasing rate senior discount notes due december  the notes 
the notes have an original principal amount totaling  and mature on december  the then outstanding principal amount of the notes accretes value at rates equal to per annum from september  through february   per annum from march  through august   per annum from september  through february   per annum from march  through august   and per annum thereafter 
if all the notes are paid on the original maturity date  the effective rate of interest over the term of the purchase agreement would be approximately per annum 
prepayment of amounts due under the notes is permitted under the purchase agreement  subject to certain restrictions in both the purchase agreement and the loan agreement 
the notes provide for an automatic extension of the maturity date of up to days in the event we extend the expiration date of the loan agreement 
subsequent to december   we extended the expiration date of the loan agreement to december   thereby extending the maturity date of the notes to may  as of december   the notes are classified as long term 
on july   beneficial interest in the notes was assigned by the sherborne purchasers pro rata to their respective investors in the manner permitted by the purchase agreement 
such assignment was made in connection with the resignation  of messrs 
bramson and mckibben from their respective positions with nautilus on may   and the subsequent pro rata distribution by certain sherborne affiliated entities to their respective investors of the common stock of the company owned by such entities 
the notes are subordinated to the loan agreement 
the purchase agreement includes certain negative covenants  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  liquidation of assets  capital expenditures  payment of dividends  changes in our business operations and change of control transactions 
the purchase agreement includes customary events of default  including nonpayment  insolvency  breach of warranty or covenant  cross default of the loan agreement  material adverse changes and other events 
upon the occurrence of an event of default all outstanding obligations under the notes may be declared due and payable 
the accretion rate of the notes may be increased by per annum during the continuance of an event of default 
non cancelable contractual obligations our operating cash flows include the effect of certain non cancelable  contractual obligations 
a summary of such obligations as of december   including those related to our discontinued commercial operation  is as follows in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations minimum royalty obligations total our purchase obligations are comprised primarily of inventory purchase commitments 
because substantially all of our inventory is sourced from asia  we have long lead times and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions  have been excluded from the contractual table above 
for further information  refer to note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to its divestiture  our discontinued commercial business would  from time to time  involve a third party with lease and financing arrangements to assist customers in purchasing products 
while most of these financings were without recourse  in certain cases we offered a guarantee or other recourse provisions  whereby a third party financing provider reviewed customer credit information in evaluating the risk of default prior to extending credit to a customer and we relied on the quality of this review and our own risk assessment in determining whether to proceed with the recourse transaction 
as of december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million 
for further information  refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that require us to indemnify counterparties against third party claims 
these may include agreements with vendors and suppliers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from our use of their products or services  agreements with customers  under which we may indemnify them against claims arising from their use or sale of our products  real estate and equipment leases  under which we may indemnify lessors against third party claims relating to the use of their property  agreements with licensees or licensors  under which we may indemnify the licensee or licensor against claims arising from their use of our intellectual property or our use of their intellectual property  and agreements with parties to debt arrangements  under which we may indemnify them against claims relating to their participation in the transactions 
the nature and terms of these indemnifications vary from contract to contract  and generally a maximum obligation is not stated 
we hold insurance policies that mitigate potential losses arising from certain types of indemnifications 
because we are unable to estimate our potential obligation  and because management does not expect these obligations to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no liabilities are recorded at december  seasonality we expect our sales from fitness equipment products to vary seasonally 
sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters  followed by the third quarter  and are generally weakest in the second quarter 
we believe that various factors  such as the broadcast of network season finales and seasonal weather patterns  influence television viewers and cause our advertising on cable television stations to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods 
in addition  during the spring and summer months  consumers tend to be involved in outdoor activities  including outdoor exercise  which impacts sales of indoor fitness equipment 
this seasonality can have a significant effect on our inventory levels  working capital needs and resource utilization 
new accounting pronouncements no new accounting pronouncements had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
