background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august in  we completed an ipo 
in  we divested all of our assets except otisville biotech  inc  and became a financial services company with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity 
in  we registered as an investment company under the act  commencing operations as a closed end  non diversified investment company 
in  we elected to become a bdc subject to the provisions of sections through of the act 
we believe we provide five core benefits to our shareholders 
first  we are an established firm with a positive track record of investing in venture capital backed companies 
second  we provide shareholders with access to emerging nanotechnology enabled companies that would otherwise be difficult to access or inaccessible for most current and potential shareholders 
third  we have an existing portfolio of companies at varying stages of maturity that provide for a potential pipeline of investment returns over time 
fourth  we are able to invest opportunistically in a range of types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies 
fifth  we provide access to venture capital investments in a vehicle that  unlike private venture capital firms  is both transparent and liquid 
we invest in companies enabled by nanotechnology and microsystems 
we believe companies that leverage breakthroughs at the nanoscale are emerging as leaders in their respective industries 
these companies primarily impact the energy  healthcare and electronics sectors 
we focused the company on making venture capital investments in companies that commercialize and integrate products enabled by nanotechnology in we believe this was the period of time when nanotechnology was beginning to emerge from its gestational phase to its commercial phase 
we believe the coming decades will be the period of time when the commercial impact of nanotechnology will become widespread 
we believe that as this occurs  our portfolio companies are well positioned to profit and that we will see investment returns as a result 
we define venture capital investments as the money and resources made available to privately held and publicly traded small businesses with exceptional growth potential 
we believe that we are the only us based  publicly traded venture capital company making investments exclusively in nanotechnology and microsystems 
we believe we have invested in more nanotechnology enabled companies than any other venture capital firm 
nanotechnology is the study of structures measured in nanometers  which are units of measurement in billionths of a meter 
microsystems are measured in micrometers  which are units of measurement in millionths of a meter 
we sometimes use tiny technology to describe both of these disciplines 
we consider a company to fit our investment thesis if the company employs or intends to employ technology that we consider to be at the microscale or smaller  and if the employment of that technology is material to its business plan 
by making these investments  we seek to provide our shareholders with a specific focus on nanotechnology and microsystems through a portfolio of venture capital investments that address a variety of industries  markets and products 
we believe nanotechnology can be classified as a transformative technology 
an innovation qualifies as a transformative technology if it has the potential for pervasive use in a wide range of sectors in ways that change the competitive dynamics in those sectors 
transformative technologies often take decades to fully diffuse through respective sectors 
we believe the period of through was the first decade in the commercial development of nanotechnology products 
according to the national science foundation and the national nanotechnology initiative  this decade witnessed average growth rates of nanotechnology related research and development funding  peer reviewed publications and patent applications of percent to percent 
according to the same institutions  nanotechnology enabled companies created over  jobs worldwide and introduced over billion worth of products 
our portfolio companies experienced similar growth during this period of time with aggregate revenues increasing percent from to  and percent from to we are currently in the second decade in the commercial development of nanotechnology products 
we believe it will be this second decade and beyond where large portions of industry come to rely on nanotechnology as a fundamental enabler of advanced products 
investment objective and strategy our principal investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation by making equity focused venture capital investments 
therefore  a significant portion of our current venture capital investment portfolio provides little or no income in the form of dividends or interest 
current income is a secondary investment objective 
we seek to reach the point where future growth is financed through reinvestment of our capital gains from our venture capital investments and where current income offsets portions of our annual expenses during periods of time between realizations of capital gains on our investments 
we also plan to implement a strategy to grow assets under management by raising one or more third party funds to manage 
there is no assurance when and if we will be able to raise such fund s or  if raised  whether they will be successful 
we have discretion in the investment of our capital to achieve our objectives 
we seek long term capital appreciation through venture capital investments in equity related securities of companies that we believe have exceptional growth potential 
these businesses can range in stage from pre revenue to generating positive cash flow 
these businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  have little or no history of operations and are developing unproven technologies 
these businesses may be privately held or publicly traded 
we historically have invested in equity securities of these companies that are generally illiquid due to restrictions on resale and to the lack of an established trading market 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in equity and equity related securities in later sections of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a as our equity focused portfolio of investments 
we may take advantage of opportunities to generate near term cash flow by investing in non convertible debt securities of businesses 
these businesses tend to be generating cash or have near term visibility to reaching positive cash flow 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in non convertible debt in later sections of the md a as our venture debt portfolio of investments 
we are early stage and long term investors 
we seek to identify investment opportunities in industries and markets that will be growth opportunities three to seven years from the date of our initial investment 
we expect to invest capital in these companies at multiple points in time subsequent to our initial investment 
we refer to such investments as follow on investments 
our efforts to identify and predict future growth industries and markets rely on patient and deep due diligence in nanotechnology enabled innovations developed at universities and corporate and government research laboratories  and the examination of macroeconomic and microeconomic trends and industry dynamics 
we believe it is the early identification of and investments in these growth opportunities that will lead to investment returns for our shareholders  growth of our net assets  and capital for us to invest in tomorrow s growth opportunities 
involvement with portfolio companies the act requires that bdcs offer to make available significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies 
we are actively involved with our portfolio companies through membership on boards of directors  as observers to the boards of directors and or through frequent communication with management 
as of december   we held at least one board seat or observer rights on of our equity focused portfolio companies percent 
we may hold two or more board seats in early stage portfolio companies or those in which we have significant ownership 
we may transition off of the board of directors to an observer role as our portfolio companies raise additional capital from new investors  as they mature or as they are able to attract independent members who have relevant industry experience and contacts 
we also typically step off the board of directors upon the completion of an ipo 
our observer rights at board of directors meetings commonly cease when companies complete an ipo 
we held observer rights in neophotonics corporation and solazyme  inc  until the completion of each company s ipo 
we may be involved actively in the formation and development of business strategies of our earliest stage portfolio companies 
this involvement may include hiring management  licensing intellectual property  securing space and raising additional capital 
we also provide managerial assistance to late stage companies looking for potential exit opportunities by leveraging our relationships with the banking and investment community and our knowledge and experience in running a micro capitalization publicly traded business 
historical investments and current investment pace since our investment in otisville in through december   we have made a total of equity focused venture capital investments 
we have exited of these investments  realizing total gross proceeds of  on our cumulative invested capital of  the gross proceeds received include our upfront payment from the sale of biovex group  inc  to amgen  inc  in the first quarter of  but do not include the potential milestone payments that could occur as part of this transaction at points in time in the future or the portion of the upfront payment held in escrow as of december  the gross proceeds received also include our upfront payment from the sale of innovalight  inc  to ei du pont de nemours and company dupont in the third quarter of and the sale of crystal is  inc  to the asahi kasei group in the fourth quarter of  but do not include the portion of the upfront payments held in escrow as of december  both the gross proceeds and the cumulative invested capital do not reflect the cost or value of our ownership of neophotonics or solazyme which completed ipos on february   and may   respectively  as we have not yet sold or had our shares called from us through exercise of the call options written by us on a portion of these investments 
from august through december   all of our initial equity focused investments have been in companies commercializing or integrating products enabled by nanotechnology or microsystems 
from august through december   we have invested a total before any subsequent write ups  write downs or dispositions of  in these companies 
we currently have equity focused companies in our portfolio 
at december   from first dollar in  the average and median holding periods for these investments were each years 
historically  as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out  the average and median holding periods for the investments we have exited were years and years  respectively 
the following is a summary of our initial and follow on equity focused investments in nanotechnology companies from january   to december  we consider a round led to be a round where we were the new investor or the leader of a group of investors in an investee company 
typically  but not always  the lead investor negotiates the price and terms of the deal with the investee company 
investments in our equity focused portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies total incremental investments   no 
of new investments no 
of follow on investment rounds no 
of rounds led average dollar amount initial   average dollar amount follow on   during the twelve months ended december   we made three venture debt investments 
the following is a summary of our investments in venture debt to date 
investments in our venture debt portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies no 
of investments total dollar amount   in the fourth quarter of  we made a  venture debt investment in one of our equity focused portfolio companies 
we note that all amounts  values and numbers mentioned below regarding our equity focused portfolio companies include this investment in those calculations 
importance of availability of liquid capital private venture capital funds are structured commonly as limited partnerships with a committed level of capital and finite lifetime 
capital is called from limited partners to make investments and pay for expenses of running the firm at various points within the lifetime of the fund 
for each initial investment  the fund must reserve additional capital for follow on investments at later stages of the life of the portfolio companies 
these follow on investments are required because often venture backed portfolio companies in areas in which we invest  whether privately held or publicly traded  operate with negative cash flow for lengthy periods of time 
in general  the cumulative total of initial invested capital and reserves cannot exceed the committed level of capital of the fund 
our strategy for investing capital is similar to this approach in some respects 
we make initial investments in privately held and publicly traded companies and project the amount of capital that may be required should the company mature successfully 
these projections  equivalent to the reserves of private venture capital funds  are reviewed weekly by management  are updated frequently and are a component of the data that guide our decisions on whether to make new and follow on investments 
as a publicly traded  internally managed venture capital company  our cash used to make investments and pay expenses is held by us and not called from external sources when needed 
accordingly  it is crucial that we operate the company with a substantial balance of liquid capital for this reason and for four additional reasons 
we manage the company and our investment criteria and pace such that our projected needs for capital to make new and follow on investments do not exceed the total of our liquid investments 
although we use best efforts to predict when this capital will be required for use in new and follow on investments  we cannot predict with certainty the timing for these investments 
we would be unable to make new or follow on investments in our portfolio companies without having substantial liquid resources of capital available to us 
venture capital firms traditionally invest beside other venture capital firms in a process called syndication 
the size of the fund and the amount of capital reserves available to syndicate partners is often an attribute that potential co investors consider when deciding on syndicate partners 
as we do not have committed capital from limited partners  we believe we must have adequate available liquid capital on our balance sheet to be able to have access to high quality deal flow 
we rarely commit the total amount of cumulative capital intended for investment in any portfolio company at one point in time 
instead  our investments consist of multiple rounds of financing of a given portfolio company  in which we typically participate if we believe that the merits of such an investment outweigh the risks 
we also commonly have preemptive rights to invest additional capital in our privately held portfolio companies 
these rights are useful to protect and potentially increase the value of our positions in our portfolio companies as they mature 
commonly  the terms of such financings in privately held companies also include penalties for those investors that do not invest in these subsequent rounds of financing 
without available capital at the time of investment  our ownership in the company would be subject to these penalties that can lead to a partial or complete loss of the capital invested prior to that round of financing 
we may have the opportunity to increase ownership in late rounds of financing in some of our most mature companies 
many private venture capital funds that invested in these companies are reaching the end of the term associated with their limited partnerships 
this issue may limit the available capital to these funds for follow on investments  and the ability to take advantage of potentially valuable terms given to those who have investable capital 
having permanent  liquid capital available for investment and access to the capital markets allows us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise 
our sources of liquid capital the sources of liquidity that we use to make our investments are classified as primary and secondary liquidity 
as of december   and december   our total primary and secondary liquidity was  and  respectively 
we do not include our credit facility as primary or secondary liquidity 
primary liquidity is comprised of cash and certain receivables 
as of december   we held  in cash  of which  was held in non interest bearing  fully fdic insured bank accounts 
as of december   we held in us government obligations 
during the first quarter of  we received the upfront payment of million from the disposition of biovex 
during the third quarter of  we received approximately million from the disposition of innovalight 
during the fourth quarter of  we received approximately million from the disposition of crystal is 
these payments immediately added to our primary liquidity 
payments upon achieving milestones of the biovex acquisition or expiration of the escrow periods for the biovex  crystal is and innovalight acquisitions would also add to our primary liquidity in future quarters if these milestones are achieved successfully and escrowed funds are released in part or in full 
the probability adjusted value of the future milestone payments for the biovex acquisition and of the funds held in escrow from the acquisitions of biovex  crystal is and innovalight  as determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  is included as an asset on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and will be included in primary liquidity only when payment is received for achievement of the milestones 
our secondary liquidity is comprised of the stock of publicly traded companies 
although these companies are publicly traded  their stock may not trade at high volumes and prices may be volatile  which may restrict our ability to sell our positions at any given time 
as of december   our secondary liquidity was  neophotonics and solazyme account for  of this amount based on the closing price of each company as of december  champions oncology accounts for  of the total amount of secondary liquidity 
as of december   our shares of each of these companies are freely tradable securities 
a decision to sell our shares would result in the cash received from the sale of these assets being included in primary liquidity 
until that time  we will continue to include the value of our shares of our publicly traded portfolio companies in secondary liquidity unless the average trading volume of each company reaches sufficient levels for us to monetize our stock in such companies over a short period of time 
should additional portfolio companies successfully complete ipos or should we make additional investments in publicly traded companies  our source of secondary liquidity could materially increase 
we believe these developments make it important  therefore  to examine both our primary and secondary liquidity when assessing the strength of our balance sheet and our future investment capabilities 
liquidity events from our portfolio in during the year ended december   we had five liquidity events in the portfolio 
on december   the asahi kasei group completed its acquisition of crystal is 
we received a portion of our payment of million for our securities of crystal is 
as of december   approximately  in additional proceeds from the transaction is held in escrow to cover potential indemnity claims  working capital shortfalls and the expenses of the stockholder agent 
the majority of this amount is held in escrow for a period of months from the date of the transaction 
on july   dupont completed its acquisition of innovalight 
we received payment of million for our securities of innovalight 
as of december   approximately  in additional proceeds from the transaction is held in escrow to cover potential indemnity claims for a period of months from the date of the transaction 
on may   solazyme completed an ipo by selling  shares of common stock at per share 
the common stock of solazyme trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol szym 
as of december   we owned an aggregate of  shares of solazyme 
this position was valued at  as of december  our valuation of solazyme as of december   was based on the share price as of the close of trading on december   which was 
as of march   solazyme s closing price was per share 
in december  we sold call options covered by a portion of our shares owned of solazyme that resulted in cash premiums paid to the company of  on march   amgen completed its acquisition of biovex 
the acquisition included an upfront payment of million and milestone payments of up to million 
on march   we received our upfront payment of  as of december   our portion of the upfront payment that remained in escrow was approximately  as of december   we valued potential milestone payments and funds held in escrow from the sale of biovex at  if all the remaining milestone payments were to be paid by amgen  and if the full amount held in escrow is released  we would receive  we have not received any milestone payments as of december   and there can be no assurances as to how much of this amount we will ultimately realize in the future  if any 
on february   neophotonics completed an ipo by selling  shares of common stock at per share 
the common stock of neophotonics trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol nptn 
as of december   we owned an aggregate of  shares of neophotonics 
this position was valued at  as of december  potential liquidity events from our portfolio in in the first quarter of  one of our portfolio companies received a non binding letter of interest for the potential acquisition of the company 
as of march   the discussion between these two companies is ongoing  and there can be no assurance that these companies will reach mutually acceptable terms to consummate a transaction 
also in the first quarter of  three of our portfolio companies have commenced planning for and or began the process of hiring bankers to pursue potential sales and or ipos of those companies 
as of march   these efforts are ongoing  and there can be no assurance that either of these companies will be able to consummate either type of transaction 
strategy for managing publicly traded positions our equity focused portfolio companies may seek to raise capital and provide liquidity to shareholders through ipos 
it is generally rare that pre ipo investors are afforded the ability to sell a portion of shares owned in the ipo 
these pre ipo shares are often subject to lock up provisions that prevent the sale of those shares  options against those shares or other transactions associated with those shares until expiration of the lock up period  which is often days from the date of the ipo 
we commonly plan to hold our shares of our publicly traded portfolio companies following the expiration of the lock up restrictions if we believe that the prospects for future growth of the portfolio company and the underlying value of our shares are as great or greater than other opportunities we are currently encountering 
we believe we are able to make such assessments using our extensive knowledge of the companies having actively worked with them and their management teams over multiple years as pre ipo investors 
as such  we may hold our shares of publicly traded portfolio companies for extended periods of time from the date of ipo 
following the expiration of the lock up restrictions  we may pursue the sale of call options covered by our ownership of shares in our publicly traded portfolio companies 
the company will only sell or write options on common stocks held in the company s portfolio 
we will not sell naked call options  ie  options representing more shares of the stock than are held in the portfolio 
these call options give the buyer the right to purchase our stock at a given price  the strike price  prior to a specific date  the expiration date 
a call option whose strike price is above the current price of the underlying stock is called out of the money 
most of the options that will be sold by us are expected to be out of the money  allowing for potential appreciation in addition to the proceeds from the sale of the option 
when stocks in the portfolio rise  call options that were out of the money when written may become in the money  thereby increasing the likelihood that they could be exercised  and we would be forced to sell the stock 
for conventional listed call options  the options expiration date can be up to nine months from the date the call options are first listed for trading 
longer term call options can have expiration dates up to three years from the date of listing 
we currently expect to write call options with expirations of no more than nine months from the date the call option is first listed for trading 
we believe this strategy of selling covered call options on our publicly traded portfolio companies provides at least three benefits we receive payment of a premium in cash at the time of the sale of the call option 
the amount of the premium received is negotiated between the buyer and us and is influenced generally by the market price of the underlying stock  the volatility of the stock and the length of time between the date of sale of the call option and the expiration date 
if the option expires out of the money  we retain the premium as a gain on our investment 
if the option is exercised  it enables the monetization of the stock held by us in an orderly transaction that yields known returns 
our publicly traded portfolio companies currently trade at small average daily volumes of shares compared with our positions in these companies 
as such  a decision by us to sell a portion or all of our shares in these companies in the public markets through brokers could negatively affect the price at which we would be able to sell these shares and  therefore  our ultimate returns 
the sale of a call option sets a price at which our shares would sell if the option is exercised  which negates the potential impact of illiquidity or other market dynamics on our returns from the sale of these shares 
that said  it also sets an upper limit for the proceeds we would receive in such sale 
we plan to enter into such contracts at a price per share and in a timeframe that we would be willing to sell those shares 
while we may repurchase call options when advantageous to us  we commonly do not sell call options with the expectation that we will repurchase them at a future date 
the sale of options may help generate interest and liquidity in the stock of our publicly traded portfolio companies 
current market dynamics make it difficult for small capitalization stocks to attract interest from institutional and retail investors 
this difficulty leads to low average trading volumes and low liquidity options for existing shareholders 
we believe the sale of call options may aid in increasing the interest and liquidity in the stock of these companies and may be beneficial to our future potential returns on these investments 
maturity of current equity focused venture capital portfolio our equity focused venture capital portfolio is composed of companies at varying maturities facing different types of risks 
we have defined these levels of maturity and sources of risk as early stage technology risk  mid stage market risk and late stage execution risk 
early stage companies have a high degree of technical  market and execution risk  which is typical of initial investments by venture capital firms  including us 
these companies often require substantial development of their technologies before they begin introducing products to market 
mid stage companies are those that have overcome most of the technical risk associated with their products and are now focused on addressing the market acceptance for their products 
for those companies developing therapeutics or medical devices  the focus is on bringing their products through the first phases of clinical trials 
late stage companies are those that have determined there is a market for their products  and they are now focused on sales execution and scale 
late stage healthcare and biotechnology companies are typically either in phase iii clinical trials  which are the pivotal trials before a possible fda approval and commercial launch of a product  or are generating revenue from the commercial sale of one or more products 
the charts below show our assessment of the stage of maturity of the companies in our equity focused portfolio of investments and include the cost and value ascribed to the companies within each of these stages of maturity 
we seek to create a portfolio of companies that enables consistent flows of potential liquidity events in multiple industries in three sectors  energy  healthcare and electronics  which can be monetized as these companies mature 
we classify energy companies as those that seek to improve performance  productivity or efficiency  and to reduce environmental impact  waste  cost  consumption or raw materials using nanotechnology enabled solutions 
we have historically used the term cleantech to describe these types of companies 
we now use the term energy to describe these companies and include our companies formerly classified as cleantech companies in this category 
we classify healthcare companies as those that use nanotechnology to address problems in healthcare related industries  including biotechnology  pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
we classify electronics companies as those that address problems in electronics related industries  including semiconductors 
we believe a portfolio of companies focused on a diverse set of industries reduces the potential impact of cyclicality of any one industry 
our current portfolio is comprised of companies at varying stages of maturity in a diverse set of industries within three sectors 
we also include our positive exits from these portfolios 
we consider nanogram devices to have been both an energy and a healthcare portfolio company 
as our portfolio companies mature  we seek to invest in new early and mid stage companies that may mature into mid and late stage companies 
this continuous progression creates a pipeline of investment maturities that may lead to future sources of positive contributions to net asset value per share as these companies mature and potentially experience liquidity and exit events 
this diversity of industries and our pipeline of investment maturities are demonstrated by the distribution of our current early and mid stage portfolio companies within each sector shown in the table below 
we expect some of our portfolio companies to transition between stages of maturity over time 
this transition may be forward if the company is maturing and is successfully executing its business plan or may be backward if the company is not successfully executing its business plan or decides to change its business plan substantially from its original plan 
transitions backward are commonly accompanied by an increase in non performance risk  which reduces valuation 
we discuss non performance risk and its implications on value below in the section titled valuation of investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we did not transition any companies between classifications of stage of maturity  however  we sold crystal is  inc  which was included in our energy portfolio as an early stage company 
we currently have companies in our equity focused venture capital portfolio that generate revenues ranging from nominal to significant from commercial sales of products and or services  from commercial partnerships and or from government grants 
in aggregate  our portfolio companies had approximately million in revenue in  an percent increase from aggregate revenue of approximately million and a percent increase from aggregate revenue of million 
current business environment the fourth quarter of ended with broad increases in value in the public market indices  but the values of nanotechnology related companies and investment companies lagged behind these indices 
venture capital fundraising  investment activity  and the volume of liquidity events were all down in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter in this downtrend precipitated from continued general macroeconomic instability and uncertainty and volatility in the public markets 
in  fewer exits by us venture backed companies netted more capital as the median price paid for an acquisition and the median amount raised during an ipo increased 
throughout  mergers  acquisitions  buyouts and ipos netted billion  a percent drop in deal activity and percent increase in capital raised compared with the difference in capital raised in ipos can largely be attributed to two companies that combined raised billion through their ipos 
thirty eight us venture capital funds raised billion in the fourth quarter of  according to thomson reuters and the national venture capital association 
this level marks a percent increase by dollar commitments  but a percent decline by number of funds compared with the third quarter of  which saw funds raise billion during the period 
this quarter marks the lowest number of funds raising money since the third quarter of us venture capital fundraising for all of totaled billion from funds  a percent increase by dollars compared with and with the same number of funds 
fundraising for all but the top tier venture capital funds continues to be difficult owing in part to the closely watched year benchmark for venture capital returns that stood at only percent as of september   which is the most recent data available for this statistic from cambridge associates  llc 
the current business environment is also complicated by global economic uncertainty and regional unrest 
it remains unclear if and how the debt crisis in europe will spread from greece  portugal  italy  ireland and spain to other countries in the region or beyond and whether it will result in a slowing of worldwide economic growth or even trigger a further global financial crisis 
it is unclear if the rising budget deficits in the united states will result in further downgrades in its credit rating 
any outcome could be heightened potentially should an alternative to us treasury securities emerge as the global safe haven for invested capital or should large holders of these securities  such as china  decide to divest of them in large quantities or in full 
it is unclear how regional unrest will affect the global economy should it persist and or expand beyond northern africa and the middle east 
all of this uncertainty could lead to a further broad reduction in risk taken by investors and corporations  which could reduce further the capital available to our portfolio companies  could affect the ability of our portfolio companies to build and grow their respective businesses  and could decrease the liquidity options available to our portfolio companies 
historically  difficult venture environments have resulted in a higher than normal number of companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding financing rounds 
this issue is compounded by the fact that many existing venture capital firms have few remaining years of investment and available capital owing to the finite lifetime of the funds managed by these firms 
additionally  even if a firm was able to raise a new fund  commonly venture capital firms are not permitted to invest new funds in existing investments 
this limitation of available capital can lead to fractured syndicates of investors 
a fractured syndicate can result in a portfolio company being unable to raise additional capital to fund operations 
this issue is especially acute in capital intensive sectors that are enabled by nanotechnology  such as energy  healthcare and electronics 
the portfolio company may be forced to sell before reaching its full potential or be shut down entirely if the remaining investors cannot financially support the company 
as such  improvements in the exit environment for venture backed companies through ipos and merger and acquisition transactions may not translate to an increase in the available capital to venture backed companies  particularly those that have investments from funds that are in the latter stage of life unless the markets improve for some time into the future 
our overall goal remains unchanged 
we want to maintain our leadership position in investing in nanotechnology and microsystems and to increase our net asset value 
the current environment for venture capital financings continues to favor those firms that have capital to invest regardless of the stage of the investee company 
we continue to finance our new and follow on equity and convertible debt investments from our cash reserves held in bank accounts 
we have historically held  and may in the future again hold  our cash that finances our operations in us treasury securities 
we believe the turmoil of the venture capital industry and the current economic climate provide opportunities to invest this capital at historically low valuations in equity and convertible debt securities and at high yields in non convertible debt securities of new and existing privately held and publicly traded companies of varying maturities 
valuation of investments we value our privately held venture capital investments each quarter as determined in good faith by our valuation committee  a committee of all the independent directors  within guidelines established by our board of directors in accordance with the act 
see footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in consolidated financial statements 
the values of privately held  venture capital backed companies are inherently more difficult than publicly traded companies to assess at any single point in time because securities of these types of companies are not actively traded 
we believe  perhaps even more than in the past  that illiquidity  and the perception of illiquidity  can affect value 
management believes further that the long term effects of the difficult venture capital market and difficult exit environments will continue to affect negatively the fundraising ability of weak companies regardless of near term improvements in the overall global economy and public markets  and that these factors can also affect value 
in each of the years in the period through  the company recorded the following gross write ups in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year boy  gross write downs in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year  and change in value of private portfolio securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year 
gross write ups and write downs of the privately held portfolio net asset value  boy    gross write downs during year   gross write ups during year    gross write downs as a percentage of net asset value  boy gross write ups as a percentage of net asset value  boy net change as a percentage of net asset value  boy from december   to december   the value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio  including our rights to potential future milestone payments from the sale of biovex to amgen increased by  from  to  this increase results primarily from new and follow on investments of  rights to milestone payments from amgen valued at  an increase in the net value of investments of  realized net gains of  and accrued net bridge note interest of  offset by a decrease of  in the unrealized value of investments owing to sales of certain investments 
net of the investments sold during the year  and not including our rights to potential future milestone payments from the sale of biovex to amgen  our equity focused portfolio companies increased in value by  this increase results primarily from new and follow on investments of  a net increase in value due to the terms and pricing of new rounds of financing of  a net increase due to valuations of publicly traded portfolio companies of  accrued bridge note interest of  and a net increase in currency fluctuations and warrant values of  offset by a net increase in discounts for non performance risk of  a decrease in the values of publicly traded comparable companies used to derive the value of one of our portfolio companies of  and repayment of a short term non convertible loan of  we note that our valuation committee and ultimately our board of directors take into account multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative inputs to determine the value of our privately held portfolio companies and our publicly traded portfolio companies whose values are not derived solely from the closing price on the last day of the quarter 
we also note that our valuation committee does not set the value of our freely tradable publicly traded portfolio companies  solazyme  inc  and neophotonics corporation 
even though our position in champions oncology  inc  is freely tradable as of december   subjective inputs are also included in the determination of value 
therefore  our valuation committee sets the value of this position 
non performance risk is the risk that a portfolio company will be a unable to raise capital  will need to be shut down and will not return our invested capital  or b able to raise capital  but at a valuation significantly lower than the implied post money valuation 
our best estimate of the non performance risk of our portfolio companies has been quantified and included in the valuation of the companies as of december   and this net estimate of  is the primary offset of the unrealized appreciation of our portfolio companies due to the terms and pricing of new rounds of financing that occurred during in the future  as these companies receive terms for additional financings or if they are unable to receive additional financing and  therefore  proceed with sales or shutdowns of the business  we expect the contribution of the discount for non performance risk to vary in importance in determining the values of our securities of these companies 
as of december   non performance risk was a significant factor in determining the values of of our equity focused portfolio companies that are fair valued by our board of directors 
these companies accounted for approximately million  or percent  of the total value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio  not including our rights to milestone payments from the sale of biovex to amgen 
as of december   non performance risk was a significant factor in determining the values of of our privately held equity focused  portfolio companies 
these companies accounted for million  or percent  of the total value of our privately held  equity focused venture capital portfolio 
we also note that our valuation of our securities of molecular imprints  inc  includes  that is ascribed to a non convertible bridge note 
the principal plus interest of this note was repaid in full in the third quarter of the remaining value results from a liquidation preference that survived the repayment of the note and  as currently written  would pay the company  should the company be sold for more than its outstanding debt and a contractual payment to management of molecular imprints 
this amount assumes that the total non convertible bridge note preferences are paid in full 
our value of this portion of our securities of molecular imprints as of december   reflects a probability weighted discount applied to the total amount of the preference 
as of december   our top ten investments by value accounted for approximately percent of the value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio 
assessment of venture capital investment portfolio as of december  as a foundational technology  nanotechnology is applicable across a diverse set of sectors  including energy  healthcare  and electronics 
we have built a portfolio of investments in each of these sectors comprised of companies that address today s growth markets and what we believe could be tomorrow s growth opportunities 
the value and cost of our equity focused portfolio is currently distributed among the three sectors as follows in the first quarter of  we renamed the sector classification electronics semiconductors to electronics and reclassified three companies  neophotonics corporation  polatis  inc  and xradia  inc  from a sector classification of other to electronics to reflect a broader definition of electronics to include photonics  metrology  and test and measurement 
we also renamed the sector classification healthcare biotech to healthcare 
in the fourth quarter of  we renamed cleantech to energy  a term that we believe encompasses cleantech related technologies and applications 
the chart below compares the values and numbers of companies that comprise our venture capital investments in our energy  healthcare and electronics portfolios as of december   and as of december  during  we sold our positions in four energy companies  two electronics companies and two healthcare companies 
we made new investments in one energy company  one electronics company and two healthcare companies 
we note that the value in healthcare as of december   does not include our rights to potential future milestone payments from the sale of biovex to amgen 
these rights were valued at  as of december   and were a part of the value of biovex prior to its sale to amgen of  as of december  we note that the amounts in healthcare and energy as of december   do not include the values of amounts held in escrow of   and  for the acquisitions of biovex  innovalight and crystal is  respectively 
we have and may continue to make investments outside these sectors  and we may not maintain these sectors or the weightings within these sectors in future quarters 
assessment of our energy portfolio as of december  we classify companies in our energy portfolio as those that seek to improve performance  productivity or efficiency  and to reduce environmental impact  waste  cost  energy consumption or raw materials using nanotechnology enabled solutions 
energy is a term used commonly to describe products and processes that solve global problems related to resource constraints 
the term  cleantech  is also used commonly in a similar manner 
we believe macroeconomic and microeconomic trends  including ongoing growth in consumption of energy and resources  energy security concerns and volatility of commodity prices  create attractive investment opportunities in energy 
we believe nanotechnology enables innovation in energy markets through new approaches to production nanotechnology enabled methods of production can enable lower energy use at lower cost and operate with better performance than current methods of production 
new materials new materials enable the development of new products that overcome inherent limitations of existing technology and processes 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within energy 
we have been early investors in many of these markets 
our initial investments in biofuels in solazyme  light emitting diodes in bridgelux and batteries in contour energy  represent three of our top ten investments by value 
solazyme completed a successful ipo in the second quarter of  raising over million 
bridgelux and contour energy achieved record revenue growth in all of these companies continue to make progress in their respective markets 
additionally  we believe the acquisition of innovalight by dupont in the third quarter of and crystal is by asahi kasei in the fourth quarter of provided validation of commercial interest in using nanoscale enabled inks to enhance the performance of solar cells and ultraviolet light emitting diodes for water purification  respectively 
we also believe we have a pipeline of companies that are developing solutions for growth markets that are emerging today or may develop in future years such as ground water and other environmental remediation absmaterials  renewable chemicals and fuels cobalt and alternative sources for high intensity light laser light engines 
we made one new energy investment in this initial investment made in the second quarter of was in a produced water remediation company  produced water absorbents  inc the table below shows the breakdown of our energy portfolio as of december   based on stage of maturity of the investment including the year of our initial investment in each of the companies 
many of our energy portfolio companies are generating commercial revenues and or have entered into partnerships and joint development agreements with large corporations 
we include some of the commercial developments from these portfolio companies during the fourth quarter below

we believe the macroeconomic and microeconomic dynamics that supported our thesis for historical investments in energy and the potential for nanotechnology to impact energy related markets will continue for the foreseeable future 
some of the market opportunities we are currently investigating for investment opportunities include energy efficiency  energy storage and new methods for production  extraction and purification of high value materials 
assessment of healthcare portfolio as of december  we classify companies in our healthcare portfolio as those that use nanotechnology to address problems in healthcare related industries  including biotechnology  pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
we believe macroeconomic and microeconomic trends  including an aging population  increasing life expectancy  increasing prosperity that drives efforts to extend life  the increased global reach of disease and the need to address exponential growth of expenses of entitlement programs in some wealthy countries  create attractive investment opportunities in healthcare 
we believe nanotechnology enables innovation in healthcare markets through engineering of biological systems the ability to study  optimize  and engineer biological systems at the nanoscale enables the use of biological systems for diagnosis and treatment of disease 
convergence of multiple disciplines much of the exciting work in nanotechnology is enabled by the convergence of the knowledge from multiple scientific disciplines 
this convergence enables advances in healthcare that could not otherwise occur within one discipline 
new tools complex biological processes include and are often the result of nanoscale phenomena 
the ability to study and interpret these processes requires new tools 
the information produced by these tools may advance the understanding and facilitate the engineering of biological systems 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within healthcare having been early investors in many of these markets 
we believe our initial investments in drug delivery vehicles in mersana  metabolomics in metabolon  synthetic carbohydrates in ancora  oncolytic viruses in biovex  which was acquired by amgen in and therapeutic discovery platforms in ensemble  positioned us well to capture the growth of commercial interest in cancer therapeutics  vaccines and molecular diagnostics 
mersana and amgen are in clinical trials with their respective treatments for cancer  and metabolon generated record revenue in and in additionally  we believe the acquisition of biovex by amgen on march   provided validation of commercial interest in the promise of oncolytic virus technology 
we also believe we have an emerging pipeline of companies that are developing solutions for growth markets that exist today or may develop in future years such as personalized medicine enumeral biomedical 
we made two new healthcare investments in we made an investment in a personalized medicine company  champions oncology  inc  in the second quarter of and an investment in a solid state ph meter company  senova systems  inc  in the third quarter of the table below shows the breakdown of our healthcare portfolio as of december   based on stage of maturity of the investment  including the year of our initial investment in each of the companies 
our healthcare companies demonstrate progress and growth through different mechanisms depending on their respective businesses 
businesses that provide services  such as metabolon  generate revenues from the commercial sale of these services 
businesses that enter into partnerships for discovery and development of therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostics may generate revenue from upfront fees  milestone payments and royalties on sales of approved products 
businesses that endeavor to advance a therapeutic  diagnostic or vaccine product through clinical trials may not generate revenue until an approved product is on the market  if ever 
progress for these types of companies can be measured by progress through clinical trials 
we include some of the developments from these portfolio companies during the fourth quarter below 
enumeral biomedical in december  enumeral s antibody discovery platform technology was featured in an article in xconomy 
com

new materials new materials enable unique capabilities  performance and form factors in electronic devices 
new forms of computation nanotechnology enables methods of solving equations and other problems that would be difficult or impossible with standard digital computing techniques 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within electronics having been early investors in many of these markets 
we believe our initial investments in non volatile memory in and nantero and adesto  respectively  transparent conductors in cambrios  image sensors in sionyx  integrated photonics in neophotonics and metrology in xradia  positioned us well to capture the growth of commercial interest in smartphones and tablet computers with touchscreens  the exponential increase in demand for bandwidth for data and telecommunications and the demand for non destructive imaging capabilities in a variety of industries 
we also believe we have an emerging pipeline of companies that are developing solutions for growth markets that exist today or may develop in future years such as high performance computing enabled by quantum mechanics d wave systems and radio frequency identification and near field communication devices enabled by printed electronics kovio 
we made one new electronics investment in this initial investment was in an electronic water proofing technology company  hzo  inc  in the third quarter of the table below shows the breakdown of our electronics portfolio as of december   based on stage of maturity of the investment  including the year of our initial investment in each of the companies 
many of our electronics portfolio companies are generating commercial revenues and or have entered into partnerships and joint development agreements with large corporations

sionyx in november  sionyx won a million contract from the department of defense to help develop next generation laser targeting systems for tactical imaging systems 
we believe the macroeconomic and microeconomic dynamics that supported our thesis for historical investments in electronics and the potential for nanotechnology to impact electronics related markets will continue for the foreseeable future  albeit with some adjustment 
the high capital intensity of traditional semiconductor investments and the reduced values placed on these companies at exit in the current market environment have resulted in these investments becoming less favorable to investors  including ourselves 
we are currently investigating opportunities that do not require such substantial capital investment to reach commercial revenues and breakeven cash flow 
our new electronics portfolio company  hzo  inc  is an example of such an opportunity 
results of operations we present the financial results of our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance during any period is the net increase decrease in our net assets resulting from our operating activities  which is the sum of the following three elements net operating income loss the difference between our income from interest  dividends  and fees and our operating expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments the difference between the net proceeds of sales of portfolio securities and their stated cost  plus income from interests in limited liability companies 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments the net unrealized change in the value of our investment portfolio 
owing to the structure and objectives of our business  we generally expect to experience net operating losses and seek to generate increases in our net assets from operations through the long term appreciation and monetization of our venture capital investments 
we have relied  and continue to rely  primarily on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses 
because such sales are unpredictable  we attempt to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales 
during  we made three venture debt investments 
while the interest income generated from these investments did not defray a significant portion of our operating expenses in  further investments in venture debt could generate more substantial investment income in future years 
the potential for  or occurrence of  inflation could result in rising interest rates for government backed debt 
this trend would have two effects on our business 
first  the spread between the interest rates we can obtain from investing low risk government debt versus high risk venture debt will compress  which would result in a reduction of the risk premium associated with investments in venture debt 
we may reduce the number and amount invested in venture debt should this risk premium decrease substantially as to not compensate us adequately for the risk associated with such investments 
second  funds drawn from our line of credit will accrue interest at a rate that fluctuates with the london interbank offered rate libor 
libor is expected to increase in times of inflation 
our venture debt investments may include both fixed and floating interest rates 
our interest income would decrease if the spread between the interest rate on funds from our line of credit and our venture debt investments decrease 
comparison of years ended december    and during the year ended december   we had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of  during the year ended december   we had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of  during the year ended december   we had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of  investment income and expenses during the years ended december    and  we had net operating losses of   and  respectively

we decreased our average holdings of us government securities and ended with no holdings of us government securities primarily due to the decrease in yield available over the durations of maturities in which we were willing to invest and the availability of fully fdic insured demand deposit bank accounts 
operating expenses  including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  were  and  for the twelve months ended december   and december   respectively 
the increase in operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   as compared with the twelve months ended december   was primarily owing to increases in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense  administration and operations expense and professional fees  offset by decreases in rent expense and custody fees 
salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense increased by  or percent  through december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of an increase of  in the projected benefit obligation expense accrual for medical retirement benefits and an increase in year end employee bonuses of  offset by a decrease in non cash expense of  associated with the stock plan and a decrease in salaries and benefits owing primarily to a decrease in our head count

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources are generated and are generally available through our cash holdings  interest earned on our investments on us government securities  cash flows from the sales of us government securities and payments received on our venture debt investments  proceeds from periodic follow on equity offerings and realized capital gains retained for reinvestment 
as of december   we did not hold any us government securities and funded all of our operations from cash held in bank accounts 
we fund our day to day operations using interest earned and proceeds from our cash holdings  the sales of our investments in us government securities  when applicable  and interest earned from our venture debt securities 
we believe the increase or decrease in the value of our venture capital investments does not materially affect the day to day operations of the company or our daily liquidity 
as of december   and december   we had no investments in money market mutual funds 
we have a million three year revolving credit facility with td bank  na this credit facility is used to fund our venture debt investments and not for the payment of day to day operating expenses 
as of december   we had debt outstanding of  which is approximately one percent of our net assets 
this debt is collateralized with cash held in a restricted account on a one for one basis with the amount of debt outstanding from the credit facility 
therefore  repayment of the outstanding debt as of december   would not have a significant impact on our daily liquidity 
we have not issued any debt securities  and  therefore  are not subject to credit agency downgrades 
as a venture capital company  it is critical that we have capital available to support our best companies until we have an opportunity for liquidity in our investments 
as such  we will continue to maintain a substantial amount of liquid capital on our balance sheet 
however  to complement our equity focused portfolio investing  we seek to invest some of this capital in venture debt where we will have more defined investment return timelines than we currently have in our existing portfolio 
in addition  we may from time to time opt to borrow money to make investments  specifically in debt securities that generate cash flow and have a known timeframe for return on investment 
except for a rights offering  we are also generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below our net asset value per share  exclusive of any distributing commission or discount  without shareholder approval 
as of december   our net asset value was per share and our closing market price was per share 
we do not currently have shareholder approval to issue or sell shares below our net asset value per share 
december  at december   and december   our total net primary and secondary liquidity was  and  respectively 
at december   and december   our total net primary liquidity was  and  respectively 
our primary liquidity is principally comprised of our cash  us government securities  when applicable  and certain receivables 
the decrease in our primary liquidity from december   to december   is primarily owing to the use of funds for investments and payment of net operating expenses  offset by the proceeds received from the sale of investments 
at december   and december   our secondary liquidity was  and  respectively 
our secondary liquidity consists of our publicly traded securities 
although these companies are publicly traded  their stock may not trade at high volumes and prices can be volatile  which may restrict our ability to sell our positions at any given time 
we may also be restricted for a period of time in selling our positions in these companies due to our shares being unregistered 
as of december   none of our publicly traded securities were restricted from sale 
we do not include funds held in escrow from the sale of investments in primary or secondary liquidity 
these funds will become primary liquidity if and when they are received at the expiration of the escrow period 
we believe that the difficult venture capital environment may continue to adversely affect the valuation of investment portfolios  tighter lending standards and reduced access to capital 
these conditions may lead to a further decline in net asset value and or decline in valuations of our portfolio companies 
although we cannot predict future market conditions  we continue to believe that our current cash and our ability to adjust our investment pace will provide us with adequate liquidity to execute our current business strategy

our secondary liquidity consists of our publicly traded securities 
although these companies are publicly traded  their stock may not trade at high volumes and prices can be volatile  or our stock may be subject to restrictions on transfer  such as lock up provisions  which may restrict our ability to sell our positions at any given time 
borrowings on february   we established a million three year revolving credit facility with td bank  na  to be used in conjunction with our venture debt investments 
the credit facility  among other things  matures on february   and generally bears interest  at the company s option  based on i libor plus percent or the higher of the federal funds rate plus fifty basis points percent or the us prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
the credit facility generally requires payment of interest on a monthly basis and requires the payment of a non use fee of percent annually 
all outstanding principal is due upon maturity 
the credit facility is secured by cash collateral to be held in a non interest bearing account at td bank 
the credit facility contains affirmative and restrictive covenants  including a periodic financial reporting requirements  b maintaining our status as a bdc c maintaining unencumbered  liquid assets of not less than  d limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  e limitations on liens  and f limitations on mergers and dissolutions 
the credit facility is used to supplement our capital to make additional venture debt investments 
the company s outstanding debt balance was  at december  the annual weighted average interest cost for the twelve months ended december   was percent  exclusive of amortization of closing fees and other expenses related to establishing the credit facility 
the remaining capacity under the credit facility was  at december  at december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants required by the credit facility 
contractual obligations a summary of our significant contractual payment obligations is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years revolving credit facility   operating leases    as of december   we had  of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the footnote to the consolidated schedule of investments 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical valuation of portfolio investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
as a bdc  we invest in primarily illiquid securities that generally have no established trading market 
investments are stated at value as defined in the act and in the applicable regulations of the sec and us gaap 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability based upon the best available information 
see note investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii the fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments 
as of december   our financial statements include venture capital investments valued at  the fair values of which were determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors 
as of december   approximately percent of our net assets represent investments in portfolio companies at fair value by the board of directors 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  the assessment of non performance risk  the achievement of milestones  discounts for restrictions on transfers of publicly traded securities  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
historically  difficult venture capital environments have resulted in companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss of investment to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding rounds  leading to very deep dilution for those who do not participate in the new rounds of investment 
our best estimate of this non performance risk has been quantified and included in the valuation of our portfolio companies as of december  all investments recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets  are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
as of december   over percent of our portfolio company investments were classified as level in the hierarchy  indicating a high level of judgment required in their valuation 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
stock based compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant requires judgment 
historically  we have used the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
management uses the black scholes merton option pricing model in instances where we lack historical data necessary for more complex models and when the share award terms can be valued within the model 
other models may yield fair values that are significantly different from those calculated by the black scholes merton option pricing model 
management uses a binomial lattice option pricing model in instances where it is necessary to include a broader array of assumptions 
we used the binomial lattice model for the year nqsos granted on march  these awards included accelerated vesting provisions that were based on market conditions 
option pricing models require the use of subjective input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
variations in the expected volatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value 
as the volatility or expected term assumptions increase  the fair value of the stock option increases 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
a higher assumed dividend rate yields a lower fair value  whereas higher assumed interest rates yield higher fair values for stock options 
in the black scholes merton model  we use the simplified calculation of expected term as described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin because of the lack of historical information about option exercise patterns 
in the binomial lattice model  we use an expected term that assumes the options will be exercised at two times the strike price because of the lack of option exercise patterns 
future exercise behavior could be materially different than that which is assumed by the model 
expected volatility is based on the historical fluctuations in the company s stock 
the company s stock has historically been volatile  which increases the fair value of the underlying share based awards 
gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited owing to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after the grant date is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
such adjustments would affect our operating expenses and additional paid in capital  but would have no effect on our net asset value 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions the company provides a retiree medical benefit plan for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
until it was terminated on may   the company also provided an executive mandatory retirement benefit plan for certain individuals employed by us in a bona fide executive or high policy making position 
our former president accrued benefits under this plan prior to his retirement  and the termination of the plan has no impact on his accrued benefits 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability values related to our post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about the discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs  and mortality  among others 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the post retirement medical benefit and pension liabilities could be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments for plan participants 
in estimating this rate  we consider the citigroup pension liability index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we utilized to measure our post retirement medical benefit obligation as of december   and to calculate our expense was percent 
we used a discount rate of percent to calculate our pension obligation for the executive mandatory retirement benefit plan

also in the first quarter of  three of our companies have commenced planning for and or began the process of hiring bankers to pursue potential sales and or ipos of those companies 
as of march   these efforts are ongoing  and there can be no assurance that either of these companies will be able to consummate either type of transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
although we are risk seeking rather than risk averse in our investments  we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business 
valuation risk value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which market quotations are readily available and ii fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see the valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
because there is typically no public market for our interests in the privately held small businesses in which we invest  the valuation of the equity interests in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our board of directors with the assistance of our valuation committee  comprised of the independent members of our board of directors  in accordance with our valuation procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the determined value of our portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  readily available public market quotations  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  the achievement of milestones  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments 
changes in valuation of any of our investments in privately held companies from one period to another may be volatile 
investments in privately held  immature companies are inherently more volatile than investments in more mature businesses 
such immature businesses are inherently fragile and easily affected by both internal and external forces 
our investee companies can lose much or all of their value suddenly in response to an internal or external adverse event 
conversely  these immature businesses can gain suddenly in value in response to an internal or external positive development 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be different from what is presently estimated 
this difference could be material 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we intend to fund a portion of our venture debt investments with borrowings  our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
our borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  based on either a libor plus percent or the higher of the federal funds rate plus basis points or the us prime rate 
the interest rates are fixed for the interest period selected 
however  these interest periods renew approximately every three months 
therefore  variations in interest rates affect the rates at which we can borrow and may increase our interest expense during any given period 
in the future  some of our venture debt investments may be at variable rates 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in future quarters 
we generally also invest in both short and long term us government and agency securities 
to the extent that we invest in short and long term us government and agency securities  changes in interest rates result in changes in the value of these obligations that result in an increase or decrease of our net asset value 
the level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment  the expectations of future price and market movements  and the quantity and duration of long term us government and agency securities held by the company  and it will vary from period to period 
we did not hold us government securities at december  in addition  market interest rates for high yield corporate debt are an input in determining value of our investments in debt securities of privately held and publicly traded companies 
significant changes in these market rates could affect the value of our debt securities as of the date of measurement of value 
our investment income could be adversely affected should such debt securities include floating interest rates 
we do not currently have any investments in debt securities with floating interest rates 
foreign currency risk most of our investments are denominated in us dollars 
we currently have one investment denominated in canadian dollars 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value on this investment resulting from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is  at december
