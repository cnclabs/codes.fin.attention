item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand choice hotels international  inc and its subsidiaries together the company 
md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview we are a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements representing  hotels open and hotels under construction  awaiting conversion or approved for development as of december   with  rooms and  rooms  respectively  in states  the district of columbia and over countries and territories outside the united states 
our brand names include comfort inn  comfort suites  quality  clarion  ascend collection  sleep inn  econo lodge  rodeway inn  mainstay suites  suburban extended stay hotel and cambria suites collectively  the choice brands 
the company s domestic operations are conducted solely through direct franchising relationships while its international franchise operations are conducted through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships 
master 
table of contents franchising relationships are governed by master franchising agreements which generally provide the master franchisee with the right to use our brands in a specific geographic region  usually for a fee 
our business philosophy has been to conduct direct franchising in those international markets where both franchising is an accepted business model and we believe our brands can achieve significant distribution 
we elect to enter into master franchise agreements in those markets where direct franchising is currently not a prevalent or viable business model 
when entering into master franchising relationships  we strive to select partners that have professional hotel and asset management capabilities together with the financial capacity to invest in building the choice brands in their respective markets 
master franchising relationships typically provide lower revenues to the company as the master franchisees are responsible for managing certain necessary services such as training  quality assurance  reservations and marketing to support the franchised hotels in the master franchise area and therefore retain a larger percentage of the hotel franchise fees to cover their expenses 
in certain circumstances  the company has and may continue to make equity investments in our master franchisees 
as a result of our use of master franchising relationships and international market conditions  total revenues from international franchising operations comprised and of our total revenues in and  respectively while representing approximately of our franchise system hotels open at both december  and therefore  our description of the franchise system is primarily focused on the domestic operations 
the company previously had a equity interest in choice hospitality india ltd 
chn which it accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
on january   the company purchased the remaining of chn at which time it became a wholly owned subsidiary 
the pro forma results of operations as if chn had been combined at the beginning of all periods presented  would not be materially different from the company s reported results for those periods 
this transaction enabled choice to continue its strategy of more closely directing the growth of our international franchise operations our company generates revenues  income and cash flows primarily from initial  relicensing and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements 
revenues are also generated from qualified vendor arrangements  hotel operations and other sources 
the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
for most hotels  demand is lower in december through march than during the remainder of the year 
our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties 
the company s franchise fee revenues and operating income reflect the industry s seasonality and historically have been lower in the first quarter than in the second  third or fourth quarters 
with a focus on hotel franchising instead of ownership  we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business 
the fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial and relicensing fee revenue  ongoing royalty fees and procurement services revenues 
in addition  our operating results can also be improved through our company wide efforts related to improving property level performance 
at december  the company estimates  based on its current domestic portfolio of hotels under franchise  that a change in revenue per available room revpar or rooms under franchise would increase or decrease royalty revenues by approximately million and a basis point change in the company s effective royalty rate would increase or decrease domestic royalties by approximately million 
in addition to these revenues  we also collect marketing and reservation system fees to support centralized marketing and reservation activities for the franchise system 
as a lodging franchisor  choice currently has relatively low capital expenditure requirements 
the principal factors that affect the company s results are the number and relative mix of franchised hotel rooms in the various hotel lodging price categories  growth in the number of hotel rooms under franchise  occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise  the effective royalty rate achieved  the level of franchise sales and relicensing activity  and our ability to manage costs 
the number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues at franchised hotels 
the key industry standard for measuring hotel operating performance is revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized 
our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth of our established brands have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises 
accordingly  continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results 
we are required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system wide marketing and reservation activities 
these expenditures  which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central reservations system  help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in business delivery to our franchisees  which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the company 
our company articulates its mission as a commitment to our franchisees profitability by providing our franchisees with 
table of contents hotel franchises that strive to generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners 
we believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value for our shareholders 
our company focuses on two key value drivers profitable growth 
our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels  increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises  effective royalty rate improvement and maintaining a disciplined cost structure 
we attempt to improve our franchisees revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees 
these products and services include national marketing campaigns  a central reservation system  property and yield management systems  quality assurance standards and qualified vendor relationships 
we believe that healthy brands  which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees  will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises and raise royalty rates 
we have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests  and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels 
this ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions 
improving the performance of the hotels under franchise  growing the system through additional franchise sales and improving franchise agreement pricing while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth 
maximizing financial returns and creating value for shareholders 
our capital allocation decisions  including capital structure and uses of capital  are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders 
we believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage 
currently  our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow 
therefore  we can maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders 
historically  we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways share repurchases and dividends 
in  we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders 
during the year ended december   the company purchased million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase program at an average price of for a total cost of million 
through december   we have repurchased million shares including million prior to the two for one stock split affected in october of common stock at a total cost of billion since the program s inception 
considering the effect of the two for one stock split  the company has repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations will support our ability to complete the repurchase of approximately million shares remaining as of december  under the current stock repurchase authorization of the board of directors 
upon completion of the current authorization  our board of directors will evaluate the advisability of additional share repurchases 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends totaling approximately million and we presently expect to continue to pay dividends in the future  subject to business performance  economic conditions  changes in income tax regulations and other factors 
based on our present dividend rate and outstanding share count  aggregate annual dividends for would be approximately million 
our board of directors previously authorized us to enter into programs which permit us to offer investment  financing and guaranty support to qualified franchisees as well as acquire and resell real estate to incent franchise development for certain brands in strategic markets 
recent market conditions have resulted in an increase in opportunities to incentivize development under these programs and as a result over the next several years  we expect to deploy capital opportunistically pursuant to these programs to promote growth of our emerging brands 
the amount and timing of the investment in these programs will be dependent on market and other conditions 
our current expectation is that our annual investment in these programs will range from million to million 
notwithstanding these programs  the company expects to continue to return value to its shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  subject to business performance  economic conditions  changes in income tax regulations and other factors 
we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will enhance our profitability  maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operation royalty fees  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share eps represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  royalty fees revenue totaled approximately million  a increase from operating income totaled million for the year ended december   a increase from net income for the year ended december  increased million to million and diluted eps were compared to for the year ended december  these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 

table of contents refer to md a heading operations review for additional analysis of our results 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has generated significant cash flows from operations 
in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
since our business does not currently require significant reinvestment of capital  we typically utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends 
however  we may determine to utilize more cash for acquisitions and other investments in the future 
we believe the company s cash flow from operations and available financing capacity is sufficient to meet the expected future operating  investing and financing needs of the business

operations review comparison of and operating results the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   a million or increase from the year ended december  the increase in net income for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a million or increase in operating income and a lower effective income tax rate than the prior year 
these items were partially offset by an million increase in other income and expenses  net primarily due to a million increase in interest expense due to higher effective borrowing rates on the fixed rate long term debt issued in the third quarter of  a million decline in the fair value of investments held in the company s non qualified benefit plans compared to a million appreciation in the fair value of these investments in the prior year period and the recording of a million loss on assets held for sale

the company s calculation of these measurements may be different from the calculations used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited 
we have included a reconciliation of these measures to the comparable gaap measurement below as well as our reasons for reporting these non gaap measures 
franchising revenues the company utilizes franchising revenues  which exclude marketing and reservation system revenues  and hotel operations rather than total revenues when analyzing the performance of the business 
revenues from marketing and reservation activities are excluded because the company is contractually required by its franchise agreements to use these revenues for marketing and reservation activities  as such  no income or loss to the company is generated 
cumulative marketing and reservation system fees not expended are recorded as a payable on the company s financial statements and are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
cumulative marketing and reservation expenditures in excess of fees collected for marketing and reservation activities are recorded as a receivable on the company s financial statements 
revenues from hotel operations are excluded because they do not reflect the most accurate measure of the company s core franchising business 
this non gaap measure is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry and facilitates comparisons between the company and its competitors

gross domestic additions for conversion hotels during the year ended december  declined by from hotels during the year ended december  to hotels 
the decline in hotel openings is primarily due to the limited availability of hotel construction financing which has significantly impacted the number of new construction hotel franchise agreements executed as well as the ability of existing projects to obtain financing and commence construction 
in addition  a decline in the real estate market for hotel transactions and retention efforts implemented by other hotel brand companies have negatively impacted the company s pipeline of new franchises

marketing and reservations the company s franchise agreements require the payment of franchise fees  which include marketing and reservation system fees

table of contents as of december  and  the company s balance sheet includes a receivable of million and million  respectively resulting from cumulative marketing and reservation expenses incurred in excess of cumulative system fee revenues earned 
these receivables are recorded as an asset in the financial statements as the company has the contractual authority to require that the franchisees in the system at any given point repay the company for any deficits related to marketing and reservations activities 
the company s current franchisees are legally obligated to pay any assessment the company imposes on its franchisees to obtain reimbursement of such deficit regardless of whether those constituents continue to generate gross room revenue and whether or not they joined the system following the deficit s occurrence 
the company has no present intention to accelerate repayment of the deficit from current franchisees 
our ability to recover these receivables may be adversely impacted by certain factors  including  among others  declines in the ability of our franchisees to generate revenues at properties they franchise from us  lower than expected franchise system growth of certain brands and or lower than expected international franchise system growth 
an extended period of occupancy or room rate declines or a decline in the number of hotel rooms in our franchise system could result in the generation of insufficient funds to recover marketing and reservation advances as well as meet the ongoing marketing and reservation needs of the overall system

critical accounting policies our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application 
additional discussion of these policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize continuing franchise fees  including royalty  marketing and reservations system fees  when earned and receivable from our franchisees 
franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchisee 
our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to sg a expense and our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible marketing and reservation system fees is charged to marketing and reservation expenses 
initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized  in most instances  in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise and relicensing fees are non refundable and the company is not required to provide initial services to the franchisee prior to hotel opening 
we defer the initial franchise and relicensing fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated  whichever occurs first 

table of contents the company may also enter into master development agreements mdas with developers that grant limited exclusive development rights and preferential franchise agreement terms for one time  non refundable fees 
when these fees are not contingent upon the number of agreements executed under the mda  the company recognizes the up front fees over the mda s contractual life 
fees that are contingent upon the execution of franchise agreements under the mda are recognized upon execution of the franchise agreement 
the company recognizes procurement services revenues from qualified vendors when the services are performed or the product delivered  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
we defer the recognition of procurement services revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the company s estimate of the life of the arrangement 
marketing and reservation revenues and expenses 
the company s franchise agreements require the payment of certain marketing and reservation system fees  which are used exclusively by the company for expenses associated with providing franchise services such as national marketing  media advertising  central reservation systems and technology services 
the company is contractually obligated to expend the marketing and reservation system fees it collects from franchisees in accordance with the franchise agreements  as such  no income or loss to the company is generated 
in accordance with our contracts  we include in marketing and reservation expenses an allocation of costs for certain activities  such as human resources  facilities  legal  accounting  etc  required to carry out marketing and reservation activities 
the company records marketing and reservation revenues and expenses on a gross basis since the company is the primary obligor in the arrangement  maintains the credit risk  establishes the price and nature of the marketing or reservation services and retains discretion in supplier selection 
in addition  net advances to and repayments from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities 
marketing and reservation system fees not expended in the current year are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
shortfall amounts are similarly recovered in subsequent years 
cumulative excess or shortfall amounts from the operation of these programs are recorded as a marketing and reservation system fee payable or receivable 
under the terms of the franchise agreements  the company may advance capital as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees 
our current assessment is that the credit risk associated with the marketing and reservation system fees receivable is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically dispersed group of franchisees 
however  our ability to recover these receivables may be adversely impacted by certain factors  including  among others  declines in the ability of our franchisees to generate revenues at properties they franchise from us  lower than expected franchise system growth of certain brands and or lower than expected international franchise system growth 
an extended period of occupancy or room rate declines or a decline in the number of hotel rooms in our franchise system could result in the generation of insufficient funds to recover marketing and reservation advances as well as meet the ongoing marketing and reservation needs of the overall system 
the company evaluates the receivable for marketing and reservation costs in excess of cumulative marketing and reservation system fees earned on a periodic basis for collectability 
the company will record an allowance when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for marketing and reservation activities according to the contractual terms of the franchise agreements 
the receivables are considered to be uncollectible if the expected net  undiscounted cash flows from marketing and reservation activities are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
choice privileges is our frequent guest incentive marketing program 
choice privileges enables members to earn points based on their spending levels with our franchisees and  to a lesser degree  through participation in affiliated partners programs  such as those offered by credit card companies 
the points  which we accumulate and track on the members behalf  may be redeemed for free accommodations or other benefits 
we provide choice privileges as a marketing program to franchised hotels and collect a percentage of program members room revenue from franchises to operate the program 
revenues are deferred in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the future redemption obligation 
a third party actuary estimates the eventual redemption rates and point values using various actuarial methods 
these judgmental factors determine the required liability attributable to outstanding points 
upon redemption of points  the company recognizes the previously deferred revenue as well as the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 
revenues in excess of the estimated future redemption obligation are recognized when earned to reimburse the company for costs incurred to operate the program  including administrative costs  marketing  promotion and performing member services 
costs to operate the program  excluding estimated redemption values  are expensed when incurred 

table of contents valuation of intangibles and long lived assets the company evaluates the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including franchise rights and other definite lived intangibles  on an annual basis or whenever an event or other circumstances indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset 
recoverability is measured based on net  undiscounted expected cash flows 
assets are considered to be impaired if the net  undiscounted expected cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
impairment charges are recorded based upon the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
significant management judgment is involved in developing these projections  and they include inherent uncertainties 
if different projections are used in the current period  the balances for non current assets could be materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
the company evaluates the impairment of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives on an annual basis  or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
since the company has one reporting unit  the fair value of the company s net assets is used to determine if goodwill may be impaired 
indefinite life trademarks are considered to be impaired if the net  undiscounted expected cash flows associated with the trademark are less than their carrying amount 
loan loss reserves the company segregates its notes receivable for the purposes of evaluating allowances for credit losses between two categories mezzanine and other notes receivable and forgivable notes receivable 
the company utilizes the level of security it has in the various notes receivable as its primary credit quality indicator ie senior  subordinated or unsecured when determining the appropriate allowances for uncollectible loans within these categories 
mezzanine  and other notes receivables the company has provided financing to franchisees in support of the development of properties in key markets 
the company expects the owners to repay the loans in accordance with the loan agreements  or earlier as the hotels mature and capital markets permit 
the company estimates the collectability and records an allowance for loss on its mezzanine and other notes receivable when recording the receivables in the company s financial statements 
these estimates are updated quarterly based on available information 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement 
the company measures loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral 
for impaired loans  the company establishes a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral 
the company applies its loan impairment policy individually to all mezzanine and other notes receivable in the portfolio and does not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy 
for impaired loans  the company recognizes interest income on a cash basis 
if it is likely that a loan will not be collected based on financial or other business indicators it is the company s policy to charge off these loans to sg a expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the quarter when it is deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of sg a expenses in the quarter received 
the company assesses the collectability of its senior notes receivable by comparing the market value of the underlying assets to the carrying value of the outstanding notes 
in addition  the company evaluates the property s operating performance  the borrower s compliance with the terms of the loan and franchise agreements  and all related personal guarantees that have been provided by the borrower 
for subordinated or unsecured receivables  the company assesses the property s operating performance  the subordinated equity available to the company  the borrower s compliance with the terms of loan and franchise agreements  and the related personal guarantees that have been provided by the borrower 
the company considers loans to be past due and in default when payments are not made when due 
although the company considers loans to be in default if payments are not received on the due date  the company does not suspend the accrual of interest until those payments are more than days past due 
the company applies payments received for loans on non accrual status first to interest and then principal 
the company does not resume interest accrual until all delinquent payments are received 
forgivable notes receivable 
table of contents in certain instances  the company may provide financing to franchisees for property improvements and other purposes in the form of forgivable promissory notes which bear interest at market rates 
under these promissory notes  the franchisee promises to repay the principal sum together with interest upon maturity unless certain conditions are met throughout the term of the promissory note 
the principal sum and related interest are forgiven ratably over the term of the promissory note if the franchisee remains in the system in good standing 
if during the term of the promissory note  the franchisee exits our franchise system or is not operating their franchise in accordance with our quality or credit standards  the company may declare a default under the promissory note and commence collection efforts with respect to the full amount of the then current outstanding principal and interest 
in accordance with the terms of the promissory notes  the initial principal sum and related interest are ratably reduced over the term of the loan on each anniversary date until the outstanding amounts are reduced to zero as long as the franchisee remains within the franchise system and operates in accordance with our quality and brand standards 
as a result  the amounts recorded as an asset on the company s consolidated balance sheet are also ratably reduced since the amounts forgiven no longer represent probable future economic benefits to the company 
the company records the reduction of its recorded assets through amortization expense on its consolidated statements of income 
the company fully reserves all defaulted notes in addition to recording a reserve on the estimated uncollectible portion of the remaining notes 
for those notes not in default  the company calculates an allowance for losses and determines the ultimate collectability on these forgivable notes based on the historical default rates for those unsecured notes that are not forgiven but are required to be repaid 
the company records bad debt expense in sg a expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the quarter when the note is deemed uncollectible 
see note notes receivable for additional information 
stock compensation 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost related to share based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation expense related to the fair value of share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on an estimate of those awards that will ultimately vest 
the company estimates the share based compensation expense for awards that will ultimately vest upon inception of the grant and adjusts the estimate of share based compensation for those awards with performance and or service requirements that will not be satisfied so that compensation cost is recognized only for awards that ultimately vest 
income taxes 
income taxes are recorded using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will be unrealized 
deferred united states income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates 
the temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently reinvested in operations outside the united states if management s intentions change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided 
with respect to uncertain income tax positions  a tax liability is recorded in full when management determines that the position does not meet the more likely than not threshold of being sustained on examination
