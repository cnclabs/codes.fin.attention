overview this overview is not a complete discussion of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the detailed discussion and analysis that follows and must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the company s financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of products and services that purify  protect and transport the critical materials used in key technology driven industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and related industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers as well as thin film transistor liquid crystal display tft lcd and hard disk manufacturers  which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia  europe and the middle east 

table of contents the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that it believes provide the most comprehensive offering of contamination control solutions and microenvironment products and services to the microelectronics industry 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth  while others rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable products includes membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters  resin based gas purifiers  wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch  ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing 
the company s capital expense driven products include components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes  and process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a significant portion of the company s product costs except for raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short to medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to the effects of industry cyclicality  technological change  substantial competition  pricing pressures and foreign currency fluctuation 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially polymers  stainless steel and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
fixed cost structure 
the company s operations include a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  facility costs  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
accordingly  increases or decreases in sales volume can have a large effect on the usage and productivity of these cost components  resulting in a large impact on the company s profitability 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  the company s financial results for the year ended december  reflected the continued recovery of global economic conditions and  more specifically  the improvement in both the capital and unit driven segments of the semiconductor industry that began during the second half of from a low point of million in the first quarter of  quarterly sales of the company s products and services rose steadily on a sequential basis  reaching million in the second quarter of  before declining over the latter half of due to a slowdown in semiconductor industry capital spending and sluggish production rates 
total net sales for the year ended december  were million  up million  or  from sales of million for the year ended december  sales growth in reflected generally positive trends in the company s core semiconductor markets  for both the company s unit driven and capital driven products lines 
two of the company s three operating segments experienced net sales increases  while the other operating segment s net sales were flat 
the sales increase in included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million related to the year over year strengthening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the japanese yen  korean won  singaporean dollar  euro and taiwanese dollar 
excluding these factors  net sales rose approximately in when compared to 
table of contents the year over year sales increase  along with a slight improvement in sales mix  accounted for higher gross profits in these factors were offset by reduced levels of factory utilization  underlying a gross margin rate for of compared to a year ago 
operating costs  consisting of selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering  research and development er d costs  fell nominally for the year ended december  when compared to the year ago period 
as a result of the factors noted above  net income attributable to the company for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income attributable to the company of million  or per diluted share  in during  the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared with million at december  the company had no outstanding short term bank borrowings or long term debt at december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  this could result in material differences in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
in addition  for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances  historical bad debt write off experience and current economic circumstances 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical and current trends in both sales and product returns 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value its inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities each quarter 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and historical and projected sales levels by 
table of contents product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full allowance is recorded 
in addition  allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions or the company s projected outlook for sales  additional inventory write downs or allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of net property  plant and equipment and million of net intangible assets 
the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of the value of its long lived assets  particularly its manufacturing equipment  and its intangible assets  are present 
a long lived asset asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances a 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group b 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator d 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group e 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group f 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group in question is less than its carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its respective fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the asset groups determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the fair value attributable to the asset group is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company s long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level asset groups for which the identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
the company has four significant asset groups  identified by assessing the company s identifiable cash flows and the interdependence of such cash flows contamination control solutions ccs  microenvironments me  poco graphite poco and entegris specialty coatings esc 
as described above  the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows  the primary asset of the group and long range forecasts of revenue and costs  reflecting management s assessment of general economic and industry conditions  operating income  depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 

table of contents due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
based on improved economic conditions within the semiconductor industry and the absence of any other triggering events  the company has not been required to perform impairment testing for any of its asset groups since the first quarter of the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events to determine whether asset impairment testing is warranted 
it is possible that in the future the company may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of its long lived assets  nor can the company provide assurance that material impairment charges of long lived assets will not occur in future periods 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments in its determination of income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
management considers the positive and negative evidence for the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets 
when management concludes that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets in the future  it records a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
the company had us gross deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively  which comprises temporary differences and various credit carryforwards 
at each date  management reviewed its us deferred tax assets and concluded when it is not more likely than not that the company would realize certain deferred tax assets 
at december   the company determined based upon the positive evidence of cumulative three year income and the projected utilization of the company s foreign tax credits within the carry forward period  it was more likely than not that the majority of the us net deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  the company released the valuation allowance on all but million of its us deferred tax assets 
at december   the negative evidence of a cumulative three year us operating loss and a finite carryforward period for the company s us foreign tax credits was sufficiently significant to outweigh all identified positive evidence 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to us deferred tax assets 
the company had gross non us deferred tax asset positions before valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
at those dates  management determined that based upon the available evidence  a valuation allowance was required against certain non us deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to certain non us deferred tax assets 
for other non us jurisdictions  principally japan  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as management expects sufficient future earnings in those jurisdictions 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 

table of contents share based compensation u 
s generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company estimates the value of stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience and current expectations 
if the above factors change  and the company uses different assumptions in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

the company s three operating segments experienced mixed sales results 
see the segment analysis included below in this section for additional detail 

table of contents the sales increase in included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million related to the year over year strengthening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the japanese yen  korean won  singaporean dollar  euro and taiwanese dollar 
excluding these factors  net sales rose approximately in when compared to on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in when comparing to  all regions experienced year over year sales increases 
net sales to customers in north america  asia  europe  and japan increased    and  respectively  from to a portion of the asia  europe  and japan increases related to favorable foreign currency translation effects 
net of favorable currency translation effects  sales increased   and for asia  europe  and japan  respectively 
demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication equipment and facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in increased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for sales of unit driven products increased in unit driven products generally have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  specialized graphite components  and wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below 
year over year sales of capital driven products increased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
the company believes the sales increases noted above are primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it improved or maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion was nominal 
additionally  given that no single customer accounts for more than of the company s annual revenue  the increase in sales has not been driven by any one particular customer or group of customers  but rather by the semiconductor and other high technology sectors as a whole 
gross profit gross profit for increased by million  to million  an increase of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the year over year sales increase  along with a slight improvement in sales mix  accounted for the company s higher gross profit in these factors were offset by reduced levels of factory utilization  underlying the lower comparative gross margin rate in when compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for decreased million  or  to million from million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from a year earlier  reflecting the increase in net sales and decrease in sg a expenditure levels 
the decrease in sg a expenses was due to lower employee costs of million  mainly reflecting decreases in incentive compensation in  as well as decreases in professional fees of million and lower sales commission expense of million 
in addition  the decrease in sg a costs is partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million 

table of contents included in the twelve month period ended december  is a million gain associated with the pension curtailment of the company s japan defined benefit pension plan 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses related to the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago  with the increase in er d expenditure levels offset by the effect of increased net sales 
the increase in er d expense mainly reflects higher employee costs and increases in overall er d expense levels related to the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
in addition  the increase in er d costs reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million 
moving into  the company is committed to the er d spending and capital investment needed to sustain its initiative in mm wafer handling as that technology is adopted over the next several years 
in addition  the company also intends to invest in its core membrane and coatings technologies to continue to create differentiated and high value  unit driven products for the most advanced and demanding semiconductor applications 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million for the decline reflects the absence of amortization expense for certain acquired developed technology and trade name assets that became fully amortized in either or interest expense interest expense was million in compared to net interest expense of million in the variance was mainly due to absence of outstanding debt in interest expense in included a charge of million for the accelerated write off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the replacement of the company s existing revolving credit facility with a new agreement 
interest expense for also included a charge for the accelerated write off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs in the amount of million interest income interest income was million in compared to interest income of million in the increase is due to a considerably higher average invested cash balance in other income expense  net other income was million in compared to other expense of million in in  other income primarily relates to a million gain recorded in connection with the sale of an equity investment 
in  other expense reflects foreign currency transaction losses of million  primarily related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities held by the company s us entity  offset in part by gains of million on the sale of the company s interest in two equity investments 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax expense of million in the company s year to date effective tax rate was in  compared to in in  the company s effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of due mainly to the million benefit to tax expense from the reduction of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded it is more likely than not that the company will realize the us net deferred tax assets and thereby released the valuation allowance on most of its us deferred tax assets 
the million of benefit to tax expense comprises million from the us utilization of deferred tax assets during the year  million from the utilization of foreign deferred tax assets  and million is attributed to the release of the valuation allowance at december  
table of contents in  the company s effective tax rate was lower than us statutory rates mainly due to the million decrease in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded the company will realize certain deferred tax assets related to current taxes payable and has thus released the allowance for a portion of its us deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate also benefitted from the company s tax holiday in malaysia whereby  as a result of employment commitments  research and development expenditures and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia is exempt from income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also affected by lower tax rates in certain of the company s taxable jurisdictions 
equity in net income loss of affiliates the company recorded equity in the net income of affiliates of million in compared to equity in the net loss of affiliates of million in results in included an impairment loss of million as the company determined that one of its investments accounted under the equity method was partially impaired 
net income attributable to entegris  inc net income attributable to the company was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income attributable to the company of million  or per diluted share  in the improvement mainly reflects the company s higher net sales and related gross profit increase  slightly reduced operating expenses and lower income tax expense  each described in greater detail above 
non gaap measures information the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the company also utilizes certain non gaap financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with gaap in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the company s business and results of operations

the company also provides certain non gaap financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with gaap in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the company s business and results of operations 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other regulations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
the company provides non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income together with related measures thereof  and non gaap earnings per share eps 
adjusted ebitda  a non gaap term  is defined by the company as net income attributable to entegris  inc before net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  equity in net income loss of affiliates  income tax expense benefit  other expense income  net  interest expense  net  amortization of intangible assets  gain associated with pension curtailment  and depreciation 
adjusted operating income  another non gaap term  is defined by the company as its adjusted ebitda less depreciation 
the company also utilizes non gaap measures whereby adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income are each divided by the company s net sales to derive adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted operating margin  respectively 
non gaap eps  a non gaap term  is defined by the company as net income attributable to entegris  inc before amortization of intangible assets  accelerated write off of debt issuance costs  gain on sale of equity investments  gain associated with pension curtailment  impairment of equity investments  the tax effect of the aforementioned adjustments to net income attributable to entegris  inc and reversal of deferred tax valuation allowance divided by weighted common shares outstanding 
the company provides supplemental non gaap financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the company s ongoing results 
management also uses these non gaap measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions 
management believes the company s non gaap measures help indicate the company s baseline performance before certain gains  losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the company s business or future outlook and offer a useful view of business performance in that the measures provide a more consistent means of comparing performance 
the company believes the non gaap measures aid investors overall understanding of the company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans  measures and evaluates the company s business performance 
management believes that the inclusion of non gaap measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the company s historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods 
management uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income to assist it in evaluations of the company s operating performance by excluding items that management does not consider as relevant in the results of its ongoing operations 
internally  these non gaap measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes  including the preparation of internal budgets  for allocating resources to enhance financial performance  for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies  and for evaluating the company s capacity to fund capital expenditures  secure financing and expand its business 
in addition  and as a consequence of the importance of these non gaap financial measures in managing its business  the company s board of directors uses non gaap financial measures in the evaluation process to determine management compensation 

table of contents the company believes that certain analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income and non gaap eps as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of firms in the company s industry 
additionally  lenders or potential lenders use adjusted ebitda measures to evaluate the company s creditworthiness 
the presentation of non gaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation  as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures or information provided in accordance with gaap 
management strongly encourages investors to review the company s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
management notes that the use of non gaap measures has limitations first  non gaap financial measures are not standardized 
accordingly  the methodology used to produce the company s non gaap financial measures is not computed under gaap and may differ notably from the methodology used by other companies 
for example  the company s non gaap measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda or an adjusted ebitda measure reported by other companies 
second  the company s non gaap financial measures exclude items such as amortization of intangibles and depreciation that are recurring 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation have been  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  a significant recurring expense with an impact upon the company s results of operations  notwithstanding the lack of immediate impact upon cash flows 
third  there is no assurance the company will not have restructuring activities  gains or losses on the sale of equity investments  accelerated write offs of debt issuance costs  or similar items in the future and  therefore  may need to record additional charges or credits associated with such items  including the tax effects thereon 
the exclusion of these items from the company s non gaap measures should not be construed as an implication that these costs are unusual  infrequent or non recurring 
management considers these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from these non gaap financial measures and evaluating these non gaap financial measures together with their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
the calculations of adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  and non gaap eps  and reconciliations between these financial measures and their most directly comparable gaap equivalents are presented below in the accompanying tables

material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the average of its materials  including polymers  stainless steel and purchased components  was moderately higher in compared to entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase in labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits rose slightly in and slightly higher total labor costs can be reasonably anticipated for the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with its large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
