certain of these financial measures are considered non gaap financial measures within the meaning of item of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
we believe that non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with the gaap results  provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by our management to evaluate financial results and to plan and forecast future periods 
however  non gaap financial measures should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures used by us may differ from the non gaap measures used by other companies  including our competitors 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss excluding the effects of interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and other non recurring income or expense items  such as in process research and development expense and acquisition related transaction expenses  restructuring expenses and litigation settlement expenses 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to adjusted ebitda is net income loss 
adjusted ebitda has limitations  therefore  it should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
furthermore  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income loss or net income loss as a measure of operating performance or to net cash provided by operating  investing or financing activities  or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs

the pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the realization of potential cost savings  revenue synergies or any restructuring costs 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million and accounts receivable  net of million 
management believes that such amounts will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements through at least december  our amended credit facility with silicon valley bank  or svb  contains financial covenants consisting of a minimum adjusted quick ratio and minimum quarterly free cash flow 
in november  we executed an agreement for a third amendment to the amended credit facility  or  the third amended credit facility with svb 
the third amended credit facility included a waiver for non compliance with the minimum quarterly financial covenants for the quarterly period ended september  and it also restructured the credit facility terms including future financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the minimum adjusted quick ratio covenant but were not in compliance with the minimum quarterly ebitda covenant 
in february  we executed a fourth amendment to the amended credit facility which included a waiver from svb for such non compliance 
see credit facility and other debt below 
based on our current board approved operating plan  we believe that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants of the third amended credit facility in the foreseeable future 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
if we are not able to achieve our planned revenue growth or incur costs in excess of our forecasts  we may be required to substantially reduce discretionary spending  and we could be in default of the third amended credit facility 
in addition to the financial covenants  the third amended credit facility contains other covenants including subjective covenants that would allow the lender to declare the loan immediately due and payable 
upon the occurrence of a covenant violation or other event of default that is not waived  the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the third amended credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lender were to accelerate the repayment of borrowings under the third amended credit facility for any reason  we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay the amounts borrowed under the third amended credit facility and would be forced to obtain alternative financing 
if we are not able to achieve the minimum targeted revenue growth and related improvements in profitability to meet the quarterly covenants or we have other unanticipated expenditures  we may be required to attempt to seek a waiver of such covenants  renegotiate the amended credit facility  seek additional capital and or substantially reduce discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
there can be no assurances that such a waiver could be obtained  that the third amended credit facility could be successfully renegotiated or that we could modify our operations to maintain liquidity 
if we are unable to obtain any required waivers or amendments  the lender would have the right to exercise remedies specified in the third amended credit facility  including accelerating the repayment of debt obligations as discussed above 
we may be forced to seek additional financing  which may include additional debt and or equity financing or funding through other third party agreements 
there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or available at all 
furthermore  any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 
historically  our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products  proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt 
our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations  acquisitions of businesses and intellectual property rights  payments relating to purchases of property and equipment and repayments of borrowings 
we expect that our 
table of contents principal uses of cash in the future will be for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  and potential acquisitions 
we expect that  as our revenues grow  our sales and marketing and research and development expenses will continue to grow and  as a result  we will need to generate significant net revenues to achieve profitability 
we will need to invest in working capital and surgical instruments the costs of which are capitalized in order to support our revenue projections through should we not be able to achieve our revenue forecast and cash consumption starts to exceed forecasted consumption  management will need to adjust our investment in surgical instruments and manage our inventory to the decreased sales volumes 
if we do not make these adjustments in a timely manner  there could be an adverse impact on our financial resources 
a substantial portion of our available cash funds is in business accounts with reputable financial institutions 
however  our deposits  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
the capital markets have recently been highly volatile and there has been a lack of liquidity for certain financial instruments  especially those with exposure to mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
this lack of liquidity has made it difficult for the fair value of these types of instruments to be determined 
we did not hold any marketable securities as of december  as a result of recent volatility in the capital markets  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
operating activities we generated net cash of million in operating activities for the year ended december  during this period  net cash provided by operating activities primarily consisted of a net loss of million  which was offset by an increase in working capital and other assets of million and million of non cash costs including amortization  depreciation  deferred income taxes  stock based compensation  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  litigation settlement expense and interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and issue costs 
the increase in working capital and other assets of million consisted of decreases in inventory of million in support of the lower sales volume  decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  increases in accounts payable of million and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and decreases in deferred revenue of million

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we account for revenue under provisions which set forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
determination of criteria iii and iv are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees 
specifically  our revenue from sales of spinal and other surgical implants is 
table of contents recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title to such implant 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
deferred revenues deferred revenues consist of products sold to distributors with payment terms greater than our customary business terms due to lack of credit history or operating in a new market in which we have no prior experience 
we defer the recognition of revenue until payments become due or cash is received from these distributors 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and the overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost primarily determined under the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a periodic basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory  and record a reserve for the identified items 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our biologics product inventories are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty as we are a high growth company  and we are continually reviewing our existing products and introducing new products 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding increase to cost of revenues and establish a new cost basis for the part 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets annually in december or each quarter if business conditions change and an earlier impairment indicator arises 
this assessment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible 
table of contents assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the our fair value to our net book value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to our carrying amount 
our assessment resulted in a fair value that was greater than our carrying value at december  in accordance with the authoritative literature  the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under provisions which require that share based payment transactions with employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
the amount of expense recognized during the period is affected by subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  the expected term for our stock options  the number of options expected to ultimately vest  and the timing of vesting for our share based awards 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following estimated volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award 
our estimated volatility through december  was based on a weighted average volatility of our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering in june and the historical stock volatilities of similar peer entities whose stock prices were publicly available 
our calculation of estimated volatility is based in part on historical stock prices of these peer entities over a period equal to the expected life of the awards 
we continue to use the historical volatility of peer entities due to the lack of sufficient historical data of our stock price since our initial public offering 
our estimated volatility may increase or decrease depending on the changes in our peer entities historical stock prices  changes in the composition of the peer entity group and changes to the expected term of our stock option awards 
an increase in the estimated volatility would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
our estimated expected term through december  was calculated using a weighted average term based on historical exercise patterns and the term from option date to full exercise for the options granted within the specified date range 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of a zero coupon us treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase to our stock based compensation expense 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we use historical data to estimate the number of future stock option forfeitures 
share based compensation recorded in our consolidated statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
our estimated forfeiture rates may differ from our actual forfeitures which would affect the amount of expense recognized during the period 
we account for stock option grants to non employees under provisions which require that the fair value of these instruments be recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are rendered 

table of contents share based compensation expense of awards with performance conditions is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the time the applicable condition is met 
determining the likelihood and timing of achieving performance conditions is a subjective judgment made by management which may affect the amount and timing of expense related to these share based awards 
share based compensation is adjusted to reflect the value of options which ultimately vest as such amounts become known in future periods 
as a result of these subjective and forward looking estimates  the actual value of our share based awards could differ significantly from those amounts recorded in our financial statements 
stock based compensation has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in thousands  except per share data year ended december  cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total effect on basic and diluted net loss per share income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with provisions which set forth an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized 
in making such a determination  a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of the income tax provision 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended its goodwill guidance by providing entities an option to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
an entity will be able to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
the amendment will be effective for the company on january  the company does not anticipate that this amendment will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires total comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income to be presented either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance will be effective for the company in the fiscal year beginning january  the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of other comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in other comprehensive income 
other than presentation  the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our borrowings under our line of credit expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding floating rate indebtedness totaled million 
the primary base interest rate is the silicon valley bank prime rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on our floating rate indebtedness remains constant over a year  a basis point increase in the interest rate would decrease pre tax income and cash flow by approximately million 
other outstanding debt consists of fixed rate instruments  including notes payable and capital leases 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency exposure continues to grow as we expand internationally 
our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro and japanese yen  in which our revenues and profits are denominated 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
commodity price risk we purchase raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as titanium and stainless steel 
these purchases expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact our product costs 
however  because our raw material prices comprise a small portion of our cost of revenues  we have not experienced any material impact on our results of operations from changes in commodity prices 
a change in commodity prices would not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december
