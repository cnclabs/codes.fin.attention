metal processing metal service center businesses plates and shapes and flat rolled and non ferrous groups industry overview 
companies operating in the metals industry can generally be characterized as primary metal producers  metal processors metal service centers or end users 
our plates and shapes and flat rolled and non ferrous groups are metals processors metal service centers 
as such  we purchase carbon steel  stainless steel  aluminum  brass  copper and other metals from producing mills and then sell our metal processing services and the metal to our customers  who are generally end users 
we believe that both primary metal producers and end users increasingly seek to have their metal processing and inventory management requirements met by value added oriented metal processors metal service centers like us 
metal service centers function as key intermediaries between the primary metals producers that produce and sell larger volumes of metals in a limited number of sizes and configurations and end users  such as fabricators  contractors and oems that require smaller quantities of more customized products delivered on a just in time basis 
end users incorporate processed metals into finished products  in some cases with little further modification 
in our plates and shapes and flat rolled and non ferrous groups  we engage in pre production processing of carbon steel  stainless steel  red metals and aluminum 
we purchase metals from primary producers  maintain an inventory of various metals to allow rapid fulfillment of customer orders and perform customized processing services to the specifications provided by end users 
by providing these services  as well as offering inventory management and just in time delivery services  we enable our customers to reduce overall production costs and decrease capital required for raw materials inventory and metals processing equipment 
the plates and shapes and flat rolled and non ferrous groups contributed approximately of our net sales 
metal service centers and processors purchase approximately of all the metals used in the us and canada and play an important intermediary role between the production mills and the end users 
over the last several years primary metal producers have consolidated and focused on optimizing the throughput and operating efficiencies of their production facilities 
we believe this consolidation among primary steel and aluminum producers over the last several years has expanded the demand for metal distribution and service centers  and in particular those service centers capable of providing additional value added metal processing and inventory management services 
over  end users nationwide rely on metal service centers for their primary supply of metal products and services 
end users generally buy metal products and services from metal service centers on a margin over the cost of the metal 
when customers require additional processing or inventory management services  value added metal service centers such as ours earn an additional premium margin over the cost of metal 
by outsourcing their customized metal processing and inventory management needs  end users have the potential to realize significant economic benefits by shifting the responsibility for pre production processing to metal service centers and leveraging service centers just in time delivery and other inventory management services 
these supply chain services  which are not normally provided by primary metals producers  enable end users to reduce input  labor and other production costs  shorten lead times  and decrease required investments in working capital  manufacturing and warehouse facilities 
we believe that long term growth opportunities for metal service centers will continue to expand as both primary metal producers and end users increasingly seek to have their metal processing and inventory management requirements met by value added metal service centers 
although the service center industry remains fragmented with approximately  companies competing in north america  we believe larger service 
table of contents center businesses with greater scale and financial flexibility  like ours  enjoy significant advantages over smaller companies such as the ability to obtain higher discounts associated with volume purchases  the breadth of products and value added services to meet the diverse needs of key end use markets  and the more sophisticated logistics capabilities necessary to serve national accounts 
plates and shapes group 
the plates and shapes group processes and sells steel plates and structural beams  bars  angles and tubes 
we believe we are one of the largest distributors of steel plates and structural beams in the united states 
in  we sold approximately thousand tons of products through metal service centers located primarily in the southern and eastern regions of the united states 
our metal service centers are generally equipped to provide additional value added processing  and a substantial portion of our volume is processed prior to being delivered to the end user 
these processing services include burning  blasting and painting the process of cleaning steel plate by shot blasting  then immediately applying a paint or primer  tee splitting the cutting of metal beams along the length to form separate pieces  cambering the bending of structural shapes to improve load bearing capabilities  leveling the flattening of metals to uniform tolerances for proper machining  cutting  sawing  punching  drilling  beveling  surface grinding  braking bending  shearing and cutting to length the cutting of metals into pieces and along the width of a coil to create sheets or plates 
we sell our products to a diversified customer base  including a large number of small customers who purchase products in small order sizes 
we believe our disciplined management and hands on service  backed by our national network of metal service centers  enables us to effectively meet our customers varied product and inventory management needs 
we generally earn additional margin from our customers by providing services such as product marking  item sequencing  just in time delivery and kitting 
the customers who require these products and services are primarily in the fabrication  public and private non residential construction  machinery and equipment  land and marine transportation  and energy industries 
because our metal service centers are generally located in close proximity to our metal suppliers and our customers  we are able to meet our customers product and service needs reliably and consistently 
over the last six years  we added two businesses to our plates and shapes portfolio through acquisitions 
in may  we completed the acquisition of port city  which bolstered our presence in the construction and oil field services sectors 
in february  we acquired philadelphia plate  which has expanded our presence in the northeast region of the united states and augmented our presence in the marine and defense sectors 
flat rolled and non ferrous group 
the flat rolled and non ferrous group processes and sells flat rolled carbon and stainless steel  aluminum  brass and copper in a number of alloy grades and sizes through metal service centers located primarily in the mid western and southern regions of the united states 
we sold approximately thousand tons of these products in  with our revenues split approximately and between ferrous products and non ferrous products  respectively 
substantially all of the products from this group that are sold undergo value added processing prior to shipment to our customers 
these processing services include precision blanking the process in which metal is cut into precise two dimensional shapes  slitting the cutting of coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil  shearing and cutting to length  punching and leveling 
we sell our products and services to customers in the electrical and appliance manufacturing  fabrication  furniture  machinery and equipment  transportation and aerospace industries 
many of our large customers purchase through pricing arrangements or contractual agreements that specify the margin over the cost of metal and we generally earn additional margin from these customers by providing services such as product marking and labeling  just in time delivery and kitting 
we are able to provide these services reliably because our metal service centers are generally located in close proximity to our metal suppliers and our customers 
over the last six years  we added four businesses to our flat rolled and non ferrous portfolio through acquisitions 
in july  we acquired lynch metals  a metal service center business that provides specialized aluminum products primarily to the aerospace  industrial and automotive industries 
in june  we acquired j 
rubin  expanding the scope of our product lines  services and geographic footprint in the upper midwest  in addition to allowing us 
table of contents to enhance our cross selling opportunities in existing markets 
in december  we acquired orms  a metal service center with distinctive processing and service capabilities and a strategic location in an existing midwest market 
in march  we acquired trident  a wholesale distributor of metals  plastics and electronic parts with fabricating capabilities designed to service the oil and gas industry 
product mix 
we provide a wide variety of metal products in different shapes and sizes to our customers 
we actively manage our inventory levels and product mix in order to optimize the cost tradeoff between holding inventory and incurring a shortage situation 
we strive to closely monitor our customer demand forecasts and coordinate our inventory levels and product mix with our customers production planning and scheduling 
we also analyze macroeconomic data  end use market data and historical usage to forecast the cyclical effect of inventory building and reduction in the industries we serve  adjusting our inventory levels and product mix accordingly 
our product mix also changes as a result of acquisitions 
we believe the proactive management of our inventory levels and product mix  along with our expanding geographic footprint and diverse customer segments position us to maintain long term profitability throughout the various stages of economic cycles 
we believe that our focus on product mix enhancement helps us to mitigate the effects of uneven demand associated with specific regions and end user industries 
net sales by product line as a percent of total sales for our metal service center businesses for each of the three years ended december    and were as follows twelve months ended december  carbon flat rolled products mini mill products non ferrous products plate products structural products value added processing services 
primary producers typically find it more cost effective to focus on large volume production and sale of metals in standard sizes and configurations to large volume purchasers 
we process the metals to the precise length  width  shape and surface quality specified by our customers 
our value added processes include precision blanking the process in which metal is cut into precise two dimensional shapes 
flame cutting the cutting of metals to produce various shapes according to customer supplied drawings 
laser and plasma cutting the cutting of metals to produce shapes under strict tolerance requirements 
slitting the cutting of coiled metals to specified widths along the length of the coil 
blasting and painting the process of cleaning steel plate by shot blasting  then immediately applying a paint or primer 
plate forming and rolling the forming and bending of plates to cylindrical or required specifications 
shearing and cutting to length the cutting of metals into pieces and along the width of a coil to create sheets or plates 
tee splitting the cutting of metal beams along the length to form separate pieces 
cambering the bending of structural shapes to improve load bearing capabilities 
sawing the cutting to length of bars  tubular goods and beams 

table of contents leveling the flattening of metals to uniform tolerances for proper machining 
edge trimming a process that removes a specified portion of the outside edges of coiled metal to produce uniform width and round or smooth edges 
metallurgy the analysis and testing of the physical and chemical composition of metals 
our additional capabilities include applications engineering and other value added processes such as custom machining 
using these capabilities  we use processed metals to manufacture higher value components 
once we receive an order  we select the appropriate inventory and schedule it for processing in accordance with the customer s requirements and specified delivery date 
orders are monitored by our computer systems  including  in certain locations  the use of bar coding to aid in and reduce the cost of tracking material 
we record the source of all metal shipped to customers 
this enables us to identify the source of any metal which may later be shown to not meet industry standards or that fails during or after manufacture 
this capability is important to our customers as it allows them to assign responsibility for non conforming or defective metal to the mill that produced the metal 
many of the products and services we provide can be ordered and tracked through a web based electronic network that directly connects our computer system to those of our customers 
we cooperate with our customers and tailor our deliveries to support their needs  which in many instances consist of short lead times  multiple daily deliveries  staged deliveries  or deliveries timed for immediate production 
these just in time deliveries are defined by our customers and are generally intended to minimize their inventory investment and handling requirements 
while we ship products throughout the united states  most of our customers are located within a mile radius of our facilities  thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a large number of short lead time orders 
we transport most of our products directly to our customers either with our own trucks for short distance and or multi stop deliveries or through common or contract trucking companies 
we have quality control systems to ensure product quality and traceability throughout processing 
quality controls include periodic supplier audits  customer approved quality standards  inspection criteria and metals source traceability 
twenty of our metal service center facilities have international standards for organization  or iso  certification 
building products group the building products group manufactures and sells roofing and patio products 
we generally sell these products through a network of independent distributors and home improvement contractors 
our roofing products business manufactures and sells a high performance roofing product consisting of a pressed and stone coated steel panel that mimics the appearance of traditional shake and tile roofing 
our roofing product is well suited for all areas subject to threats of high winds  fires and hail storms 
in may  we acquired duraloc roofing systems  ltd  a canadian based company which we have re branded as allmet roofing products 
this acquisition provided us with manufacturing capabilities on both the east and west coasts of north america 
our patio products business manufactures and sells building components used primarily for the erection of residential shade structures such as patio covers and enclosures 
with facilities located throughout the southern and western regions of the united states  we believe we are one of only a few suppliers of patio products with national scale 
the downturn in the united states housing sector has pushed home improvement remodeling spending below its long term trend 
falling home prices have discouraged discretionary home improvement spending and diminished the amount of equity that owners have in their homes 
prior to the downturn in the united states housing sector  the ability to borrow against equity created by rising home prices fueled remodeling activity  as well as broader consumer spending 
now that home prices have softened  owners cannot finance home improvement projects as easily 
these difficult end market conditions have affected sales growth associated with our building products group 

table of contents we believe a recovering economy should stabilize house prices and consumer confidence levels  encouraging homeowners to reinvest in their homes and undertake deferred repairs  replacements and improvements 
low financing costs and a wave of previously foreclosed homes coming back on the market and in need of renovation could also contribute to growth 
we believe these factors  coupled with an aging american housing stock  are generating significant pent up demand for remodeling that should manifest itself when the housing sector rebounds however  there can be no guarantee that demand for remodeling will increase or the timing of any such rebound 
strategy our mission is to increase our position as one of the nation s leading integrated metals processors and distributors  recognized for best in class customer service and optimal inventory management to meet customer demands  and to ensure strategic use of our capital resources  continuing to strengthen the relationships we have with our suppliers  while constantly renewing our focus on safety  growth and profitability 
execution of the following strategies is critical to our success expand value added services 
we intend to continue to invest in capital projects that provide attractive returns and to continue to expand the value added services we offer at each of our service center locations  a strategy we believe will both enhance our relationships with existing customers and help forge new customer relationships  both of which we believe will result in increased market share for us 
increase sales of higher margin products and services 
the sale of higher margin products and services  which tend to have higher growth prospects and more stable demand  will continue to be one of our core strategies 
we intend to continue executing on this strategy by increasing our core carbon offerings  non ferrous volumes  and our sales of processed products 
execute strategic acquisitions to improve our business 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and we will generally target one to two bolt on acquisitions per year that will enhance our metal service center strategy 
we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the fragmented service center industry because of our flexible capital structure 
maintain and strengthen our strong relationships with suppliers and customers 
as one of the largest metal service center businesses in the united states  we intend to use our relationships to leverage the opportunities presented by the consolidation of steel producers and the changing needs of our customers 
continue our strong focus on inventory management 
we will continue managing our inventory to maximize our returns  profitability and cash flow while maintaining sufficient inventory to respond to our customers demands 
constant evaluation of our inventory management framework will allow us to continue supplying our customers reliably  even during periods of tight metal supply 
we expect our inventory management framework will continue generating strong earnings during periods of rising metal prices and strong cash flow during periods of declining metal prices 
maintain high free cash flow generation and conversion 
we believe that we are a reliable supplier  especially of higher margin products and services  to our customers even in periods of tight supply 
we believe that our reliability allows us to generate higher margins and more stable operating income through the business cycle 
moreover  we believe our inventory management framework  bolstered by our relationships with our metals suppliers  will stabilize earnings during periods of weakness 
our core business also requires minimal maintenance capital investment 
we believe these strengths taken together underscore our ability to generate high levels of free cash flow  which will enable us to reinvest in our business  consummate future acquisitions  reduce debt  and achieve other corporate and financial objectives 
maintain our focus on safety throughout our operating facilities 
we remain committed to the belief that nothing is more important than the safety of our people and will continue our disciplined focus on constantly improving the safety performance of our operations 

table of contents raw materials and supply in recent years  steel  aluminum  copper and other metals production in the united states has fluctuated from period to period as mills attempt to match production to projected demand 
periodically  this has resulted in shortages of  or increased ordering lead times for  some products  as well as fluctuations in price 
typically  metals producers announce price changes with sufficient advance notice to allow us to order additional products prior to the effective date of a price increase  or to defer purchases until a price decrease becomes effective 
our purchasing decisions are based on our forecast of the availability of metal products  ordering lead times and pricing  as well as our prediction of customer demand for specific products 
we obtain the overwhelming majority of our metals from domestic suppliers  which include nucor corp  ak steel  arcelor mittal  north american stainless  thyssen krupp steel usa  and steel dynamics 
although we have historically purchased approximately to of our raw material supplies from foreign producers  domestic suppliers have always been  and we believe will continue to be  our principal source of raw material 
although most forms of steel and aluminum produced by mills can be obtained from a number of integrated mills or mini mills  both domestically and internationally  there are a few products that are available from only a limited number of producers 
since most metals are shipped free on board and the transportation of metals is a significant cost factor  we generally seek to purchase metals  to the extent possible  from the nearest mill 
during the last decade  us steel  nucor corp 
and arcelor mittal acquired several of their domestic competitors  and international integrated producers merged and consolidated operations 
the result of this trend has been fewer integrated producers from which we can purchase our raw materials 
we believe that global consolidation of the metals industry is beneficial to the metals industry as a whole by enhancing efficiency 
however  such consolidation could result in price increases for the metal that we purchase 
sales and marketing  customers we employ a sales force consisting of internal and external salespeople 
internal salespeople are primarily responsible for maintaining customer relationships  receiving and soliciting individual orders and responding to service and other inquiries by customers 
our external sales force is primarily responsible for identifying potential customers and calling on them to explain our services 
we believe that our sales force is trained and knowledgeable about the characteristics and applications of various metals  as well as the manufacturing methods employed by our customers 
our sales and marketing focus is on the identification of end users that could achieve significant cost savings through the use of our inventory management  value added processing  just in time delivery and other services 
we use a variety of methods to identify potential customers  including the use of databases  direct mail and participation in manufacturers trade shows 
customer referrals and the knowledge of our sales force about regional end users also result in the identification of potential customers 
once a potential customer is identified  our outside salespeople assume responsibility for visiting the appropriate contact  typically the purchasing manager or manager of operations 
nearly all sales are on a negotiated price basis 
in some cases  sales are the result of a competitive bid process where a customer provides a list of products  along with requirements  to us and several competitors and we submit a bid on each product 
we have a diverse customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of our net sales in each of the last three years 
our ten largest customers represented less than of our net sales in for the year ended december   the average transaction size for our metal service centers was approximately  we have sought to enhance our position in stable growth industries that demand additional value added services and reduce our exposure to more cyclical sectors 
through our organic growth and acquisitions  we have capitalized on opportunities to augment our existing product and service portfolio with high value added products such as aluminum brazing sheet  armor plate  marine grade aluminum plate  and pressure vessel plate to service the aerospace  marine  defense  and oil and gas industries 
our broad 
table of contents portfolio of high quality metal products and customized value added services allows us to offer one stop shopping to our customers 
we believe the breadth of our portfolio provides a significant competitive advantage over smaller metal service centers  which generally stock fewer products and offer fewer services than we do 
logo competition the metals distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
service centers compete with each other on price  service  quality and availability of products 
according to metal center news  metals usa is ranked number twelve among service centers in north america based on revenues 
markets are generally oriented on a regional and local basis 
we have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations 
in every market we service we compete with various combinations of other large  value added oriented metals processor metal service centers some of which may have greater financial resources than we have  smaller metals processors metal service centers and  to a much lesser extent  with primary metals producers  who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals 
our sales and services decisions are decentralized  providing local management the flexibility to quickly address local market conditions 
historically  we believe we have been able to compete effectively because of our high levels of service  broad based inventory  knowledgeable and trained sales force  integrated computer systems  modern equipment  numerous locations  geographic dispersion  operational economies of scale and combined purchasing volume 
furthermore  we believe our liquidity and overall financial position affords us a good platform with which to compete with our peers in the industry 
government regulation and environmental matters our operations are subject to a number of federal  state and local regulations relating to the protection of the environment and to workplace health and safety 
in particular  our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing waste disposal  air and water emissions  the handling of hazardous substances  environmental protection  remediation  workplace exposure and other matters 
hazardous materials 
table of contents we use in our operations include general commercial lubricants and cleaning solvents 
among the more significant regulated activities that occur at some of our facilities are the accumulation of scrap metal  which is sold for recycling  the generation of plant trash and other solid wastes and wastewaters  such as water from burning tables operated at some of our facilities  which wastes are disposed of in accordance with the federal water pollution control act and the resource conservation and recovery act using third party commercial waste handlers  and the storage  handling  and use of lubricating and cutting oils and small quantities of maintenance related products and chemicals  the health hazards of which are communicated to employees pursuant to occupational safety and health act prescribed hazard communication efforts and the disposal or recycling of which are performed pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act 
generally speaking  our facilities operations do not involve the types of emissions of air pollutants  discharges of pollutants to land or surface water  or treatment  storage  or disposal of hazardous waste which would ordinarily require federal or state environmental permits 
some of our facilities possess authorizations for air emissions from paints and coatings  hazardous materials permits under local fire codes or ordinances for the storage and use of small quantities of combustible materials such as oils or paints  and state or local permits for on site septic systems 
our cost of obtaining and complying with such permits has not been and is not anticipated to be material 
our operations are such that environmental regulations typically have not required us to make significant capital expenditures for environmental compliance activities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental and workplace health and safety laws and do not currently anticipate that we will be required to expend any substantial amounts in the foreseeable future in order to meet such requirements 
however  some of the properties we own or lease are located in areas with a history of heavy industrial use  and are near sites listed on the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla national priority list 
cercla establishes joint and several responsibility for clean up without regard to fault for persons who have arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at sites that have become contaminated and for persons who own or operate contaminated facilities 
we have a number of properties located in or near industrial or light industrial use areas  accordingly  these properties may have been contaminated by pollutants which would have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been deposited by prior occupants 
some of our properties are affected by contamination from leaks and drips of cutting oils and similar materials 
the costs of clean ups to date have not been material 
we are not currently subject to any claims or notices with respect to clean up or remediation under cercla or similar laws for contamination at our leased or owned properties or at any off site location 
however  we cannot rule out the possibility that we could be notified of such claims in the future 
it is also possible that we could be identified by the environmental protection agency  a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under cercla or under analogous state laws 
management information systems both the plates and shapes group and flat rolled and non ferrous group metal service centers use a system marketed and distributed specifically for the metal service center industry 
during  we completed a similar common platform initiative in the building products group 
some of our subsidiaries currently use electronic data interchange  through which they offer customers a paperless process with respect to order entry  shipment tracking  billing  remittance processing and other routine activities 
additionally  several of our subsidiaries also use computer aided drafting systems to directly interface with computer controlled metals processing  resulting in more efficient use of material and time 
we believe investment in uniform management information systems and computer aided manufacturing technology permits us to respond quickly and proactively to our customers needs and service expectations 
these systems are able to share data regarding inventory status  order backlog  and other critical operational information on a real time basis 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons 
as of december   approximately  or approximately of our employees  at various sites were members of unions the united steelworkers of america  the sheet metals workers union  the international association of bridge  structural  and ornamental ironworkers of america  and the international brotherhood of teamsters 
our relationship with these unions generally has been satisfactory 
within the last five years  we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities 
we are currently a party to seven collective bargaining agreements 
six expire in and one expires in presently  we do not anticipate any problems or issues with respect to renewing these agreements upon acceptable terms

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following are some of the potential risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below  as well as other information contained in this document  when evaluating your investments in our securities 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are heavily affected by changing metal prices 
we believe metal prices are currently increasing from a low point in the cycle toward a new high point in the cycle which may not continue 
metal costs typically represent approximately of our net sales 
metal costs can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  production levels  competition  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us and may  therefore  adversely affect our net sales  operating margin and net income 
our metal service centers maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  using information derived from customers  market conditions  historic usage and industry research  we purchase metal in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers 
our commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders 
we have no substantial long term  fixed price purchase contracts 
when raw material prices rise  we may not be able to pass the price increase on to our customers 
when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and  to the extent we reduce existing inventory quantities  lower margins 
there have been historical periods of rapid and significant movements in the prices of metal both upward and downward 
these changes can make it difficult for us to accurately forecast our results  which could cause us to have higher or lower levels of inventory than required or make expenditures that may not generate expected returns 
any limitation on our ability to pass through any price increases to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in metal prices which we believe are currently increasing  which may not continue also affect our liquidity because of the time difference between our payment for our raw materials and our collection of cash from our customers 
we sell our products and typically collect our accounts receivable within days after the sale  however  we tend to pay for replacement materials which are more expensive when metal prices are rising over a much shorter period  in part to benefit from early payment discounts 
as a result  when metal prices are rising  we tend to draw more on our million amended and restated senior secured asset based credit facility due the abl facility to cover the cash flow cycle from our raw material purchases to cash collection 
this cash requirement for working capital is higher in periods when we are increasing inventory quantities 
our liquidity is thus adversely affected by rising metal prices 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources operating and investing activities 
our operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected during economic downturns because the demand for our products is cyclical 
we believe demand for our product is currently in the lower end of the cycle  although conditions have steadily improved throughout the latter half of through year end which may not continue 
many of our products are used in businesses that are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns due to economic conditions  energy prices  consumer demand and other factors beyond our control 
these economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess capacity and  in some cases  lower average selling prices for our products 
the recent economic 
table of contents downturn and uncertainty about current global economic conditions pose risks as businesses in one or more of the markets that we serve  or consumers in one or more of the end use markets that our customers serve  may postpone purchases in response to tighter credit  negative financial news and or declines in asset values  which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  as an increasing amount of our customers relocate their manufacturing facilities outside of the united states  we may not be able to maintain our level of sales to those customers 
the decline in steel prices resulting from weakened demand and an oversupply of steel throughout the supply chain during the latter half of and first half of contributed to a significant decline in steel product shipments from metals service centers in the united states 
reduced demand in a number of our markets combined with the foreign relocation of some of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our customers sell their products abroad  and some of our suppliers buy feedstock abroad 
as a result  our business is affected by general economic conditions and other factors outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia 
our suppliers access to metal  and therefore our access to metal  is additionally affected by such conditions and factors 
similarly  the demand for our customers products  and therefore our products  is affected by such conditions and factors 
these conditions and factors include enhanced imbalances in the world s iron ore  coal and steel industries  a downturn in world economies  increases in interest rates  unfavorable currency fluctuations or a slowdown in the key industries served by our customers 
in addition  demand for the products of our building products group has been adversely affected by the downturn in the us housing market  since the results of that group depend on a strong residential remodeling industry  which in turn has been historically driven by an expansion in the broader housing market and relatively high consumer confidence 
we rely on metal suppliers in our business and purchase a significant amount of metal from a limited number of suppliers and termination of one or more of our relationships with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we use a variety of metals in our business 
our operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of metal on a timely basis 
we purchase most of our metal from a limited number of metal suppliers 
as of december   our top three metals suppliers represent a significant portion of our total metal purchasing cost 
termination of our relationship with any of these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows if we were unable to obtain metal from other sources in a timely manner 
in addition  the domestic metals production industry has experienced consolidation in recent years 
further consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of our major suppliers or a decrease in the number of alternative supply sources available to us  which could make it more likely that termination of one or more of our relationships with major suppliers would result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
consolidation could also result in price increases for the metal that we purchase 
such price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows if we were not able to pass these price increases on to our customers 
intense competition in our fragmented industry could adversely affect our profitability 
we are engaged in a highly fragmented and competitive industry 
we compete with a large number of other value added oriented metals processor metal service centers on a regional and local basis  some of which may have greater financial resources than we have 
service centers compete with each other on price  service  quality and availability of products 
according to metal center news  metals usa is ranked number twelve among service centers in north america based on revenues 
we also compete  to a much lesser extent  with 
table of contents primary metals producers  who typically sell to very large customers requiring regular shipments of large volumes of metals 
because price  particularly in the ferrous flat rolled business  is a competitive factor  we may be required in the future to reduce sales volumes to maintain our level of profitability 
increased competition in any of our businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to retain our key employees is critical to the success of our business  and failure to do so may adversely affect our revenues and as a result could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are dependent on the services of our chief executive officer and other members of our senior management team to remain competitive in our industry 
we may not be able to retain or replace one or more of these key employees  we may suffer an extended interruption in one or more of their services or we may lose the services of one or more of these key employees entirely 
our current key employees are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that permit the employees to terminate their employment without notice 
other than a life insurance policy maintained by us on our chief executive officer  for which we are the beneficiary  we do not maintain any life insurance policies for our key employees 
if any of our key employees were not able to dedicate adequate time to our business  due to personal or other factors  if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of any of our key employees or if any of our key employees were to terminate their employment it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management or other key employees  should the need arise 
from time to time  there are shortages of qualified operators of metals processing equipment 
in addition  during periods of low unemployment  turnover among less skilled workers can be relatively high 
any failure to retain a sufficient number of such employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are subject to litigation that could strain our resources and distract management 
from time to time  we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business 
these suits concern issues including product liability  contract disputes  employee related matters and personal injury matters 
it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending suits and claims  and the ultimate resolution of these matters as well as future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or reputation 
environmental costs could decrease our net cash flow and adversely affect our profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive regulations governing waste disposal  air and water emissions  the handling of hazardous substances  remediation  workplace exposure and other environmental matters 
some of the properties we own or lease are located in areas with a history of heavy industrial use  and are near sites listed for clean up under cercla 
see business government regulation and environmental matters 
cercla established joint and several responsibility for clean up without regard to fault for persons who have arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at sites that have become contaminated and for persons who own or operate contaminated facilities 
we have a number of properties located in or near industrial or light industrial use areas  accordingly  these properties may have been contaminated by pollutants which would have migrated from neighboring facilities or have been deposited by prior occupants 
some of our properties are affected by contamination from leaks and drips of cutting oils and similar materials 
the costs of clean ups to date have not been material 
it is possible that we could be notified of such claims in the future 
see business government regulation and environmental matters 
it is also possible that we could be identified by the environmental 
table of contents protection agency  a state agency or one or more third parties as a potentially responsible party under cercla or under analogous state laws 
if so  we could incur substantial costs related to such claims  which could decrease our net cash flows and adversely affect our profitability 
adverse developments in our relationship with our unionized employees could adversely affect our business 
as of december   approximately of our employees approximately at various sites were members of unions 
we are currently a party to seven collective bargaining agreements 
six expire in and one expires in presently we do not anticipate any problems or issues with respect to renewing these agreements upon acceptable terms 
however  no assurances can be given that we will succeed in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements to replace the expiring ones without a strike 
any strikes in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see business employees for a discussion of our previous negotiations of collective bargaining agreements 
we may not successfully implement our acquisition strategy  and acquisitions that we pursue may present unforeseen integration obstacles and costs  increase our leverage and negatively impact our performance 
we intend to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy  and we generally target one to two bolt on acquisitions per year that will enhance our metal service center strategy 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  they may be larger than our historical targets 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions of related businesses  or our failure to integrate such businesses successfully into our existing businesses  could affect our growth or result in our incurring unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and may complete one or more significant acquisitions in the future 
to finance an acquisition  we may incur debt or issue equity  both of which could be materially greater amounts than in connection with prior acquisitions 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with our acquisition strategy which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unexpected loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company  conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  coordinating new product and process development  hiring additional management and other critical personnel  encountering unknown contingent liabilities that could be material  and increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
as a result of the foregoing  our acquisition strategy may not be successfully received by customers  and we may not realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions 
metals usa holdings is a holding company and relies on dividends and other payments  advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet its dividend and other obligations 
metals usa holdings has no direct operations and derives all of its cash flow from its subsidiaries 
because metals usa holdings conducts its operations through its subsidiaries  metals usa holdings depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations  and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock 
legal and contractual restrictions in the abl facility  the indenture governing metals usa s senior secured notes due the metals usa notes and other 
table of contents agreements governing current and future indebtedness of metals usa holdings subsidiaries  as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of metals usa holdings subsidiaries  currently limit and may  in the future  limit metals usa holdings ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries 
the earnings from  or other available assets of  metals usa holdings subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable metals usa holdings to pay any dividends on our common stock 
we may not be able to retain or expand our customer base if the north american manufacturing industry continues to erode through moving offshore or through acquisition and merger or consolidation activity in our customers industries 
our customer base  including our flat rolled and non ferrous group s customer base  primarily includes manufacturing and industrial firms 
some of these customers operate in industries that are undergoing consolidation through acquisition and merger activity  some are considering or have considered relocating production operations overseas or outsourcing particular functions overseas  and some customers have closed as they were unable to compete successfully with overseas competitors 
our facilities are predominately located in the mid western and southern united states 
to the extent that these customers cease us operations  relocate or move operations overseas to regions in which we do not have a presence  we could lose their business 
in addition  acquirers of manufacturing and industrial firms may have suppliers of choice that do not include us  which could affect our customer base and sales 
we may face product liability claims that are costly and create adverse publicity 
if any of the products that we sell cause harm to any of our customers  we could be exposed to product liability lawsuits 
if we were found liable under product liability claims  we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages 
further  even if we successfully defended ourselves against this type of claim  we could be forced to spend a substantial amount of money in litigation expenses  our management could be required to spend valuable time to defend against these claims and our reputation could suffer  any of which could harm our business 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
the metals usa notes  the abl facility and our other outstanding indebtedness are expected to account for significant cash interest expenses in fiscal and subsequent years 
accordingly  we will have to generate significant cash flows from operations to meet our debt service requirements 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements  we may need to seek additional financing  however  this insufficient cash flow may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
furthermore  apollo has no obligation to provide us with debt or equity financing and we therefore may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness 
our use of leverage exposes us to interest rate risk and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness 
as of december   our total indebtedness was million 
we also had an additional million available for borrowing under the abl facility as of that date 
our indebtedness could have important consequences for you  including it may limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow money  dispose of assets or sell equity for our working capital  capital expenditures  dividend payments  debt service requirements  strategic initiatives or other purposes  
table of contents it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our operations or business  we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy  and there would be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows if we were unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  as needed 
our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the abl facility and the indenture governing the metals usa notes the metals usa notes indenture or the identure contain various covenants that limit or prohibit our ability  among other things  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase  retire or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments  enter into or permit certain agreements or make certain investments or loans  sell certain assets  create or incur liens  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 
the metals usa notes indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions  such as incurring additional debt  if we are unable to meet defined adjusted ebitda to fixed charges and consolidated total debt ratios each  as defined by the indenture 
the covenants in the indenture require us to have an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio measured on a trailing four quarter basis of to to incur ratio indebtedness and a consolidated total debt ratio of no greater than to to incur ratio indebtedness in connection with acquisitions 
based on the calculations for the trailing four quarters  we are able to satisfy these covenants and incur additional indebtedness under these ratios  including for acquisition purposes  under the indenture 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio fccr  as defined by the loan and security agreement governing the abl facility  was 
as of december  we had million of additional borrowing capacity under the abl facility 
failure to comply with the fccr covenant of the abl facility can result in limiting our long term growth prospects by hindering our ability to incur future indebtedness or grow through acquisitions 
we do not have to maintain a minimum fccr as long as our borrowing availability under the abl facility is greater than or equal to the greater of i million and ii of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitment the minimum availability 
we must maintain an fccr of at least to if borrowing availability falls below the minimum availability 
our inability to satisfy the terms of the negative covenants in our debt agreements do not  by themselves  constitute covenant violations or events of default 
rather  they are event related restrictions that limit or prohibit the company from taking certain corporate actions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources covenant compliance 
the restrictions contained in the agreements that govern the terms of our debt could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans  
table of contents adversely affect our ability to finance our operations  to enter into strategic acquisitions  investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest  and limit our access to the cash generated by our subsidiaries 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the abl facility  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the abl facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under the abl facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the abl facility on a first priority lien basis 
if the lenders under the abl facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings  such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  we may not have sufficient assets to repay the metals usa notes upon acceleration 
for a more detailed description on the limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
despite our current indebtedness  we may still be able to incur significantly more indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the terms of the metals usa notes indenture and the abl facility contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
accordingly  we or our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing under the abl facility  including the subfacility for letters of credit  and the covenants under our debt agreements would allow us to borrow a significant amount of additional indebtedness 
in addition  the metals usa notes indenture does not limit the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by flag intermediate or metals usa holdings 
additional leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and could increase the risks described in our use of leverage exposes us to interest rate risk and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness  our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short term interest rates  we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing short term interest rates  we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short term prevailing interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt under the abl facility and our industrial revenue bonds irbs 
we also had an additional million available for borrowing under the abl facility as of december  assuming a consistent level of debt  a basis point change in the interest rate on our floating rate debt effective from the beginning of the year would increase or decrease our fiscal interest expense under the abl facility and the irbs by approximately million 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the potential impact of our interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of irbs that were hedged under interest rate swap agreements 
to some extent  derivative financial instruments can protect against increases in interest rates  but they do not provide complete protection over the longer term 
if interest rates increase dramatically  we could be unable to service our debt which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
