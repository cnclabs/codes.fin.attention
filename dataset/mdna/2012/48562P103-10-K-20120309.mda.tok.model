table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
kapstone believes our critical accounting policies are those described below 
the company s audit committee has reviewed the policies listed below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
sales with terms designated fob free on board shipping point are recognized at the time of shipment 
for sales transactions with terms fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s site and when title and risk of loss are transferred 
sales on consignment are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the month that the goods are consumed or after a period of time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by contract terms 
incentive rebates are typically paid in cash and are netted against revenue on an accrual basis as qualifying purchases are made by the customer to earn and thereby retain the rebate 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of shaft horsepower  generated by its cogeneration facility  on a gross basis and within net sales 
freight charged to customers is recognized in net sales 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
on an annual basis and in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a market approach as well as an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of the company s operating segment 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if necessary  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
pension and postretirement benefits kapstone provides pension and postretirement benefits to certain employees and accounts for these benefits in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits 
for financial reporting purposes  long term assumptions are developed through consultations with actuaries 
such assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  health care trend rates and mortality rates 
the discount rate for the current year is based on long term high quality bond rates 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with asc  income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax 
table of contents rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when it is more likely than not to be sustained on its technical merits 
stock based compensation costs the company accounts for stock compensation expense in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
the compensation expense for stock options is recorded on an accelerated basis over the awards vesting periods 
the compensation expense for restricted stock is recorded on a straight line basis over the awards vesting periods 
forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant and revised if actual or expected forfeiture activity differs materially from the original estimate

the company is exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency 
interest rates under kapstone kraft s new credit agreement  at december   we have an outstanding credit facility consisting of a term loan and revolving credit facility totaling million 
the initial term loan and the revolving credit facility have a maturity date of october  depending on the type of borrowing  the applicable interest rate under the credit facility is calculated at a per annum rate equal to a libor plus an applicable margin  which is currently for eurodollar loans  or b i the greatest of x the prime rate  y the federal funds effective rate plus or z one month libor plus plus ii an applicable margin  which is currently for base rate loans 
the unused portion of the revolver will also be subject to an unused fee that will be calculated at a per annum rate the unused fee rate  which is currently 
commencing with the delivery of the financial statements for the fiscal quarter ending december   the applicable margin for borrowings under the credit facility and the unused fee rate will be determined by reference to a pricing grid based on the company s total leverage ratio

for instance  if the bank s libor rate was to increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our expected future monthly loan balances per our existing repayment schedule 
commodity prices we are exposed to price fluctuations of certain commodities used in production 
key materials and energy used in the production process include roundwood and woodchips  recycled fiber  containerboard  fuel oil  natural gas  electricity and caustic soda 
we purchase these materials and energy at market prices  and do not use forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge our exposure to price risk related to these commodities 
we have three contracts to purchase coal at fixed prices through december  we are exposed to price fluctuations in the price of our finished goods 
the prices we charge for our products are primarily based on market conditions 
foreign currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations as we invoice certain european customers in euros 
the company used foreign currency forward contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage some of the foreign currency exchange risks associated with foreign sales of its us operations during using such foreign currency forward contracts  the company received or paid the difference between the contracted forward rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date 
these contracts were used to hedge the variability of exchange rates on the company s cash flows 
no such contracts were outstanding at december  and
