critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of products or the performance of services when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions 
the company defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
when a sales agreement involves multiple deliverables  such as extended support provisions  training to be supplied after delivery of the systems  and test programs specific to customers routine applications  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting 
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of multiple element transactions and the manner in which revenue is allocated among the accounting units 
judgments made  or changes to judgments made  may significantly affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
revenue related to the multiple elements are allocated to each unit of accounting using the relative selling price hierarchy 
consistent with accounting guidance  the selling price is based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
if vsoe is not available  third party evidence tpe is used to establish the selling price 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe  estimated selling price is used 
we have adopted this guidance effective with the first quarter of fiscal prior to fiscal  revenue for arrangements containing multiple deliverables was allocated based upon estimated fair values 
the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sales tax collected from customers is not included in net sales but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities 
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
royalty based revenue related to licensing income from performance test boards and burn in boards is recognized upon the earlier of the receipt by the company of the licensee s report related to its usage of the licensed intellectual property or upon payment by the licensee 
the company s terms of sales with distributors are generally free on board  or fob  shipping point with payment due within days 
all products go through in house testing and verification of specifications before shipment 
apart from warranty reserves  credits issued have not been material as a percentage of net sales 
the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of the company s products 
instead  the distributors place orders with the company at or about the time they receive orders from their customers 
the company s shipment terms to our distributors do not provide for credits or rights of return 
because the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of our products  they do not have rights to price protection or to return products 
at the time the company ships products to the distributors  the price is fixed 
subsequent to the issuance of the invoice  there are no discounts or special terms 
the company does not give the buyer the right to return the product or to receive future price concessions 
the company s arrangements do not include vendor consideration 
product development costs and capitalized software the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
no system software development costs were capitalized or amortized in fiscal  or allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible trade receivables 
the company also reviews its trade receivables by aging category to identify specific customers with known disputes or collection issues 
the company exercises judgment when determining the adequacy of these reserves as the company evaluates historical bad debt trends  general economic conditions in the united states and internationally and changes in customer financial conditions 
uncollectible receivables are recorded as bad debt expense when all efforts to collect have been exhausted and recoveries are recognized when they are received 
warranty obligations the company provides and records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized on products shipped 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the company s estimate of warranty reserve is based on management s assessment of future warranty obligations and on historical warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect how the company accounts for expenses 
inventory obsolescence in each of the last three fiscal years  the company has written down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in the company s acquisition of its japanese subsidiary 
the company reviews goodwill annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred 
based on the fair market value of the company s common stock relative to its book value and revised estimates for its future cash flow and revenue projections  the company determined that indicators of impairment for its goodwill were present during fiscal year as a result  the company tested the goodwill for impairment  determined that it was impaired and recorded a non cash impairment of goodwill charge of  for the fiscal year ended may   bringing the net value to zero 
both gross goodwill and accumulated impairment were each  at may   and investment impairment the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes income taxes have been provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are utilized 
valuation allowances are established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
during the fiscal year ended may  a partial release of the valuation allowance previously established was made based upon the company s current level of profitability and the level of forecasted future earnings 
during fiscal  a full valuation allowance was established against all deferred tax assets as management determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions consistent with authoritative guidance 
the guidance prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company does not expect any material change in its unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes 
although the company files us federal  various state and foreign tax returns  the company s only major tax jurisdictions are the united states  california  germany and japan 
tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies due to tax loss carryovers from those years 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of expenses for stock options and employee stock purchase plan  or espp  shares 
stock based compensation cost is measured at each grant date  based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
this model was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of publicly traded options 
all of the company s stock compensation is accounted for as an equity instrument 
the fair value of each option grant and the right to purchase shares under the company s stock purchase plan are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with assumptions concerning expected term  stock price volatility  expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate and the expected life of the award 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the seven officers of the company elected to forfeit certain stock options previously granted 
the forfeiture of these options resulted in the immediate recognition of the unamortized portion of stock compensation expense of million

see notes and for detailed information regarding the stock option plan and the espp

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at may  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company only invests its short term excess cash in government backed securities with maturities of months or less 
the company maintained a cost basis equity investment in a privately held company  esa electronics pte ltd through may this investment was sold in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
the company  however  enters into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent that the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the japanese subsidiary s financial statements are based in yen and the company s condensed consolidated financial statements are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize foreign exchange gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the yen as compared with the us dollar would not be expected to result in a significant change to the company s net income or loss 
there have been no material changes in our risk exposure since the end of fiscal  nor are any material changes to our risk exposure anticipated
