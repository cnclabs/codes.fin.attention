the company recorded a  goodwill impairment charge in accordance with asc topic during the fourth quarter of fiscal refer to item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
during  the company recorded non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
the majority of this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the u 
s is necessary 
accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
if a cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary

during fiscal we initiated projects to strategically reorganize our north american hoist and rigging operations  which were essentially completed during the first quarter of fiscal the projects included the closure of two manufacturing facilities and the significant downsizing of a third facility 
the closures and downsizing resulted in a reduction of approximately  square feet of manufacturing space or approximately of total manufacturing space 
additionally our revenue base is now more geographically diverse than at any time in our company s history  with approximately derived from customers outside the us for the fiscal year ending march  we believe this will help balance the impact of changes that will occur in local economies as well as benefit the company from growth in emerging markets

we purchase approximately  to  of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
generally  as we experience fluctuations in our costs  we reflect them as price increases or surcharges to our customers with the goal of being margin neutral 
some of our steel costs have increased during this year as a result of higher scrap and alloy surcharges

the net cash generated in fiscal was due to the refinancing of the  outstanding notes with a new issuance of  notes 
offsetting the proceeds from the offering was  paid for tender and call redemption premiums on the notes and  paid for direct financing costs which have been deferred 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon successful execution of our current business plan and effective working capital utilization 
no material restrictions exist in accessing cash held by our non us subsidiaries 
additionally we expect to meet our us funding needs without repatriating non us cash and incurring the incremental non us taxes 
as of march    of cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries 
we have an amended  restated and expanded revolving credit facility dated december  the revolving credit facility provides availability up to a maximum of  and expires december  provided there is no default  we may  on a one time basis  request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding  subject to lender approval

our actual fixed charges coverage ratio and total leverage ratio  as calculated per the terms of our revolving credit facility  were x and x  respectively  at march  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company refinanced its notes through the issuance of  principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended unregistered notes 
the proceeds from the sale of the unregistered notes were used to repurchase or redeem all of the outstanding notes amounting to  and to fund working capital and other corporate activities 
the offering price of the unregistered notes was after adjustment for the original issue discount 
provisions of the unregistered notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restrictive payments 
until february   the company may redeem up to of the outstanding unregistered notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of equity offerings  subject to certain restrictions 
on or after february   the unregistered notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at a redemption price of  reducing to on february  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the unregistered notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s unregistered notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the unregistered notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future us subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company exchanged its  outstanding unregistered notes for a like principal amount of senior subordinated notes due registered under the securities act of  as amended notes 
all of the unregistered notes were exchanged in the transaction 
the notes contain identical terms and provisions as the unregistered notes

our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of  to  excluding acquisitions and strategic partnerships 

table of contents inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in non us economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  us employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of  payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note was recorded at its estimated net realizable value of at the time of the divestiture 
principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly   and  of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  and respectively  net of tax 
all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
the company expects that the loan will be fully collected by the end of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  but generally does not require collateral to support customer receivables 
the credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and do not accrue interest 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 

table of contents the pension discount rate assumptions of   and  as of march    and  respectively  are based on long term aa rated corporate and municipal bond rates 
the decrease in the discount rate for fiscal resulted in a  increase in the projected benefit obligation 
the decrease in the discount rates for fiscal resulted in an  increase in the projected benefit obligation as of march  the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the targeted plan asset allocation approximately equities and fixed income and their long term historical returns 
our under funded status for all pension plans as of march  and was  and  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately  and  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate  slightly less than the fiscal amount of  which includes a curtailment charge of  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year is expected to increase by approximately  compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march    and is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns 
the healthcare costs inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal   and  respectively  are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
these actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors  including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims  trends or changes in claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations 
as a result  actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable aging 
accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection efforts have been exhausted 
at march  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment amounts in millions balance as of march  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment may exist if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by appropriate valuation techniques 
goodwill impairment testing 
our goodwill balance   as of march  is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of the end of february  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

table of contents we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units for example  similar products and or services  similar long term financial results  product processes  classes of customers  etc we have four reporting units  only two of which have goodwill 
our duff norton reporting unit and rest of products reporting unit have goodwill totaling  and  respectively  at march  when we evaluate the potential for goodwill impairment  we assess a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel and overall financial performance 
if  after completing this assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test 
in order to perform the two step impairment test  we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the discounted cash flow method incorporates various assumptions  the most significant being projected revenue growth rates  operating profit margins and cash flows  the terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
management projects revenue growth rates  operating margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current business  expected developments and operational strategies over a five year period 
in estimating the terminal growth rate  we consider our historical and projected results  as well as the economic environment in which our reporting units operate 
the discount rates utilized for each reporting unit reflect management s assumptions of marketplace participants cost of capital and risk assumptions  both specific to the reporting unit and overall in the economy 
we performed our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than that its applicable carrying value 
accordingly  we did not perform the two step goodwill impairment test for any of our reporting units 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
we also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a non cash charge of  included within its provision for income taxes 
the balance of the valuation allowance at march  is  this charge relates to the company s determination that a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets generated in the us was necessary 
the deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities related to employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  us tax credits  and us net operating loss carryforwards 
the us net operating loss carryforwards have been generated primarily as a result of restructuring costs in fiscal years and accounting rules require a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available and objectively verifiable evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the existence of cumulative losses for a certain threshold period is a significant form of negative evidence used in the assessment 
during the third quarter ended december   the company determined that it would be in a three year cumulative pretax loss position in the us at march  primarily due to restructuring related charges incurred in the us to date in fiscal  despite our expectations of future profitability 
if a cumulative loss threshold is met  the accounting rules indicate that forecasts of future profitability are generally not sufficient positive evidence to overcome the presumption that a valuation allowance is necessary 
the recording of this non cash charge does not impact the company s ability to realize the economic benefit of its deferred tax assets including those related to net operating loss carryforwards amounting to  on a gross basis at march  on future tax returns 
in future periods  the allowance could be reduced or reversed based on sufficient objectively verifiable evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
if we were to experience an ownership change  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation determined by multiplying the market value of our outstanding shares of stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years within the allowed nol carryforward period 
the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change 
effects of new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
among the new provisions in asu was a requirement for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements  however this reclassification requirement is indefinitely deferred by asu and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the update requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the asu is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods therein 
we are currently evaluating the impact this update will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendment permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing relevant events or circumstances  an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to follow the existing provisions of the two step impairment test 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the new guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test  which we tested as of our measurement date of february  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu  effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the issuance of asu is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu supersedes the presentation options in asc topic and facilitates convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the company does not expect that the adoption of asu will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs asu 
asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board the boards on fair value measurements 
the collective efforts of the boards and their staffs  reflected in asu  have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
the boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this asu are required to be applied prospectively  and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of asu will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
