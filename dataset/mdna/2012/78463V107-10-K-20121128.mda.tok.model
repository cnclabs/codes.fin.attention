investment objective the shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the gold market through an investment in securities 
historically  the logistics of buying  storing and insuring gold have constituted a barrier to entry for some institutional and retail investors 
the ownership of the shares is intended to overcome these barriers to entry 
the logistics of storing and insuring gold are dealt with by the custodian  and the related expenses are built into the price of the shares 
therefore  the investor does not have any additional tasks or costs over and above those associated with investing in any other publicly traded security 
the shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost efficient means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding allocated gold bullion 
the shares offer an investment that is easily accessible 
investors can access the gold market through a traditional brokerage account 
the sponsor believes that investors will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use gold by using the shares instead of using the traditional means of purchasing  trading and holding gold 
relatively cost efficient 
the sponsor believes that  for many investors  transaction costs related to the shares will be lower than those associated with the purchase  storage and insurance of allocated gold 
exchange traded 
the shares trade on nyse arca  inc  or nyse arca  providing investors with an efficient means to buy  sell  or sell short in order to implement a variety of investment strategies 
the shares are eligible for margin accounts 
the shares are also listed on the mexican stock exchange bolsa mexicana de valores  the singapore exchange securities trading limited  the stock exchange of hong kong limited and the tokyo stock exchange 
backed by gold held by the custodian on behalf of the trust 
the shares are backed by the assets of the trust and the trust does not hold or employ any derivative securities 
further  the trust s holdings and their value based on current market prices are reported on the trust s website each business day 

table of contents overview the shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the trust 
the trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle 
the gold held by the trust will only be sold on an as needed basis to pay trust expenses  in the event the trust terminates and liquidates its assets  or as otherwise required by law or regulation 
the sale of gold by the trust is a taxable event to shareholders of the trust  or shareholders 
see united states federal tax consequences taxation of us shareholders 
the trust is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act of and is not required to register under such act 
the trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the commodity exchange act of  or the cea  as administered by the commodity futures trading commission  or the cftc 
the trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the cea  and none of the sponsor  the trustee or the marketing agent is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the shares 
the trust creates and redeems shares from time to time  but only in baskets 
the number of outstanding shares changes from time to time as a result of the creation and redemption of baskets 
the creation and redemption of baskets requires the delivery to the trust or the distribution by the trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed 
the total amount of gold and any cash required for the creation of baskets is based on the combined net asset value  or nav  of the number of baskets being created or redeemed 
the number of ounces of gold required to create a basket or to be delivered upon the redemption of a basket will continue to gradually decrease over time 
this is because the shares comprising a basket will represent a decreasing amount of gold due to the sale of the trust s gold to pay the trust s expenses 
baskets may be created or redeemed only by authorized participants 
an authorized participant is a person who is a registered broker dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker dealer to engage in securities transactions  is a participant in the depository trust company system  or dtc  has entered into an agreement with the sponsor and the trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the gold and any cash required for such creations and redemptions  or a participant agreement  and has established an unallocated gold account with the custodian  or an authorized participant unallocated account 
authorized participants pay a transaction fee of  for each order to create or redeem baskets 
authorized participants may sell to other investors all or part of the shares included in the baskets they purchase from the trust 
as of the london pm fix on each day that nyse arca is open for regular trading or  if there is no london pm fix on such day or the london pm fix has not been announced by pm new york time on such day  as of pm new york time on such day  or valuation time  the trustee values the gold held by the trust and determines both the adjusted net asset value  or anav  and the nav of the trust 
once the value of the gold has been determined  the trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees other than the fees accruing for the evaluation day which are computed by reference to the anav of the trust or the custody fees accruing for the evaluation day which are based on the value of the gold held by the trust  expenses and other liabilities of the trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the trust other than any amounts credited to the trust s reserve account  if established 
the resulting figure is the anav of the trust  which is used to compute the fees of the sponsor  the trustee and the marketing agent 
to determine the trust s nav  the trustee subtracts the amount of estimated accrued fees accruing for the evaluation day which are computed by reference to the anav of the trust and to the value of the gold held by the trust from the anav of the trust 
the resulting figure is the nav of the trust 
the trustee also determines the nav per share by dividing the nav of the trust by the number of the shares outstanding as of the close of trading on nyse arca which includes the net number of any shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day 

table of contents the trust s assets only consist of allocated gold bullion and gold receivable when recorded  representing gold covered by contractually binding orders for the creation of shares where the gold has not yet been transferred to the trust s account and  from time to time  cash  which will be used to pay expenses 
cash held by the trust will not generate any income 
the trust does not hold any derivative instruments 
each share represents a proportional interest  based on the total number of shares outstanding  in the gold and any cash held by the trust  less the trust s liabilities which include accrued expenses 
while the secondary market trading price of the shares has fluctuated in response to the price of gold  the sponsor believes that the trading price of the shares reflects the estimated accrued expenses of the trust 
sales of gold the trustee  at the direction of the sponsor or in its own discretion  sells the trust s gold as necessary to pay the trust s expenses 
as a result  the amount of gold sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the trust s expenses and the market price of gold 
unless otherwise directed by the sponsor  when selling gold  the trustee endeavors to sell at the price established by the london pm fix 
the trustee places orders with dealers which may be the custodian through which the trustee expects to receive the most favorable price and execution of orders 
the custodian may be the purchaser of such gold only if the sale transaction is made at the next london gold price fix either am or pm following the sale order 
neither the trustee nor the sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale 
see united states federal tax consequences taxation of us shareholders for information on the tax treatment of gold sales 
the trustee may also sell the trust s gold if the sponsor notifies the trustee that the sale of gold is required by applicable law or regulation or in connection with the termination and liquidation of the trust 
the trustee will not be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale of gold directed by the sponsor 
any property received by the trust other than gold  cash or an amount receivable in cash such as  for example  an insurance claim will be promptly sold or otherwise disposed of by the trustee 
gold price information investors may obtain on a hour basis gold pricing information based on the spot price for an ounce of gold from various financial information service providers 
current spot prices are also generally available with bid ask spreads from gold bullion dealers 
in addition  the trust s website provides ongoing pricing information for gold spot prices and the shares 
market prices for the shares are available from a variety of sources including brokerage firms  information websites and other information service providers 
the nav of the trust is published by the sponsor on each day that nyse arca is open for regular trading and is posted on the trust s website at www

the gold industry gold supply and demand gold is a physical asset that is accumulated  rather than consumed 
as a result  virtually all the gold that has ever been mined still exists today in one form or another 
gold survey  a publication of thompson reuters gfms limited  or gfms  an independent precious metals research organization based in london  estimates that existing above ground stocks of gold amounted to  tonnes approximately billion ounces at the end of these stocks have increased by approximately per year on average for the years ended december when used in this annual report tonne refers to one metric tonne  which is equivalent to  kilograms or  troy ounces 

table of contents world gold supply and demand the following table sets forth a summary of the world gold supply and demand for the last years 
it is based on information reported in the thomson reuters gfms gold survey world gold supply and demand  mine production official sector sales old gold scrap net producer hedging total reported supply gold fabrication in carat jewelry gold fabrication in electronics gold fabrication in other industrial decorative applications gold fabrication in dentistry official sector purchases bar coin retail investment investment in exchange traded funds and related products total identifiable demand supply less demand figures may not add due to independent rounding

this is the residual from combining all the other data in the table 
the residual results from the fact that there is no reliable methodology for measuring all elements of gold supply and demand 
it includes net institutional investment other than that in exchange traded funds and similar products  movements in stocks and other elements together with any residual error 
bar coin retail investment include physical bars  official coins  imitation coins and medals 
source thomson reuters gfms gold survey sources of gold supply based on data from the gfms gold survey  gold supply averaged  tonnes one metric tonne is equivalent to  kilograms or  troy ounces per year between and sources of gold supply include both mine production and the recycling or mobilizing of existing above ground stocks 
the largest portion of gold supplied into the market generally comes from gold mine production  which averaged approximately  tonnes per year from through the second largest source of annual gold supply is from recycled gold  which is gold that has been recovered from jewelry and other fabricated products and converted back into marketable gold  recycled gold averaged approximately  tonnes annually for the period through official sector sales including central banks and supranational organizations activity outstripped purchases in the period from to  creating additional net supply of gold into the marketplace 
between and  official sector annual net sales averaged tonnes 
in recent years  however  the pace of net sales slowed sharply and  since the second quarter of  the official sector has been a net buyer of gold 
the year marked the second full year in more than two decades that the official sector had become a net buyer  with purchases averaging tonnes for the two years ended the prominence given by market commentators to this activity coupled with the total amount of gold held by the official sector  has resulted in this area being one of the more visible shifts in the gold market 
sources of gold demand based on data from the gfms gold survey  identifiable demand for gold which excludes over the counter transactions averaged  tonnes per year between and gold demand 
table of contents generally comes from three sources jewelry  investment  and industry including medical applications 
the primary source of demand comes from jewelry  which accounted for of the identifiable demand for the period from through identifiable investment demand accounted for of total demand  industry applications accounted for and the remaining of demand was from official sector buying 
while jewelry remains the largest component of demand  which represented just under  tonnes or of total identifiable demand in  has decreased almost tonnes to just under  tonnes or of identifiable demand in  its share has decreased over recent years in favor of investment demand  due in part to the financial crisis 
identifiable investment demand which includes bars and coins  as well as  exchange traded funds  has increased from less than tonnes in to approximately  tonnes in  which represents a shift in demand from of identifiable demand in to in additionally  marked the second consecutive year the official sector became a net purchaser of gold for first time in over two decades 
gold demand is widely dispersed throughout the world with significant contributions from india and china 
while there are seasonal fluctuations in the levels of demand for gold especially jewelry in many countries  variations in the timing of such fluctuations by country mean that seasonal changes in demand do not appear to have a significant impact on the global gold price 
operation of the gold bullion market the global trade in gold consists of over the counter  or otc  transactions in spot  forwards  and options and other derivatives  together with exchange traded futures and options 
global over the counter market the otc market trades on a hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading 
market makers  as well as others in the otc market  trade with each other and with their clients on a principal to principal basis 
all risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction 
market makers include the eleven market making members of the london bullion market association  or lbma  a trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the london bullion market 
the eleven market making members of the lbma are the bank of nova scotia scotiamocatta  barclays bank plc  credit suisse  deutsche bank ag  goldman sachs international  hsbc bank usa  na jpmorgan chase bank  mitsui co precious metals inc  merrill lynch international bank limited  soci t g n rale and ubs ag 
the otc market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes  price  size  destinations for delivery and other factors 
bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients requirements 
the otc market has no formal structure and no open outcry meeting place 
the main centers of the otc market are london  new york and zurich 
mining companies  central banks  manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products  together with investors and speculators  tend to transact their business through one of these market centers 
centers such as dubai and several cities in the far east also transact substantial otc market business  typically involving jewelry and small bars of kilogram or less 
bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the world s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the lbma 
of the eleven market making members of the lbma  six offer clearing services 
there are full members  including the market making members  plus a number of associate members around the world 
the information about lbma members in this report is as of october  these numbers may change from time to time as new members are added and existing members drop out 
in the otc market  the standard size of gold trades between market makers ranges between  and  ounces 
bid offer spreads are typically per ounce 
certain dealers are willing to offer clients competitive prices for much larger volumes  including trades over  ounces  although this will vary according to the dealer  the client and market conditions  as transaction costs in the otc market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely 
cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers 

table of contents liquidity in the otc market can vary from time to time during the course of the hour trading day 
fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads the differential between a dealer s buy and sell prices 
the period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the european time zones overlaps with trading in the united states  which is when otc market trading in london  new york and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange  or the comex 
this period lasts for approximately four hours each new york business day morning 
the london bullion market although the market for physical gold is global  most otc market trades are cleared through london 
in addition to coordinating market activities  the lbma acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators 
a primary function of the lbma is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the london good delivery lists  which are the lists of lbma accredited melters and assayers of gold 
the lbma also coordinates market clearing and vaulting  promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation 
the term loco london gold refers to gold physically held in london that meets the specifications for weight  dimensions  fineness or purity  identifying marks including the assay stamp of a lbma acceptable refiner and appearance set forth in the good delivery rules for gold and silver bars published by the lbma 
gold bars meeting these requirements are described in this report from time to time as london good delivery bars 
the unit of trade in london is the troy ounce  whose conversion between grams is  grams troy ounces and troy ounce grams 
a london good delivery bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the otc market 
typically referred to as ounce bars  a london good delivery bar must contain between and fine troy ounces of gold  with a minimum fineness or purity of parts per   be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack 
the fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar expressed in units of troy ounces by the fineness of the bar 
a london good delivery bar must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the lbma approved list 
unless otherwise specified  the gold spot price always refers to that of a london good delivery bar 
business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems 
twice daily during london trading hours there is a fix which provides reference gold prices for that day s trading 
many long term contracts will be priced on the basis of either the morning am or afternoon pm london fix  and market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations 
the london fix is the most widely used benchmark for daily gold prices and is quoted by various financial information sources 
formal participation in the london fix is traditionally limited to five members  each of which is a bullion dealer and a member of the lbma 
the chairmanship rotates annually among the five member firms 
the fix takes place by telephone and the five member firms no longer meet face to face as was previously the case 
the morning session of the fix starts at am london time and the afternoon session starts at pm london time 
the current members of the gold fixing are bank of nova scotia scotiamocatta  barclays bank plc  deutsche bank ag  hsbc bank usa  na  and soci t g n rale 
any other market participant wishing to participate in the trading on the fix is required to do so through one of the five gold fixing members 
orders are placed either with one of the five fixing members or with another bullion dealer who will then be in contact with a fixing member during the fixing 
the fixing members net off all orders when communicating their net interest at the fixing 
the fix begins with the fixing chairman suggesting a trying price  reflecting the market price prevailing at the opening of the fix 
this is relayed by the fixing members to their dealing rooms which have direct communication with all interested parties 
any market participant may enter the fixing process at any time  or adjust or withdraw his order 
the gold price is adjusted up or down until all the buy and sell orders are matched  at which time the price is 
table of contents declared fixed 
all fixing orders are transacted on the basis of this fixed price  which is instantly relayed to the market through various media 
the london fix is widely viewed as a full and fair representation of all market interest at the time of the fix 
futures exchanges the most significant gold futures exchanges are the comex  the chicago board of trade  or cbot  and the tokyo commodity exchange  or tocom 
the comex and the cbot both began to offer trading in gold futures contracts in for most of the period since that date  the comex has been the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options 
trading volumes in gold futures on the cbot have  however  sometimes exceeded those on the comex 
in july  the chicago mercantile exchange  or cme  merged with the cbot to form the cme group 
on august   the cme group acquired nymex holdings  inc  including the comex 
the tocom has been trading gold since trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded 
trading costs are negotiable 
as a matter of practice  only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded 
both exchanges permit trading on margin 
margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder 
the comex operates through a central clearance system 
on june   tocom adopted a similar clearance system 
in each case  the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes 
other exchanges there are other gold exchange markets  such as the istanbul gold exchange trading gold since  the shanghai gold exchange trading gold since october and the hong kong chinese gold silver exchange society trading gold since 
market regulation the global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self regulatory organizations 
in addition  certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants 
movements in the price of gold since the inception of the trust as movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the shares  investors should understand what the recent movements in the price of gold have been 
investors  however  should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements 

table of contents the following chart provides historical background on the price of gold 
the chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in us dollars per ounce over the period from the day the shares began trading on the nyse on november  to september   and is based on the london pm fix 
daily gold price november  to september  logo business of the trust the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion  less the trust s expenses 
the sponsor believes that  for many investors  the shares represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in gold 
the trust has no fixed termination date and will terminate upon the occurence of a termination event listed in the trust indenture 
creation and redemption of shares the trust creates and redeems shares from time to time  but only in one or more baskets a basket equals a block of  shares 
the creation and redemption of baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the trust or the distribution by the trust of the amount of gold and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed  the amount of which is based on the combined nav of the number of shares included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received 
authorized participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets 
to become an authorized participant  a person must enter into a participant agreement with the sponsor and the trustee 
the participant agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by the trustee and the sponsor without the consent of any shareholder or authorized participant 
authorized participants who make deposits with the trust in exchange for baskets receive no fees  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the sponsor or the trust  and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to the sponsor or the trust to effect any sale or resale of shares 

table of contents some of the activities of authorized participants will result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner which would render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act 
as of the date of this annual report  barclays capital inc  citigroup global markets inc  credit suisse securities usa llc  deutsche bank securities inc  goldman  sachs co  goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  hsbc securities usa inc  lp morgan securities inc  merrill lynch professional clearing corp  morgan stanley co 
incorporated  newedge usa llc  rbc capital markets corporation  scotia capital usa inc  ubs securities llc  virtu financial capital markets  llc f k a ewt  llc and virtu financial bd llc are the only authorized participants 
an updated list of authorized participants can be obtained from the trustee or the sponsor 
prior to initiating any creation or redemption order  an authorized participant must have entered into an agreement with the custodian to establish an authorized participant unallocated account in london  or a participant unallocated bullion account agreement 
authorized participant unallocated accounts may only be used for transactions with the trust 
an unallocated account is an account with a bullion dealer  which may also be a bank  to which a fine weight amount of gold is credited 
transfers to or from an unallocated account are made by crediting or debiting the number of ounces of gold being deposited or withdrawn 
the account holder is entitled to direct the bullion dealer to deliver an amount of physical gold equal to the amount of gold standing to the credit of the account holder 
gold held in an unallocated account is not segregated from the custodian s assets 
the account holder therefore has no ownership interest in any specific bars of gold that the bullion dealer holds or owns 
the account holder is an unsecured creditor of the bullion dealer  and credits to an unallocated account are at risk of the bullion dealer s insolvency  in which event it may not be possible for a liquidator to identify any gold held in an unallocated account as belonging to the account holder rather than to the bullion dealer 
certain authorized participants are able to participate directly in the gold bullion market and the gold futures market 
in some cases  an authorized participant may from time to time acquire gold from or sell gold to its affiliated gold trading desk  which may profit in these instances 
the sponsor believes that the size and operation of the gold bullion market make it unlikely that an authorized participant s direct activities in the gold or securities markets will impact the price of gold or the price of the shares 
authorized participants must be a dtc participant and must be registered as a broker dealer under the exchange act  and regulated by finra  or will be exempt from being or otherwise will not be required to be so regulated or registered  and will be qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires 
each authorized participant will have its own set of rules and procedures  internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime 
authorized participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker dealers  custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem baskets 
an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized participant on behalf of multiple clients 
persons interested in purchasing baskets should contact the sponsor or the trustee to obtain the contact information for the authorized participants 
shareholders who are not authorized participants will only be able to redeem their shares through an authorized participant 
all gold bullion must be delivered to the trust and distributed by the trust in unallocated form through credits and debits between authorized participant unallocated accounts and the trust unallocated account 
all gold bullion must be of at least a minimum fineness or purity of parts per  and otherwise conform to the rules  regulations practices and customs of the lbma  including the specifications for a london good delivery bar 
under the participant agreement  the sponsor has agreed to indemnify the authorized participants against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the securities act  and to contribute to the payments the authorized participants may be required to make in respect of those liabilities 
the trustee has agreed to reimburse the authorized participants  solely from and to the extent of the trust s assets  for 
table of contents indemnification and contribution amounts due from the sponsor to the extent the sponsor has not paid such amounts when due 
the following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and investors should review the description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets set forth in the trust indenture  the form of participant agreement and the form of participant unallocated bullion account agreement  each of which have been filed as exhibits 
creation procedures on any business day  an authorized participant may place an order with the trustee to create one or more baskets 
purchase orders must be placed by pm or the close of regular trading on nyse arca  whichever is earlier 
the day on which the trustee receives a valid purchase order is the purchase order date 
by placing a purchase order  an authorized participant agrees to deposit gold with the trust  or a combination of gold and cash  as described below 
prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order  the authorized participant must also have wired to the trustee the non refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order 
determination of required deposits the total deposit required to create each basket  or a creation basket deposit  is an amount of gold and cash  if any  that is in the same proportion to the total assets of the trust net of estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to purchase is properly received as the number of shares to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of shares outstanding on the date the order is received 
delivery of required deposits an authorized participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its authorized participant unallocated account with the required gold deposit amount by the end of the second business day in london following the purchase order date 
upon receipt of the gold deposit amount  the custodian  after receiving appropriate instructions from the authorized participant and the trustee  will transfer on the third business day following the purchase order date the gold deposit amount from the authorized participant unallocated account to the trust unallocated account and the trustee will direct dtc to credit the number of baskets ordered to the authorized participant s dtc account 
the expense and risk of delivery  ownership and safekeeping of gold until such gold has been received by the trust will be borne solely by the authorized participant 
if gold is to be delivered other than as described above  the sponsor is authorized to establish such procedures and to appoint such custodians and establish such custody accounts as the sponsor determines to be desirable 
acting on standing instructions given by the trustee  the custodian will transfer the gold deposit amount from the trust unallocated account to the trust allocated account by allocating to the trust allocated account specific bars of gold from unallocated bars which the custodian holds or instructing a subcustodian to allocate specific bars of gold from unallocated bars held by or for the subcustodian 
the gold bars in an allocated gold account are specific to that account and are identified by a list which shows  for each gold bar  the refiner  assay or fineness  serial number and gross and fine weight 
gold held in the trust s allocated account is the property of the trust and is not traded  leased or loaned under any circumstances

united states federal tax consequences the following discussion of the material united states federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase  ownership and disposition of shares by a us shareholder as defined below  and certain united states federal income  gift and estate tax consequences that may apply to an investment in shares by a non us shareholder as defined below  represents  insofar as it describes conclusions as to us federal tax law and subject to the limitations and qualifications described therein  the opinion of carter ledyard milburn llp  special united states federal tax counsel to the sponsor 

table of contents the discussion below is based on the united states internal revenue code of  as amended  or code  treasury regulations promulgated under the code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the code  all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively 
the tax treatment of shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances 
certain shareholders including broker dealers  traders or other investors with special circumstances may be subject to special rules not discussed below 
in addition  the following discussion applies only to investors who hold shares as capital assets within the meaning of code section moreover  the discussion below does not address the effect of any state  local or foreign tax law on an owner of shares 
purchasers of shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal  state  local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in shares 
for purposes of this discussion  a us shareholder is a shareholder that is an individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the united states for us federal income tax purposes  a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof  an estate  the income of which is includible in gross income for us federal income tax purposes regardless of its source  or a trust  if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust 
a shareholder that is not a us shareholder as defined above is generally considered a non us shareholder for purposes of this discussion 
for united states federal income tax purposes  the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership  including any entity treated as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes  will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership 
partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the united states federal income tax consequences of purchasing  owning and disposing of shares 
taxation of the trust the trust is treated as a grantor trust for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the trust itself will not pay us federal income tax 
instead  the trust s income and expenses flow through to the shareholders  and the trustee will report the trust s income  gains  losses and deductions to the internal revenue service  or irs  on that basis 
taxation of us shareholders shareholders generally will be treated  for us federal income tax purposes  as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held in the trust 
shareholders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata shares of the trust s income  if any  and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the trust s expenses 
in the case of a shareholder that purchases shares for cash  its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held in the trust at the time it acquires its shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the shares 
in the case of a shareholder that acquires its shares by delivering gold to the trust  the delivery of gold to the trust in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the shares will not be a taxable event to the shareholder  and the shareholder s tax basis and holding period for the shareholder s pro rata share of the gold held in the trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the gold delivered in exchange therefor 
for purposes of this discussion  it is assumed that all of a shareholder s shares are acquired on the same date  at the same price per share and  except where otherwise noted  that the sole asset of the trust is gold 
when the trust sells gold  for example to pay expenses  a shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the shareholder s pro rata share of the amount 
table of contents realized by the trust upon the sale and the shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold that was sold  which gain or loss will generally be long term or short term capital gain or loss  depending upon whether the shareholder has held its shares for more than one year 
a shareholder s tax basis for its share of any gold sold by the trust generally will be determined by multiplying the shareholder s total basis for its share of all of the gold held in the trust immediately prior to the sale  by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of gold sold and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold held in the trust immediately prior to the sale 
after any such sale  a shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold remaining in the trust will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the trust immediately prior to the sale  less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the gold that was sold 
upon a shareholder s sale of some or all of its shares  the shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the shares sold 
accordingly  the shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the shares  and the shareholder s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the shares sold  as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph 
a redemption of some or all of a shareholder s shares in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the shareholder 
the shareholder s tax basis for the gold received in the redemption generally will be the same as the shareholder s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the shares redeemed 
the shareholder s holding period with respect to the gold received should include the period during which the shareholder held the shares redeemed 
a subsequent sale of the gold received by the shareholder will be a taxable event 
after any sale or redemption of less than all of a shareholder s shares  the shareholder s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption  less the portion of such basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the shareholder upon such sale or  in the case of a redemption  which is treated as the basis of the gold received by the shareholder in the redemption 
as noted above  the foregoing discussion assumes that all of a shareholder s shares were acquired on the same date and at the same price per share 
if a shareholder owns multiple lots of shares ie  shares acquired on different dates and or at different prices  it is uncertain whether the shareholder may use the specific identification rules that apply under treas 
reg 
c in the case of sales of shares of stock  in determining the amount  and the long term or short term character  of any gain or loss recognized by the shareholder upon the sale of gold by the trust  upon the sale of any shares by the shareholder  or upon the sale by the shareholder of any gold received by it upon the redemption of any of its shares 
the irs could take the position that a shareholder has a blended tax basis and holding period for its pro rata share of the underlying gold in the trust 
shareholders that hold multiple lots of shares  or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of shares  should consult their own tax advisors as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying gold related to such shares 
maximum long term capital gains tax rate for us shareholders who are individuals under current law  gains recognized by individuals from the sale of collectibles  including gold bullion  held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of  rather than the rate applicable to most other long term capital gains 
for these purposes  gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of an interest in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles  to the extent that the gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in value of the collectibles held by the trust 
therefore  any gain recognized by an individual us shareholder attributable to a sale of shares held for more than one year  or attributable to the trust s sale of any gold bullion which the shareholder is 
table of contents treated through its ownership of shares as having held for more than one year  generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 
the tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual us shareholder for one year or less or by a taxpayer other than an individual us taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed 
tax on net investment income for taxable years beginning after december  the health care reform and education reconciliation act of pub 
law requires certain us shareholders who are individuals to pay a tax on the lesser of the excess of their modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount  for married persons filing jointly and  for single taxpayers or their net investment income  which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property  for taxable years beginning after december  this tax is in addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income 
a similar tax will apply to estates and trusts 
us shareholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect  if any  this law may have on an investment in the shares 
brokerage fees and trust expenses any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a shareholder in purchasing shares will be treated as part of the shareholder s tax basis in the underlying assets of the trust 
similarly  any brokerage fee incurred by a shareholder in selling shares will reduce the amount realized by the shareholder with respect to the sale 
shareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss upon a sale of gold by the trust as discussed above  even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the trustee to pay trust expenses 
shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense 
shareholders who are individuals  estates or trusts  however  may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions 
individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed of adjusted gross income 
in addition  such deductions may be subject to phase outs and other limitations under applicable provisions of the code 
investment by us tax exempt shareholders us tax exempt shareholders are subject to united states federal income tax only on their unrelated business taxable income  or ubti 
unless they incur debt in order to purchase shares  it is expected that us tax exempt shareholders should not realize ubti in respect of income or gains from the shares 
us tax exempt shareholders should consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the united states federal income tax consequences of holding shares in light of their particular circumstances 
investment by regulated investment companies mutual funds and other investment vehicles which are regulated investment companies within the meaning of code section should consult with their tax advisors concerning the likelihood that an investment in shares  although they are a security within the meaning of the investment company act of  may be considered an investment in the underlying gold for purposes of code section b  and the extent to which an investment in shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under code section investment by certain retirement plans code section m provides that the acquisition of a collectible by an individual retirement account  or ira  or a participant directed account maintained under any plan that is tax qualified under code section a  is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the ira  or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained  of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible 
the sponsor has received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that 
table of contents a purchase of shares by an ira  or by a participant directed account under a code section a plan  will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the ira owner or plan participant under code section m 
however  if any of the shares so purchased are distributed from the ira or plan account to the ira owner or plan participant  or if any gold received by such ira or plan account upon the redemption of any of the shares purchased by it is distributed to the ira owner or plan participant  the shares or gold so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of distribution  to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of code section d  section m or section see also erisa and related considerations 
us information reporting and backup withholding for us and us shareholders the trustee will file certain information returns with the irs  and provide certain tax related information to shareholders  in connection with the trust 
each shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the trust s annual income if any and expenses 
a us shareholder may be subject to us backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures 
non us shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not a us person in order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements 
the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a shareholder s us federal income tax liability and may entitle such a shareholder to a refund  provided that the required information is furnished to the irs 
income taxation of non us shareholders the trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gain if any upon the sale of gold 
a non us shareholder generally will not be subject to us federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of shares  or upon the sale of gold by the trust  unless the non us shareholder is an individual and is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition  and the gain is treated as being from united states sources  or the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non us shareholder of a trade or business in the united states and certain other conditions are met 
estate and gift tax considerations for non us shareholders under the us federal tax law  individuals who are neither citizens nor residents as determined for estate and gift tax purposes of the united states are subject to estate tax on all property that has a us situs 
shares may well be considered to have a us situs for these purposes 
if they are  then shares would be includible in the us gross estate of a non resident alien shareholder 
currently  us estate tax is imposed at rates of up to of the fair market value of the taxable estate 
the us estate tax rate is subject to change in future years 
in addition  the us federal generation skipping transfer tax may apply in certain circumstances 
the estate of a non resident alien shareholder who was resident in a country which has an estate tax treaty with the united states may be entitled to benefit from such treaty 
for non citizens and non residents of the united states  the us federal gift tax generally applies only to gifts of tangible personal property or real property having a us situs 
tangible personal property including gold has a us situs if it is physically located in the united states 
although the matter is not settled  it appears that ownership of shares should not be considered ownership of the underlying gold for this purpose  even to the extent that gold were held in custody in the united states 
instead  shares should be considered intangible property  and therefore they should not be subject to us gift tax if transferred during the holder s lifetime 
such shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of us estate  gift and generation skipping transfer taxes in their particular circumstances 

table of contents taxation in jurisdictions other than the united states prospective purchasers of shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the united states are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences  under the laws of such jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction not being the united states to which they are subject  of their purchase  holding  sale and redemption of or any other dealing in shares and  in particular  as to whether any value added tax  other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase  holding  sale  redemption or other dealing 
erisa and related considerations the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  or erisa  and or code section impose certain requirements on employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements  including individual retirement accounts and annuities  keogh plans  and certain collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested  that are subject to erisa and or the code  collectively the plans  and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as plan assets of a plan 
government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of erisa or the provisions of section of the code  but may be subject to substantially similar rules under state or other federal law 
in contemplating an investment of a portion of plan assets in shares  the plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider  taking into account the facts and circumstances of the plan  the risk factors discussed below and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities  including  but not limited to whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument  whether the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non exempt prohibited transaction with a party in interest  the plan s funding objectives  and whether under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification such investment is appropriate for the plan  taking into account the overall investment policy of the plan  the composition of the plan s investment portfolio and the plan s need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due 
the shares constitute publicly offered securities as defined in department of labor regulations b 
accordingly  shares purchased by a plan  and not the plan s interest in the underlying gold bullion held in the trust represented by the shares  should be treated as assets of the plan  for purposes of applying the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules of erisa and the code

item a 
risk factors you should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision 
you should also refer to the other information included in this report  including the trust s financial statements and the related notes 
the value of the shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the trust and fluctuations in the price of gold could materially adversely affect an investment in the shares 
the shares are designed to mirror as closely as possible the performance of the price of gold  and the value of the shares relates directly to the value of the gold held by the trust  less the trust s liabilities including estimated accrued expenses 
the price of gold has fluctuated widely over the past several years 
several factors may affect the price of gold  including global gold supply and demand  which is influenced by such factors as forward selling by gold producers  purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions  central bank purchases and sales  and production and cost levels in major gold producing countries such as south africa  the united states and australia  
table of contents global or regional political  economic or financial events and situations  investors expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  currency exchange rates  interest rates  and investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds 
the shares have experienced significant price fluctuations 
if gold markets continue to be subject to sharp fluctuations  this may result in potential losses if you need to sell your shares at a time when the price of gold is lower than it was when you made your investment 
even if you are able to hold shares for the long term  you may never experience a profit  since gold markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices  in addition to sharp fluctuations 
in addition  investors should be aware that there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long term value in terms of purchasing power in the future 
in the event that the price of gold declines  the sponsor expects the value of an investment in the shares to decline proportionately 
the amount of gold represented by the shares will continue to be reduced during the life of the trust due to the sales of gold necessary to pay the trust s expenses irrespective of whether the trading price of the shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold 
each outstanding share represents a fractional  undivided interest in the gold held by the trust 
the trust does not generate any income and regularly sells gold to pay for its ongoing expenses 
therefore  the amount of gold represented by each share has gradually declined over time 
this is also true with respect to shares that are issued in exchange for additional deposits of gold into the trust  as the amount of gold required to create shares proportionately reflects the amount of gold represented by the shares outstanding at the time of creation 
assuming a constant gold price  the trading price of the shares is expected to gradually decline relative to the price of gold as the amount of gold represented by the shares gradually declines 
investors should be aware that the gradual decline in the amount of gold represented by the shares will occur regardless of whether the trading price of the shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of gold 
the estimated ordinary operating expenses of the trust  which accrue daily commencing after the first day of trading of the shares  are described in business of the trust trust expenses 
the trust is a passive investment vehicle 
this means that the value of the shares may be adversely affected by trust losses that  if the trust had been actively managed  it might have been possible to avoid 
the trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the trust 
this means that the trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high  or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases 
it also means that the trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from price decreases 
any losses sustained by the trust will adversely affect the value of the shares 
the shares may trade at a price which is at  above or below the nav per share and any discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav per share may widen as a result of non concurrent trading hours between the comex and nyse arca 
the shares may trade at  above or below the nav per share 
the nav per share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the trust s assets 
the trading price of the shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the nav per share as well as market supply and demand 
the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the nav per share may be influenced by non concurrent trading hours between the comex and nyse arca 
while the shares trade on nyse arca until pm new york time  liquidity in the global gold market may be reduced after the close of the comex at pm new york time 
as a result  during this time  trading spreads  and the resulting premium or discount  on the shares may widen 

table of contents the sale of the trust s gold to pay expenses at a time of low gold prices could adversely affect the value of the shares 
the trustee sells gold held by the trust to pay trust expenses on an as needed basis irrespective of then current gold prices 
the trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell gold to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of gold 
consequently  the trust s gold may be sold at a time when the gold price is low  resulting in a negative effect on the value of the shares 
crises may motivate large scale sales of gold which could decrease the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the shares 
the possibility of large scale distress sales of gold in times of crisis may have a negative impact on the price of gold and adversely affect an investment in the shares 
for example  the asian financial crisis resulted in significant sales of gold by individuals which depressed the price of gold 
crises in the future may impair gold s price performance which would  in turn  adversely affect an investment in the shares 
purchasing activity in the gold market associated with the delivery of gold bullion to the trust in exchange for baskets may cause a temporary increase in the price of gold 
this increase may adversely affect an investment in the shares 
purchasing activity associated with acquiring the gold bullion required for deposit into the trust in connection with the creation of baskets may temporarily increase the market price of gold  which will result in higher prices for the shares 
temporary increases in the market price of gold may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants 
other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of gold that may result from increased purchasing activity of gold connected with the issuance of baskets 
consequently  the market price of gold may decline immediately after baskets are created 
if the price of gold declines  the trading price of the shares will also decline 
shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the investment company act of or the protections afforded by the cea 
the trust is not registered as an investment company under the investment company act of and is not required to register under such act 
consequently  shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies 
the trust will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts regulated by the cea  as administered by the cftc 
furthermore  the trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the cea  and none of the sponsor  the trustee or the marketing agent is subject to regulation by the cftc as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the shares 
consequently  shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in cea regulated instruments or commodity pools 
the trust may be required to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders 
if the trust is required to terminate and liquidate  such termination and liquidation could occur at a time which is disadvantageous to shareholders  such as when gold prices are lower than the gold prices at the time when shareholders purchased their shares 
in such a case  when the trust s gold is sold as part of the trust s liquidation  the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be less than if gold prices were higher at the time of sale 
the liquidity of the shares may also be affected by the withdrawal of authorized participants 
in the event that one of more authorized participants which has substantial interests in the shares withdraws from participation  the liquidity of the shares will likely decrease  which could adversely affect the market price of the shares 

table of contents the lack of an active trading market or a halt in trading of the shares may result in losses on investment at the time of disposition of the shares 
although shares are listed for trading on nyse arca  it cannot be assumed that an active trading market for the shares will be maintained 
if an investor needs to sell shares at a time when no active market for shares exists  or there is a halt in trading of securities generally or of the shares  this will most likely adversely affect the price the investor receives for the shares assuming the investor is able to sell them 
the price of gold may be affected by the sale of gold by etfs or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets 
to the extent existing exchange traded funds  or etfs  or other exchange traded vehicles tracking gold markets represent a significant proportion of demand for physical gold bullion  large redemptions of the securities of these etfs or other exchange traded vehicles could negatively affect physical gold bullion prices and the price and nav of the shares 
redemption orders are subject to postponement  suspension or rejection by the trustee under certain circumstances 
the trustee may  in its discretion  and will when directed by the sponsor  suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date  for any period during which nyse arca is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings  or trading on nyse arca is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which the delivery  disposal or evaluation of gold is not reasonably practicable  or for such other period as the sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of shareholders 
in addition  the trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the participant agreement or if the fulfillment of the order  in the opinion of its counsel  might be unlawful 
any such postponement  suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming shareholder 
for example  the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the shareholder s redemption distribution if the price of the shares declines during the period of the delay 
see creation and redemption of shares redemption procedures 
under the trust indenture  the sponsor and the trustee disclaim any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such suspension or postponement 
shareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other vehicles 
as interests in an investment trust  the shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation including  for example  the right to bring oppression or derivative actions 
in addition  the shares have limited voting and distribution rights for example  shareholders do not have the right to elect directors and will not receive dividends 
see description of the shares for a description of the limited rights of holders of shares 
an investment in the shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in gold 
the trust competes with other financial vehicles  including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold industry and other securities backed by or linked to gold  direct investments in gold and investment vehicles similar to the trust 
market and financial conditions  and other conditions beyond the sponsor s control  may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in gold directly  which could limit the market for the shares and reduce the liquidity of the shares 
substantial sales of gold by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the shares 
the official sector consists of central banks  other governmental agencies and multi lateral institutions that buy  sell and hold gold as part of their reserve assets 
the official sector holds a significant amount of gold  most of which is static  meaning that it is held in vaults and is not bought  sold  leased or swapped or otherwise mobilized in the open market 
a number of central banks have sold portions of their gold 
table of contents over the past years  with the result that the official sector  taken as a whole  has been a net supplier to the open market 
since  most sales have been made in a coordinated manner under the terms of the central bank gold agreement  as amended  under which of the world s major central banks including the european central bank agree to limit the level of their gold sales and lending to the market 
see the gold industry sources of gold supply and movements in the price of gold since the inception of the trust for more details 
in the event that future economic  political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to liquidate their gold assets all at once or in an uncoordinated manner  the demand for gold might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of gold to the market 
consequently  the price of gold could decline significantly  which would adversely affect an investment in the shares 
the estimated ordinary operating expenses of the trust  which accrue daily  are described in business of the trust trust expenses 
the trust s gold may be subject to loss  damage  theft or restriction on access 
there is a risk that some or all of the trust s gold bars held by the custodian or any subcustodian on behalf of the trust could be lost  damaged or stolen 
access to the trust s gold bars could also be restricted by natural events such as an earthquake or human actions such as a terrorist attack 
any of these events may adversely affect the operations of the trust and  consequently  an investment in the shares 
the trust may not have adequate sources of recovery if its gold is lost  damaged  stolen or destroyed and recovery may be limited  even in the event of fraud  to the market value of the gold at the time the fraud is discovered 
shareholders recourse against the trust  the trustee and the sponsor  under new york law  the custodian  under english law  and any subcustodians under the law governing their custody operations is limited 
the trust does not insure its gold 
the custodian maintains insurance with regard to its business on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate which does not cover the full amount of gold 
the trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence  nature or amount of coverage 
therefore  shareholders cannot be assured that the custodian will maintain adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the custodian on behalf of the trust 
in addition  the custodian and the trustee do not require any direct or indirect subcustodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the gold held by them on behalf of the trust 
consequently  a loss may be suffered with respect to the trust s gold which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages 
the liability of the custodian is limited under the custody agreements 
under the custody agreements  the custodian is only liable for losses that are the direct result of its own negligence  fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties 
any such liability is further limited  in the case of the allocated bullion account agreement  to the market value of the gold bars held in the trust s allocated gold account trust allocated account at the time such negligence  fraud or willful default is discovered by the custodian and  in the case of the unallocated bullion account agreement  to the amount of gold credited to the trust s unallocated gold account trust unallocated account at the time such negligence  fraud or willful default is discovered by the custodian 
the custodian is not contractually or otherwise liable for any losses suffered by any authorized participant or shareholder that are not the direct result of its own gross negligence  fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties under such agreement  and in no event will its liability exceed the market value of the balance in the authorized participant unallocated account at the time such gross negligence  fraud or willful default is discovered by the custodian 
in addition  the custodian will not be liable for any delay in performance or any non performance of any of its obligations under the custody agreements by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control  including acts of god  war or terrorism 
as a result  the recourse of the trustee or the investor  under english law  is limited 
furthermore  under english common law  the custodian or any subcustodian will 
table of contents not be liable for any delay in the performance or any non performance of its custodial obligations by reason of any cause beyond its reasonable control 
gold bars may be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the custodian  or employed by the subcustodians appointed by the custodian  until it is transported to the custodian s london vault premises 
under the allocated bullion account agreement  except for an obligation on the part of the custodian to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain delivery of the trust s gold bars from any subcustodians appointed by the custodian  the custodian is not liable for the acts or omissions of its subcustodians unless the selection of such subcustodians was made negligently or in bad faith 
there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between subcustodians that hold the trust s gold bars and the trustee or the custodian  because traditionally such arrangements are based on the lbma s rules and on the customs and practices of the london bullion market 
in the event of a legal dispute with respect to or arising from such arrangements  it may be difficult to define such customs and practices 
the lbma s rules may be subject to change outside the control of the trust 
under english law  neither the trustee  nor the custodian would have a supportable breach of contract claim against a subcustodian for losses relating to the safekeeping of gold 
if the trust s gold bars are lost or damaged while in the custody of a subcustodian  the trust may not be able to recover damages from the custodian or the subcustodian 
the obligations of the custodian under the allocated bullion account agreement  the unallocated bullion account agreement and the participant unallocated bullion account agreement are governed by english law 
the custodian may enter into arrangements with english subcustodians  which arrangements may also be governed by english law 
the trust is a new york investment trust 
any united states  new york or other court situated in the united states may have difficulty interpreting english law which  insofar as it relates to custody arrangements  is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute  lbma rules or the customs and practices in the london custody market 
it may be difficult or impossible for the trust to sue a subcustodian in a united states  new york or other court situated in the united states 
in addition  it may be difficult  time consuming and or expensive for the trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a united states  new york or other court situated in the united states 
if the trust s gold bars are lost  damaged  stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the trust  the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the trust s claim 
for example  as to a particular event of loss  the only source of recovery for the trust might be limited to the custodian  as currently it is the sole custodian holding all of the trust s gold  or one or more subcustodians  if appointed  or  to the extent identifiable  other responsible third parties eg  a thief or terrorist  any of which may not have the financial resources including liability insurance coverage to satisfy a valid claim of the trust 
neither the shareholders nor any authorized participant has a right under the custody agreements to assert a claim of the trustee against the custodian or any subcustodian  claims under the custody agreements may only be asserted by the trustee on behalf of the trust 
because neither the trustee nor the custodian oversees or monitors the activities of subcustodians who may temporarily hold the trust s gold bars until transported to the custodian s london vault  failure by the subcustodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the trust s gold bars could result in a loss to the trust 
under the allocated bullion account agreement  the custodian agreed that it will hold all of the trust s gold bars in its own vault premises except when the gold bars have been allocated in a vault other than the custodian s vault premises  and in such cases the custodian agreed that it will use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to transport the gold bars to the custodian s vault  at the custodian s cost and risk 
nevertheless  there will be periods of time when some portion of the trust s gold bars will be held by one or more subcustodians appointed by the custodian or by a subcustodian of such subcustodian 
the allocated bullion account agreement is described in description of the custody agreements 

table of contents the custodian is required under the allocated bullion account agreement to use reasonable care in appointing its subcustodians but otherwise has no other responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by it 
these subcustodians may in turn appoint further subcustodians  but the custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further subcustodians 
the custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions or their selection of further subcustodians 
the trustee does not undertake to monitor the performance of any subcustodian 
furthermore  the trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any subcustodian for the purposes of examining the trust s gold bars or any records maintained by the subcustodian  and no subcustodian will be obligated to cooperate in any review the trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities  procedures  records or creditworthiness of such subcustodian 
see custody of the trust s gold for more information about subcustodians that may hold the trust s gold 
in addition  the ability of the trustee to monitor the performance of the custodian may be limited because under the custody agreements the trustee has only limited rights to visit the premises of the custodian for the purpose of examining the trust s gold bars and certain related records maintained by the custodian 
the ability of the trustee and the custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited  which increases the possibility that the trust may suffer a loss if a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the trust s gold bars 
if any subcustodian which holds gold on a temporary basis does not exercise due care in the safekeeping of the trust s gold bars  the ability of the trustee or the custodian to recover damages against such subcustodian may be limited to only such recourse  if any  as may be available under applicable english law or  if the subcustodian is not located in england  under other applicable law 
this is because there are expected to be no written contractual arrangements between subcustodians who may hold the trust s gold bars and the trustee or the custodian  as the case may be 
if the trustee s or the custodian s recourse against the subcustodian is so limited  the trust may not be adequately compensated for the loss 
for more information on the trustee s and the custodian s ability to seek recovery against subcustodians and the subcustodian s duty to safekeep the trust s gold bars  see custody of the trust s gold 
gold held in the trust s unallocated gold account and any authorized participant s unallocated gold account will not be segregated from the custodian s assets 
if the custodian becomes insolvent  its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the trust or any authorized participant 
in addition  in the event of the custodian s insolvency  there may be a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold bars held in the trust s allocated gold account 
gold which is part of a deposit for a purchase order or part of a redemption distribution will be held for a time in the trust unallocated account and  previously or subsequently in  the authorized participant unallocated account of the purchasing or redeeming authorized participant 
during those times  the trust and the authorized participant  as the case may be  will have no proprietary rights to any specific bars of gold held by the custodian and will each be an unsecured creditor of the custodian with respect to the amount of gold held in such unallocated accounts 
in addition  if the custodian fails to allocate the trust s gold in a timely manner  in the proper amounts or otherwise in accordance with the terms of the unallocated bullion account agreement  or if a subcustodian fails to so segregate gold held by it on behalf of the trust  unallocated gold will not be segregated from the custodian s assets  and the trust will be an unsecured creditor of the custodian with respect to the amount so held in the event of the insolvency of the custodian 
in the event the custodian becomes insolvent  the custodian s assets might not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the trust or the authorized participant for the amount of gold held in their respective unallocated gold accounts 
in the event of the insolvency of the custodian  a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the gold held in all of the accounts held by the custodian  including the trust allocated account 
although the trust would retain legal title to the allocated gold bars  the trust could incur expenses in connection with obtaining control of the allocated gold bars  and the assertion of a claim by such liquidator for unpaid fees due to the custodian could delay creations and redemptions of baskets 

table of contents the gold bullion custody operations of the custodian are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision 
the custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the trust s gold bullion that the custodian allocates to the trust in connection with the creation of baskets by authorized participants 
the custodian also facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the trust through unallocated gold accounts it maintains for authorized participants and the trust 
although the custodian is a market maker  clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the lbma which sets out good practices for participants in the bullion market  the lbma is not an official or governmental regulatory body 
furthermore  although the custodian is subject to general banking regulations by us regulators and is generally regulated in the uk by the financial services authority  such regulations do not directly cover the custodian s gold bullion custody operations in the uk accordingly  the trust is dependent on the custodian to comply with the best practices of the lbma and to implement satisfactory internal controls for its gold bullion custody operations in order to keep the trust s gold secure 
in issuing baskets  the trustee relies on certain information received from the custodian which is subject to confirmation after the trustee has relied on the information 
if such information turns out to be incorrect  baskets may be issued in exchange for an amount of gold which is more or less than the amount of gold which is required to be deposited with the trust 
the custodian s definitive records are prepared after the close of its business day 
however  when issuing baskets  the trustee relies on information reporting the amount of gold credited to the trust s accounts which it receives from the custodian during the business day and which is subject to correction during the preparation of the custodian s definitive records after the close of business 
if the information relied upon by the trustee is incorrect  the amount of gold actually received by the trust may be more or less than the amount required to be deposited for the issuance of baskets 
the trust s obligation to reimburse the marketing agent and the authorized participants for certain liabilities in the event the sponsor fails to indemnify such parties could adversely affect an investment in the shares 
the sponsor has agreed to indemnify the marketing agent  its partners  directors and officers  and any person who controls the marketing agent  and its respective successors and assigns  against any loss  damage  expense  liability or claim that may be incurred by the marketing agent in connection with any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement of which this report forms a part including this report  any preliminary prospectus  any prospectus supplement and any exhibits thereto or any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading  any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact made by the sponsor with respect to any representations and warranties or any covenants under the marketing agent agreement  or failure of the sponsor to perform any agreement or covenant therein  any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any materials used in connection with the marketing of the shares  circumstances surrounding the third party allegations relating to patent and contract disputes  or the marketing agent s performance of its duties under the marketing agent agreement  and to contribute to payments that the marketing agent may be required to make in respect thereof 
the trustee has agreed to reimburse the marketing agent  solely from and to the extent of the trust s assets  for indemnification and contribution due under the preceding sentence to the extent the sponsor has not paid such amounts directly when due 
under the participant agreement  the sponsor also has agreed to indemnify the authorized participants against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the securities act and to contribute to payments that the authorized participants may be required to make in respect of such liabilities 
the trustee has agreed to reimburse the authorized participants  solely from and to the extent of the trust s assets  for indemnification and contribution amounts due from the sponsor in respect of such liabilities to the extent the sponsor has not paid such amounts when due 
in the event the trust is required to pay any such amounts  the trustee would be required to sell assets of the trust to cover the amount of any such payment and the nav of the trust would be reduced accordingly  thus adversely affecting an investment in the shares 

table of contents under the trust indenture  the sponsor may be able to seek indemnification from the trust for payments it makes in connection with the sponsor s activities under the trust indenture to the extent its conduct does not disqualify it from receiving such indemnification under the terms of the trust indenture 
the sponsor will also be indemnified from the trust and held harmless against any loss  liability or expense arising under the marketing agent agreement or any participant agreement insofar as such loss  liability or expense arises from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any written statement provided to the sponsor by the trustee

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trust overview the trust is an investment trust that was formed on november  date of inception 
the trust issues baskets of shares  or baskets  in exchange for deposits of gold and distributes gold in connection with the redemption of baskets 
the investment objective of the trust is for the shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion  less the expenses of the trust s operations 
the shares are designed to provide investors with a cost effective and convenient way to invest in gold 
investing in the shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks  including price volatility 
the following table illustrates the movement in the price of the shares and net asset value of the shares against the corresponding gold price per of an oz

gold price november  to september  logo the divergence of the price of the shares and net asset value of the shares from the gold price over time reflects the cumulative effect of the trust expenses that arise if an investment had been held since inception 
valuation of gold  definition of net asset value and adjusted net asset value at the valuation time  the trustee values the trust s gold on the basis of that day s london pm fix or  if no london pm fix is made on such day or has not been announced by the valuation time  the next most recent london gold price fix am or pm determined prior to the valuation time will be used  unless the trustee  in consultation with the sponsor  determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation 
in the event the trustee and the sponsor determine that the london pm fix or last prior london fix is not an appropriate basis for valuation of the trust s gold  they will identify an alternative basis for such valuation to be employed by the trustee 
once the value of the gold has been determined  the trustee subtracts all estimated accrued fees other than the fees to be computed by reference to the value of the anav of the trust or custody fees computed by reference to the value of gold held in the trust  expenses and other liabilities of the trust 
table of contents from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the trust other than any amounts credited to the trust s reserve account  if established 
the resulting figure is the anav of the trust 
the anav of the trust is used to compute the fees of the trustee  the sponsor and the marketing agent 
to determine the trust s nav  the trustee subtracts from the anav of the trust the amount of estimated accrued fees computed by reference to the value of the anav of the trust and computed by reference to the value of the gold held in the trust ie the fees of the trustee  the sponsor  the marketing agent and the custodian 
the trustee determines the nav per share by dividing the nav of the trust by the number of shares outstanding as of the close of trading on nyse arca

for accounting purposes the trust reflects creations and the gold receivable with respect to such creations on the date of receipt of a notification of a creation  but does not issue shares until the requisite amount of gold is received 
upon a redemption  the trust delivers gold upon receipt of shares 
all references in this discussion to gold receivable and gold payable relate to creations and redemptions that had not been completed 
these creations and redemptions were completed in the normal course of business  including the receipt and payment of the gold by the custodian 
as at september   the amount of gold owned by the trust was  ounces  with a market value of  cost  including gold payable of  ounces with a market value of  based on the london pm fix on september  in accordance with the trust indenture

cash flow from operations the trust had no net cash flow from operations in the years ended september   and cash received in respect of gold sold to pay expenses in the years ended september   and was the same as those expenses  resulting in a zero cash balance at september   and off balance sheet arrangements the trust is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements 
cash resources and liquidity at september  and the trust did not have any cash balances 
when selling gold to pay expenses  the trustee endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the trust s holdings of assets other than gold 
as a consequence  we expect that the trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period 
analysis of movements in the price of gold as movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the trust s shares  investors should understand what the recent movements in the price of gold have been 
investors  however  should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements
