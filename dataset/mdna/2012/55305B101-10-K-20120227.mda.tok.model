application of critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates and judgments and makes adjustments as deemed necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
listed below are those estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of a home is recognized when the closing has occurred  title has passed  the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer  and an adequate initial and continuing investment by the homebuyer is received  or when the loan has been sold to a third party investor 
revenue for homes that close to the buyer having a deposit of or greater  home closings financed by third parties  and all home closings insured under federal housing administration fha  us veterans administration va  and other government insured programs are recorded in the financial statements on the date of closing 
revenue related to all other home closings initially funded by our wholly owned subsidiary  m i financial corp 
m i financial  is recorded on the date that m i financial sells the loan to a third party investor  because the receivable from the third party investor is not subject to future subordination  and the company has transferred to this investor the usual risks and rewards of ownership that is in substance a sale and does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the home 
all associated homebuilding costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from home closings are recognized 
homebuilding costs include land and land development costs  home construction costs including an estimate of the costs to complete construction  previously capitalized interest  real estate taxes  indirect costs  and estimated warranty costs 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
sales incentives  including pricing discounts and financing costs paid by the company  are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives in the form of options or upgrades are recorded in homebuilding costs 
we recognize the majority of the revenue associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and or related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
the revenue recognized is reduced by the fair value of the related guarantee provided to the investor 
the fair value of the guarantee is recognized in revenue when the company is released from its obligation under the guarantee 
generally  all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors within two to three weeks of origination 
we recognize financial services revenue associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered  and title policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventory 
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual lots on a pro rata basis  and the costs of the lots are transferred to homes under construction when home construction begins 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs 
inventory is recorded at cost  unless events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the land may be impaired 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred and home construction costs  inventory includes capitalized interest  real estate taxes  and certain indirect costs incurred during land development and home construction 
such costs are charged to cost of sales simultaneously with revenue recognition  as discussed above 
when a home is closed  we typically have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
as homes close  we compare the home construction budget to actual recorded costs to date to estimate the additional costs to be incurred from our subcontractors related to the home 
we record a liability and a corresponding charge to cost of sales for the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to that home 
we monitor the accuracy of such estimates by comparing actual costs incurred in subsequent months to the estimate 
although actual costs to complete a home in the future could differ from our estimates  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
the company assesses inventory for recoverability on a quarterly basis if events or changes in local or national economic conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in conducting our quarterly review for indicators of impairment on a community level  we evaluate  among other things  margins on sales contracts in backlog  the margins on homes that have been delivered  expected changes in margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community  expected changes in margins with regard to future land sales  the value of the land itself as well as any results from third party appraisals 
from the review of all of these factors  we identify communities whose carrying values may exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows and run a test for recoverability 
for those communities whose carrying values exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows and which are deemed to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the communities exceeds the estimated fair value 
due to the fact that the company s cash flow models and estimates of fair values are based upon management estimates and assumptions  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead the company to incur additional impairment charges in the future 
for all of the categories listed below  the key assumptions relating to the valuations are dependent on project specific local market and or community conditions and are inherently uncertain 
because each inventory asset is unique  there are numerous inputs and assumptions used in our valuation techniques 
market factors that may impact these assumptions include historical project results such as average sales price and sales pace  if closings have occurred in the project  competitors market and or community presence and their competitive actions  project specific attributes such as location desirability and uniqueness of product offering  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  and current economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other market factors that may impact project assumptions are considered by personnel in our homebuilding divisions as they prepare or update the forecasts for each community 
quantitative and qualitative factors other than home sales prices could significantly impact the potential for future impairments 
the sales objectives can differ between communities  even within a given sub market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
furthermore  the key assumptions included in our estimated future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in home sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace or a reduction in base house costs 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated average selling price  construction and development costs  absorption pace  selling strategies  or discount rates  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
as of december   our projections generally assume a gradual improvement in market conditions over time 
if communities are not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the fair value of a community is estimated by discounting management s cash flow projections using an appropriate risk adjusted interest rate 
as of december   we utilized discount rates ranging from to in our valuations 
the discount rate used in determining each asset s estimated fair value reflects the inherent risks associated with the related estimated cash flow stream  as well as current risk free rates available in the market and estimated market risk premiums 
for example  construction in progress inventory  which is closer to completion  will generally require a lower discount rate than land under development in communities consisting of multiple phases spanning several years of development 
operating communities if an indicator for impairment exists for existing operating communities  the recoverability of assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales 
these estimated cash flows are developed based primarily on management s assumptions relating to the specific community 
the significant assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of assets include the timing of development and or marketing phases  projected sales price and sales pace of each existing or planned community  the estimated land development  home construction  and selling costs of the community  overall market supply and demand  the local market  and competitive conditions 
management reviews these assumptions on a quarterly basis 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
we believe the most critical assumptions in the company s cash flow models are projected absorption pace for home sales  sales prices  and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis 
in order to estimate the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in the company s cash flow models  the company analyzes the historical absorption pace in the community as well as other communities in the geographic area 
in addition  the company considers internal and external market studies and trends  which may include  but are not limited to  statistics on population demographics  unemployment rates  foreclosure sales  and availability of competing products in the geographic area where a community is located 
when analyzing the company s historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies  the company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters and management s most current assessment of sales pace 
in order to estimate the sales prices included in its cash flow models  the company considers the historical sales prices realized on homes it delivered in the community and other communities in the geographic area  as well as the sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities 
in addition  the company considers internal and external market studies and trends  which may include  but are not limited to  statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities  which include the impact of short sales  if any  and sales prices on similar products in non neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located 
when analyzing its historical sales prices and corresponding market studies  the company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the sales prices realized in its most recent quarters and the sales prices in current backlog 
based upon this analysis  the company sets a sales price for each house type in the community which it believes will achieve an acceptable gross margin and sales pace in the community 
this price becomes the price published to the sales force for use in its sales efforts 
the company then considers the average of these published sales prices when estimating the future sales prices in its cash flow models 
in order to arrive at the company s assumed costs to build and deliver homes  the company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors and subcontractors  adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure 
with respect to overhead included in the cash flow models  the company uses forecasted rates included in the company s annual budget adjusted for actual experience 
future communities 
if an indicator of impairment exists for raw land  land under development  or lots that management anticipates will be utilized for future homebuilding activities  the recoverability of assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets based on home sales  consistent with the evaluations performed for operating communities discussed above 
for raw land  land under development  or lots that management intends to market for sale to a third party  but that do not meet all of the criteria to be classified as land held for sale as discussed below  the estimated fair value of the assets is determined based on either the estimated net sales proceeds expected to be realized on the sale of the assets or the estimated fair value determined using cash flow valuation techniques 
if the company has not yet determined whether raw land  land under development  or lots will be utilized for future homebuilding activities or marketed for sale to a third party  the company assesses the recoverability of the inventory using a probability weighted approach 
land held for sale 
land held for sale includes land that meets all of the following six criteria management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated  the sale of the asset is probable  and transfer of the asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
the company records land held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions  market analysis and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  as well as actual contracts 
if the estimated fair value less the costs to sell an asset is less than the asset s current carrying value  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s best estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties in management s estimates and uncertainties related to our operations and our industry as a whole as further discussed in item a 
risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  we are unable to determine at this time if and to what extent continuing future impairments will occur 
investment in unconsolidated limited liability companies 
we invest in entities that acquire and develop land for distribution to us in connection with our homebuilding operations 
in our judgment  we have determined that these entities generally do not meet the criteria of variable interest entities vies because  amongst other things  they have sufficient equity to finance their operations 
we must use our judgment to determine if we have substantive control of these entities 
if we were to determine that we have substantive control  we would be required to consolidate the entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have substantive control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions  and continuing involvement 
in the event an entity does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations  we would be required to use judgment to determine if we were the primary beneficiary of the vie 
we consider our accounting policies with respect to determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have substantive control of the vie to be critical accounting policies due to the judgment required 
these entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the company evaluates its investment in unconsolidated limited liabilities companies unconsolidated llcs for potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the investment s carrying value and the company has determined that the decline in value is other than temporary  the company would write down the value of the investment to fair value 
the determination of whether an investment s fair value is less than the carrying value requires management to make certain assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future contributions to the unconsolidated llc  the timing of distribution of lots to the company from the unconsolidated llc  the projected fair value of the lots at the time of distribution to the company  and the estimated proceeds from  and timing of  the sale of land or lots to third parties 
in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs  the company evaluates the projected cash flows associated with each unconsolidated llc 
as of december   the company used a discount rate of in determining the fair value of investments in unconsolidated llcs 
in addition to the assumptions management must make to determine if the investment s fair value is less than the carrying value  management must also use judgment in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the factors management considers are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the company  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the unconsolidated llc for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
because of the high degree of judgment involved in developing these assumptions  it is possible that the company may determine the investment is not impaired in the current period but  due to passage of time or change in market conditions leading to changes in assumptions  impairment could occur 
guarantees and indemnities 
guarantee and indemnity liabilities are established by charging the applicable line item in our consolidated statements of operations or our consolidated balance sheets  depending on the nature of the guarantee or indemnity  and crediting a liability 
m i financial provides a limited life guarantee on loans sold to certain third parties and estimates its actual liability related to the guarantee and any indemnities subsequently provided to the purchaser of the loans in lieu of loan repurchase based on historical loss experience 
actual future costs associated with loans guaranteed or indemnified could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
the company has also provided certain other guarantees and indemnifications in connection with the purchase and development of land  including guarantees of the completion of land development 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the estimated cost of insurance coverage or estimated cost of acquiring a bond in the amount of the exposure 
actual future costs associated with these guarantees and indemnities could differ materially from our current estimated amounts 
warranty 
warranty accruals are established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty accrual for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor required under the company s warranty programs 
accruals are recorded for warranties under the following warranty programs home builder s limited warranty  and year transferable structural warranty the warranty accruals for the home builder s limited warranty are established as a percentage of average sales price  and the structural warranty accruals are established on a per unit basis 
our warranty accruals are based upon historical experience by geographic area and recent trends 
factors that are given consideration in determining the accruals include the historical range of amounts paid per average sales price on a home  type and mix of amenity packages added to the home  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  timing of payments  improvements in quality of construction expected to impact future warranty expenditures  actuarial estimates  which reflect both company and industry data  and conditions that may affect certain projects and require a different percentage of average sales price for those specific projects 
changes in estimates for warranties occur due to changes in the historical payment experience and differences between the actual payment pattern experienced during the period and the historical payment pattern used in our evaluation of the warranty accrual balance at the end of each quarter 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our current estimated amount 
self insurance 
self insurance accruals are made for estimated liabilities associated with employee health care  workers compensation  and general liability insurance 
for  our self insurance limit for employee health care was  per claim per year  with stop loss insurance covering amounts in excess of  our workers compensation claims are insured by a third party and carry a deductible of  per claim  with maximum incurred losses not to exceed  except for claims made in the state of ohio where the company is self insured 
our self insurance limit for ohio workers compensation is  per claim  with stop loss insurance covering all amounts in excess of this limit 
the accruals related to employee health care and workers compensation are based on historical experience and open case reserves 
our general liability claims are insured by a third party  the company generally has a million deductible per occurrence and a million deductible in the aggregate  with lower deductibles for certain types of claims 
the company records a general liability accrual for claims falling below the company s deductible 
the general liability accrual estimate is based on an actuarial evaluation of our past history of claims  other industry specific factors and specific event analysis 
the company recorded expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  for all self insured and general liability claims during the years ended december   and for the year ended december   this included million of charges related to defective drywall  as well as the million settlement received in the third quarter of related to defective drywall 
for the year ended december   this included million of charges related to defective drywall 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated accrual amounts  actual future costs could differ from our current estimated amounts 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding expenses relating to defective drywall 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation by recognizing compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based awards granted under compensation arrangements 
we calculate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of the awards 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
derivative financial instruments 
to meet financing needs of our home buying customers  m i financial is party to interest rate lock commitments irlcs  which are extended to customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
these irlcs are considered derivative financial instruments 
m i financial manages interest rate risk related to its irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss  the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  and the occasional purchase of options on fmbss in accordance with company policy 
these fmbss  options on fmbss  and irlcs covered by fmbss are considered non designated derivatives 
in determining the fair value of irlcs  m i financial considers the value of the resulting loan if sold in the secondary market 
the fair value includes the price that the loan is expected to be sold for along with the value of servicing release premiums 
subsequent to inception  m i financial estimates an updated fair value  which is compared to the initial fair value 
in addition  m i financial uses fallout estimates  which fluctuate based on the rate of the irlc in relation to current rates 
gains or losses are recorded in financial services revenue 
certain irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale are committed to third party investors through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments 
the irlcs and related best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  which generally are highly effective from an economic standpoint  are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value  with gains or losses recorded in financial services revenue 
under the terms of these best efforts whole loan delivery commitments covering mortgage loans held for sale  the specific committed mortgage loans held for sale are identified and matched to specific delivery commitments on a loan by loan basis 
the delivery commitments and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in financial services revenue 
income taxes valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recorded against a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under applicable tax law 
the four sources of taxable income to be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is required are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary requires an analysis of both positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include a strong earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the deductible temporary differences  coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is the result of an aberration rather than a continuing condition  an excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of a company s net assets in an amount sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset  and existing backlog that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures 
examples of negative evidence may include the existence of cumulative losses defined as a pre tax cumulative loss for the business cycle in our case four years  an expectation of being in a cumulative loss position in a future reporting period  a carryback or carryforward period that is so brief that it would limit the realization of tax benefits  a history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused  and unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets  including net operating losses  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
we evaluate this based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable  and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
the company s current and prior year losses present the most significant negative evidence as to whether the company needs to reduce its deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we are currently in excess of a four year cumulative pre tax loss position 
we currently believe the cumulative weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and  as a result  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets 
therefore  as of december   the company had a total valuation allowance of million recorded 
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
future adjustments to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be determined based upon changes in the expected realization of our net deferred tax assets 
excluding the carryback of million of certain expenses to  we do not expect to record any additional tax benefits in as the carryback has been exhausted 
additionally  our determination with respect to recording a valuation allowance may be further impacted by  among other things additional inventory impairments  additional pre tax operating losses  the utilization of tax planning strategies that could accelerate the realization of certain deferred tax assets  or changes in relevant tax law 
additionally  due to the considerable estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to either increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
income taxes tax positions 
the company evaluates tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in tax returns  and records the associated tax benefit or liability 
tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and penalties for all uncertain tax positions are recorded within benefit provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations the company s segment information is presented on the basis that the chief operating decision makers use in evaluating segment performance 
the company s chief operating decision makers evaluate the company s performance in various ways  including the results of our eleven individual homebuilding operating segments and the results of our financial services operations  the results of our three homebuilding regions  and our consolidated financial results 
we have determined our reportable segments as follows midwest homebuilding  southern homebuilding  mid atlantic homebuilding and financial services operations 
the homebuilding operating segments that are included within each reportable segment have similar operations and exhibit similar economic characteristics over the long term 
our homebuilding operations include the acquisition and development of land  the sale and construction of single family attached and detached homes  and the occasional sale of lots to third parties 
the homebuilding operating segments that comprise each of our reportable segments are as follows midwest southern mid atlantic columbus  ohio tampa  florida washington  dc cincinnati  ohio orlando  florida charlotte  north carolina indianapolis  indiana houston  texas raleigh  north carolina chicago  illinois san antonio  texas in april  we acquired the assets of a privately held homebuilder based in san antonio  texas 
our financial services operations include the origination and sale of mortgage loans and title services primarily for purchasers of the company s homes 
highlights and trends for the year ended december  overview throughout  we and the entire homebuilding industry continued to face challenging operating conditions 
uncertainty about the strength and future of the us economy in general  and the homebuilding industry in particular  has created very cautious consumer sentiment throughout the potential homebuyer population 
we believe that this consumer anxiety  coupled with tougher overall lending standards  kept many would be homebuyers on the sidelines for most of  and as a result  our new contracts did not increase as much as we and many others in our industry had hoped 
as a result  we experienced lower new contracts and deliveries in the first half of when compared to the first half of  the period in which the federal homebuyer tax credit was available and helping with sales volumes 
in order to stimulate our new contracts in the second half of  we lowered sales prices and or offered increased incentives in some of our communities 
these actions  while improving sales pace  resulted in lower gross margins  ultimately yielding higher impairment charges in compared to while homes delivered decreased and the average sales price of those homes delivered decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   we did experience an increase in new contracts of for the year  with a increase in the last six months of  when compared to the last six months of we are encouraged that we are starting with increases in both our backlog units and total backlog sales value of and  respectively  when compared to a year ago 
our adjusted operating gross margin see the table set forth below under key financial operating results which reconciles the non gaap financial measure of adjusted operating gross margin to its most directly comparable gaap financial measure  gross margin also improved sequentially in every quarter of  from in to in  as we experienced a positive shift in the mix of our home deliveries from our legacy communities to our new communities 
in  our new communities  on average  yielded more basis points in gross margin than our legacy communities 
while there have been recent signs of stability in certain markets and some housing reports have become more optimistic the last quarter of  it remains difficult to predict when and at what rate the negative conditions affecting the homebuilding industry will improve  or when the homebuilding industry will experience a sustained recovery  allowing for less choppiness and more predictability in quarter to quarter and annual financial and operating results 
with these conditions in mind  we continued  and will continue  to focus on the following primary strategic business objectives maintaining a strong balance sheet  emphasizing customer service  product design  and premier locations  improving affordability through design changes and other cost reduction efforts  strategically investing in new communities and or markets  and meaningful presence in our markets 
in particular  during the second quarter of  we expanded our geographic footprint by completing our acquisition of the assets of a privately held homebuilder based in san antonio  texas 
we believe san antonio is a dynamic  growing market 
in addition  as mentioned above  we invested in new communities that are contributing to our effort to restore our profitability when and as housing markets improve 
during  we opened new communities defined by us as those having opened after january  and closed communities 
during and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of land 
looking ahead  we believe these actions have helped position us  both operationally and financially  to be able to generate higher future revenues and return to profitability as housing markets improve over time 
given the present operating environment and our outlook  however  we provide no assurance that the positive annual trends and or sequential quarterly trends in our new contracts  homes delivered mix and adjusted operating gross margin results that we achieved during will continue in key financial operating results for the year ended december   total revenue decreased million  from million in to million in this decrease was attributable to a decrease in homes delivered  from  in to  in  as well as a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in our decline in homes delivered largely reflects our relatively low backlog level at the beginning of  reflecting the decline in new contracts we experienced in the latter half of following the april  expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit  along with lower sales in the first half of when compared to the first half of revenue in our financial services segment increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   despite a decrease in the number of loans originated  from  in to  in loss before income taxes increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the following factors the decrease in revenue described above  net of improved gross margins  a million increase in impairment charges  a million increase in interest expense resulting from the re financing of our senior notes with our senior notes in november of  and the lack of a settlement in comparable to the million settlement we recognized and received during related to defective drywall 
these factors were partially offset by million lower selling  general and administrative expenses and the absence in of an million loss on the early extinguishment of a portion of our senior notes that occurred in during  the company incurred charges totaling million related to the impairment of inventory and our investment in unconsolidated llcs and million of abandoned land transaction costs  compared to million of like charges in the million increase in these charges was due to increased impairment charges in some of our legacy and close out communities  management s decision to decrease sales prices in various communities within our midwest and southern regions to help improve sales pace and remain competitive  as well as increased sales incentives offered  and a change in management s development plans for certain legacy raw land

selling expenses decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a million reduction in variable selling expenses as a result of fewer closings  a million decrease in advertising expenses  and a decrease of million in expenses related to our model homes 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from to  primarily due to a decrease of million in miscellaneous expenses  a decrease of million in payroll related expenses  a million decrease in land related expenses  including abandoned land transaction costs  and a decrease of million in professional fees

new contracts for the year ended december  were  a increase from  new contracts during the year ended december  our cancellation rate decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  our homes in backlog increased  from units at december  to units at december  our mortgage company s capture rate in was  which was the same as s capture rate 
capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from period to period 
as a result of our net loss during the year ended december   we generated deferred tax assets of million and recorded a non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of deferred tax assets generated

adjusted operating gross margin and adjusted pre tax loss are non gaap financial measures 
management finds these measures to be useful in evaluating the company s performance because they disclose the financial results generated from homes the company actually delivered during the period  as the asset impairments and certain other write offs relate  in part  to inventory that was not delivered during the period 
they also assist the company s management in making strategic decisions regarding the company s future operations 
the company believes investors will also find these measures to be important and useful because they disclose financial measures that can be compared to a prior period without regard to the variability of asset impairments and certain other write offs and adjustments 
in addition  to the extent that the company s competitors provide similar information  disclosure of these measures helps readers of the company s financial statements compare the company s financial results to the results of its competitors with regard to the homes they deliver in the same period 
because these measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap  they may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of the company s competitors due to potential differences in methods of calculation and charges being excluded 
due to the significance of the gaap components excluded  such measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance measures prescribed by gaap

seasonality and variability in quarterly results typically  our homebuilding operations experience significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
in general  homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year 
we believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter  as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions 
our financial services operations also experience seasonality because loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations

for the year ended december   we had million of homebuilding revenue in our midwest region  a decrease of million from the million of homebuilding revenue we had in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in homes delivered  from  in to in  which was partially offset by a slight increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our decline in homes delivered largely reflects our relatively low backlog level at the beginning of  reflecting the decline in new contracts we experienced in the latter eight months of following the april  expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit 
our midwest region had an operating loss of million for the year ended december   compared to operating income of million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in impairment charges as well as the decrease in revenue described above  partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and higher adjusted operating gross margins 
for the year ended december   there were million of impairment charges in our midwest region  compared to million of impairment charges for the year ended december  as a result of the tough market conditions and corresponding decrease in new contracts during the first half of  we lowered sales prices and or offered increased sales incentives in some of our communities during the second half of these actions  which helped improve sales pace  resulted in lower gross margins  ultimately yielding higher impairment charges in when compared to in addition  a portion of the increase in impairment charges was due to management s changes in the ultimate development plans for some of our legacy raw land 
excluding these impairment charges  our adjusted operating gross margin percentage was for and for the increase in adjusted operating gross margin percentage was primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of homes delivered in our new communities  where we are experiencing gross margins that are basis points higher  on average  than in our legacy communities 
for the year ended december   of the homes delivered in our midwest region were in new communities  compared to of our homes delivered during during  we opened new communities in our midwest region compared to new communities in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  from million in to million in  due to a decrease in variable selling expenses  payroll related expenses  land related expenses  professional fees  advertising expenses  and expenses related to our model homes

southern region 
for the year ended december   homebuilding revenue in our southern region increased million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily the result of a increase in the number of homes delivered  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average sales price of homes delivered increased slightly from  in to  in the increase in homes delivered was largely the result of our entry into the san antonio market during the second quarter of as well as our operations in our houston market that commenced during the fourth quarter of despite the increase in revenue  our operating loss in our southern region increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in impairment charges  as well as an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  and the million settlement we received during related to defective drywall 
we had million of impairment charges in in our southern region  compared to million in as a result of the tough market conditions  we lowered sales prices and or offered increased sales incentives in some of our legacy and close out communities in various markets within our southern region 
these actions resulted in lower gross margins  ultimately yielding the million increase in impairment charges 
in addition  a portion of the increase in impairment charges was due to changes in our ultimate development plans for some of our legacy raw land 
excluding these impairment charges  as well the million settlement received related to defective drywall net of million of charges related to defective drywall for the year ended december   our adjusted operating gross margin percentages were and for the years ended december  and  respectively

homebuilding revenue in our mid atlantic region decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  which was partially offset by a slight increase in the number of homes delivered  from homes in to homes in the decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a decline in homes delivered in our washington dc market in when compared to which has a higher average selling price than our north carolina markets 
despite the decrease in revenue from  our operating income in our mid atlantic region for the year ended december  was million the same as this was due to million of lower impairment charges in than as well as million lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lower expense level was due primarily to lower variable selling expenses  community opening costs and lower architectural expenses for new product in  offset in part by higher payroll related expenses  when compared to for the year ended december   there were million of impairment charges in our mid atlantic region  compared to million of impairment charges for the year ended december  excluding these impairment charges  our adjusted operating gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  the decline in adjusted operating gross margin percentage was due to a change in product mix in from the homes delivered in  which was partially offset by a greater percentage of our homes delivered coming from new communities where  on average  we experience higher gross margins 
during the year ended december   we opened new communities in our mid atlantic region compared to new communities opened in the region during the year ended december  homes in backlog increased  from homes at december  to homes at december   primarily due to a increase in new contracts from in to in the average sales price of homes in backlog also increased  from  at december  to  at december   and the overall sales value of our homes in backlog in our mid atlantic region increased from million at december  to million at december  in our mid atlantic region  during the year ended december   our monthly absorption rate was per community  compared to per community in the year ended december  our absorption rate  along with many of our other year over year comparisons  was negatively impacted in by the april  expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit 
financial services 
for the year ended december   revenue from our mortgage and title operations increased million  from million during the year ended december  to million for  despite a decrease in the number of loan originations 
the primary reason for this was the increase in refinance business our financial services segment experienced in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we had an increase of million in operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was attributable to higher margins on the loans sold in compared to at december   m i financial provided financing services in all of our markets 
approximately of our homes delivered during that were financed were financed through m i financial  which was the same rate as in capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from quarter to quarter 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in payroll related expenses and a million decrease in selling expenses 
interest expense net 
interest expense for the company increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average borrowing rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   along with the increase in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in  due primarily to the issuance of the senior notes in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  midwest region

mid atlantic region 
in our mid atlantic region  homebuilding revenue increased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the average sales price of homes delivered  from  in to  in  along with the increase in homes delivered from in to in operating income for was million  a million improvement compared to s operating loss of million 
the million improvement was primarily due to the increase in revenue and the average sales price of homes delivered discussed above  reduced impairment charges and higher gross margins 
excluding impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  our adjusted operating gross margins were and for those same periods in our mid atlantic region 
the increase was due to the results of our company wide initiative to reduce hard costs  along with value engineering in our mid atlantic markets 
in we opened new communities in our mid atlantic region compared to four new communities in overall  we experienced higher gross margins in our new communities 
excluding deposit write offs and pre acquisition costs of million in and million in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due to an increase in advertising expenses  research and development expenses  and expenses related to our sales offices 
new contracts decreased  from in to in year end backlog decreased in units  from at december  to at december   and in total sales value  from million at december  to million at december   with an average sales price in backlog decreasing from  at december  to  at december  our monthly absorption rate in our mid atlantic region was per community  compared to in financial services

general and administrative expenses increased million  which was offset by the million increase in revenue discussed above 
loan originations decreased  from  in to  in at december   m i financial had mortgage operations in all of our markets except houston  where we commenced home construction in the fourth quarter of approximately of our homes delivered during that were financed were through m i financial  compared to in capture rate is influenced by financing availability and can fluctuate up or down from quarter to quarter 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  from million in to million in primarily due to a decrease of million professional fees and a decrease of million in advertising expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by a million in payroll related expenses 
interest 
interest expense for the company increased million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in our weighted average borrowings from million in to million in  along with a slight increase in our weighted average borrowing rate  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview of capital resources and liquidity during and  we continued to focus on the reduction of operating expenses and carefully managing our use of cash to operate our business 
we also made acquisitions of land assets that met our investment and marketing standards to replenish our land inventories and to facilitate future growth in the markets in which we operate 
in april  we acquired the assets of a privately held homebuilder based in san antonio  texas  and we believe this expansion of our geographic footprint will help improve our overall operations 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  with million of this amount comprised of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
at december  and  our ratio of net debt to net capital was and  respectively 
our ratio of net debt to net capital is calculated as total debt minus total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  divided by the sum of total debt minus total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash plus shareholders equity 
we believe that the ratio of net debt to net capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our operations and comparing us with other homebuilders 
our net loss income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net loss income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and noncash charges relating to depreciation  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory 
when we are expanding our operations  inventory levels  prepaids  and other assets increase  causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increases  but for cash flow purposes net income is offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease 
as a result of the new land purchases and land development over the past couple of years  we have used cash in operations as we add new communities and purchase land for future use 
we continue to operate in a challenging economic environment  and it will become even more difficult to generate positive cash flow from operations and our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity for our business operations may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond our control 
however  we believe that our balance of unrestricted cash  available borrowing options  and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital  planned capital spending  and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months  including the repayment of the million outstanding balance of the company s senior notes due april  the senior notes 
operating cash flow activities during  we used million of cash in our operating activities  compared to million in during  as is typical in the homebuilding industry  our primary uses of cash in operating our business were for land purchases  land development expenditures  the costs of home construction  interest expense  selling expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
the primary source of cash was revenues from home deliveries  along with revenues from our financial services operations 
with respect to changes in assets and liabilities  the primary use of cash from operations in was an increase in total inventory of million 
this compares with a million increase in total inventory in we also had a million decrease in other liabilities 
partially offsetting these decreases was an million increase in our accounts payable  along with a million decrease in cash held in escrow in compared to the decrease in cash used in operating activities in compared to was driven by a million increase in the net change of accounts payable  from a decrease of million in to an increase of million in  along with a million reduction in the net change in inventory from an increase of million in to an increase of million in  and a million decrease in cash held in escrow 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million decrease in the net change in other assets  from a decrease in other assets of million in to a decrease of million in other assets in  which was primarily the result of the million income tax refund we received in we spent million on land purchases and million on land development for total spending of million  compared to million of total spending on land purchases and land development during in the normal course of our business  in addition to our land purchases  we have continued to enter into land option agreements  taking into consideration current and projected market conditions  in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  we have provided deposits to land sellers totaling million as of december  as consideration for the right to purchase land and lots in the future  including the right to purchase million of land and lots during the years through based upon our business activity levels  liquidity  leverage  market conditions  and opportunities for land in our markets  we currently estimate that in  we will spend a greater amount on land purchases and land development than the million that we spent in however  land transactions are subject to a number of contingencies and thus the timing of specific purchases is difficult to project 
in addition  we will actively monitor market conditions and our ongoing pace of home deliveries  and we plan to adjust our land spending accordingly 
investing cash flow activities for the year ended december   we used million of cash in investing activities  compared to million in this decrease in cash used was primarily due to the million increase in restricted cash in compared to the million increase in restricted cash as of december  primarily consisted of million of cash the company had pledged as collateral in accordance with the company s secured letter of credit facilities 
restricted cash as of december  primarily consisted of million of cash the company had pledged as collateral in accordance with the company s secured letter of credit facilities and million of cash pledged as security to the lenders under the credit facility  as was required during periods when we did not meet either the required minimum interest coverage ratio or the minimum acfo ratio as such terms are defined in the credit agreement 
this interest coverage provision was amended as part of the amendment to the credit facility entered into by the company on january  the amendment 
as a result of the amendment  going forward  the company will be able to maintain either or a combination of million of cash pledged to the lenders or million of excess availability under the secured borrowing base as defined in the credit agreement if the interest coverage ratio and acfo ratio are both less than 
financing cash flow activities for the year ended december   our financing activities generated million of cash  compared to million in the cash generated during was primarily the result of million of net proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes  which was partially offset by funds used to repurchase million of our senior notes in the tender offer and to pay the related transaction costs  including an early repurchase premium 
we also incurred million of fees and costs associated with issuing the senior notes in november in  we had million of proceeds from bank borrowings within our financial services operations  compared to million in  as well as million of proceeds from stock options exercised 
the financing needs of our homebuilding and financial services operations depend on anticipated sales volume in the current year as well as future years  inventory levels and related turnover  forecasted land and lot purchases  debt maturity dates  and other company plans 
we fund these operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facilities  and  from time to time  issuances of new debt and or equity securities  as management deems necessary 
our senior notes mature in april and at that time we will be required to repay the aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
we expect to use available cash and or borrowings from our credit facility to repay the senior notes at their maturity date 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness  and may incur substantial indebtedness in the future  to fund our homebuilding and mortgage origination activities 
we routinely monitor current operational requirements  financial market conditions  and credit relationships 
we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term liquidity requirements 
we further believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of existing cash resources and our existing sources of credit 
however  we continue to evaluate the impact of market conditions on our liquidity and may determine that modifications are necessary to our cash management if market conditions continue to deteriorate and or the challenging economic conditions extend beyond our expectations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace our existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future

borrowings outstanding at december  had a weighted average interest rate of 
interest payments by period will be based upon the outstanding borrowings and the applicable interest rate s in effect 
the above amounts do not reflect interest 
b the company is party to two land purchase agreements in which the company has specific performance requirements 
the future amounts payable related to these two land purchase agreements is the number of lots the company is obligated to purchase at the lot price set forth in the agreement 
the time period in which these payments will be made is the company s best estimate at when these lots will be purchased 
c as of december   the company had obligations with certain subcontractors and suppliers of raw materials in the ordinary course of business to meet the commitment to deliver homes with an aggregate sales price of million 
based on our current housing gross margin  excluding the charge for impairment of inventory  less variable selling costs  less payments to date on homes in backlog  we estimate payments totaling approximately million to be made in relating to those homes 
d as of december   the company had options and contingent purchase agreements to acquire land and developed lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
purchase of properties is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the company and the sellers and therefore the timing of payments under these agreements is not determinable 
the company has no specific performance obligations with respect to these agreements 
e we are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
as of december   we had million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  including million of related accrued interest and million of related accrued penalties 
we are currently not under examination by any taxing jurisdiction 
the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination of tax years through off balance sheet arrangements our primary use of off balance sheet arrangements is for the purpose of securing the most desirable lots on which to build homes for our homebuyers in a manner that we believe reduces the overall risk to the company 
our off balance sheet arrangements relating to our homebuilding operations include unconsolidated llcs  land option agreements  guarantees and indemnifications associated with acquiring and developing land  and the issuance of letters of credit and completion bonds 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  our financial services operations issue guarantees and indemnities relating to the sale of loans to third parties 
unconsolidated limited liability companies 
in the ordinary course of business  the company periodically enters into arrangements with third parties to acquire land and develop lots 
these arrangements include the creation by the company of unconsolidated llcs  with the company s interest in these entities ranging from to 
these entities engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing in the form of a capital distribution or selling developed lots to the company and its partners in the entity 
these entities generally do not meet the criteria of vies  because the equity at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from the equity investors  however  we must evaluate each entity to determine whether it is or is not a vie 
if an entity was determined to be a vie  we would then evaluate whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
these evaluations are initially performed when each new entity is created and upon any events that require reconsideration of the entity 
we have determined that none of the unconsolidated llcs in which we have an interest are vies  and we also have determined that we do not have substantive control over any of these entities  therefore  our homebuilding unconsolidated llcs are recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company believes its maximum exposure related to any of these entities as of december  to be the amount invested of million 
land option agreements 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into land option agreements in order to secure land for the construction of homes in the future 
pursuant to these land option agreements  the company will provide a deposit to the seller as consideration for the right to purchase land at different times in the future  usually at predetermined prices 
because the entities holding the land under the option agreement often meet the criteria for vies  the company evaluates all land option agreements to determine if it is necessary to consolidate any of these entities 
the company currently believes that its maximum exposure as of december  related to these agreements is equal to the amount of the company s outstanding deposits  which totaled million  including prepaid acquisition costs of million  and letters of credit of million 
guarantees and indemnities 
in the ordinary course of business  m i financial enters into agreements that guarantee purchasers of its mortgage loans that m i financial will repurchase a loan if certain conditions occur 
the risks associated with these guarantees are offset by the value of the underlying assets  and the company accrues its best estimate of the probable loss on these loans 
additionally  the company has provided certain other guarantees and indemnities in connection with the acquisition and development of land by our homebuilding operations 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional details relating to our guarantees and indemnities 
letters of credit and completion bonds 
the company provides standby letters of credit and completion bonds for development work in progress  deposits on land and lot purchase agreements and miscellaneous deposits 
as of december   the company had outstanding million of completion bonds and standby letters of credit  some of which were issued to various local governmental entities  that expire at various times through december included in this total are million of performance bonds and million of performance letters of credit that serve as completion bonds for land development work in progress  million of financial letters of credit  and million of financial bonds 
the development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as houses are built and sold 
in locations where development has progressed  the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit 
interest rates and inflation our business is significantly affected by general economic conditions within the united states and  particularly  by the impact of interest rates and inflation 
higher interest rates may decrease our potential market by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to them 
the impact of increased rates can be offset  in part  by offering variable rate loans with lower interest rates 
in conjunction with our mortgage financing services  hedging methods are used to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations between the commitment date of the loan and the time the loan closes 
during the past few years  we have experienced some detrimental effects from inflation  particularly the inflation in the cost of land that occurred several years ago 
as a result of declines in market conditions in most of our markets  in certain communities we have been unable to recover the cost of these higher land prices  resulting in lower gross margins and significant charges being recorded in our operating results due to the impairment of inventory and investments in unconsolidated llcs  and other write offs relating to abandoned land transaction costs 
in recent years  we have not experienced a detrimental effect from inflation in relation to our home construction costs  and we have been successful in reducing certain of these costs with our subcontractors 
however  unanticipated construction costs or a change in market conditions may occur during the period between the date sales contracts are entered into with customers and the delivery date of the related homes  resulting in lower gross profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  consisting of the credit facility and the mif mortgage warehousing agreement  which permit borrowings of up to million  subject to availability constraints 
additionally  m i financial is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to certain home buying customers who have applied for a mortgage loan and meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs will have a duration of less than six months  however  in certain markets  the duration could extend to twelve months 
some irlcs are committed to a specific third party investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments matching the exact terms of the irlc loan 
uncommitted irlcs are considered derivative instruments and are fair value adjusted  with the resulting gain or loss recorded in current earnings 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbss are used to protect uncommitted irlc loans against the risk of changes in interest rates between the lock date and the funding date 
fmbss related to uncommitted irlcs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments and are recorded at fair value  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
mortgage loans held for sale mortgage loans held for sale consist primarily of single family residential loans collateralized by the underlying property 
during the intervening period between when a loan is closed and when it is sold to an investor  the interest rate risk is covered through the use of a best efforts contract or by fmbss 
the fmbss are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings
