extraordinary item in  the company recorded an extraordinary gain of million to eliminate the negative goodwill recorded in conjunction with the purchase of the business and certain assets of mikasa  inc critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and with the instructions to form k and article of regulation s x 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances and customer chargebacks  inventory mark down provisions  health insurance reserves  impairment of goodwill  tangible and intangible assets  stock option expense  accruals related to the company s tax positions and tax valuation allowances 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions and under different conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third party suppliers 
inventory also includes finished goods  work in process and raw materials related to the company s manufacture of sterling silver products 
inventory is priced using the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
the company estimates the selling price of its inventory on a product by product basis based on the current selling environment 
if the estimated selling price is lower than the inventory s cost  the company reduces the value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
accounts receivable the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the initial and on going creditworthiness of the company s customers 
the company also maintains an allowance for anticipated customer deductions 
the allowances for deductions are primarily based on contracts with customers 
however  in certain cases the company does not have a formal contract and  therefore  customer deductions are non contractual 
to evaluate the reasonableness of non contractual customer deductions  the company analyzes currently available information and historical trends of deductions 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers or general economic conditions were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or sell the company s products at reasonable sales prices  or the company s estimate of non contractual deductions varied from actual deductions  revisions to allowances would be required  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
historically  the company s allowances have been appropriate and have not resulted in material unexpected charges 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are subject to an annual impairment assessment 
long lived assets  including intangible assets deemed to have finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may have been impaired 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
when impairment indicators are present  the company compares the carrying value of the assets to the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the company considered indicators of impairment of its long lived assets and determined that no such indicators were present at december  revenue recognition the company sells products wholesale  to retailers and distributors  and retail  directly to the consumer through the company s retail direct operations 
wholesale sales and retail direct sales are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is primarily at the shipping point for wholesale sales and upon delivery to the customer for retail direct sales 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities 
allowances and accruals for various sales incentives and promotions  which include cooperative advertising  buydowns  volume rebates and discounts  are reflected as reductions in net sales 
employee stock options the company accounts for its stock options through measurement of compensation expense for all share based compensation granted to employees and non employee directors at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the related service period for awards expected to vest 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility of the company s common stock and the risk free interest rate 
changes in these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate of the company s stock options on the date of the option grant 
the company historically has not issued options which would be variable awards 
employee healthcare in  the company commenced self insuring certain portions of its health insurance plan 
the company maintains an estimated accrual for unpaid claims and claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to estimate ibnr  actual claims may vary significantly from estimated claims 
income taxes the company applies the required provisions for financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the company s financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken 
the valuation allowance is also calculated  established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents derivatives the company accounts for all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as hedges and have been designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes have no net impact on earnings to the extent the derivative is considered perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes  changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are i cash provided by operating activities and ii borrowings available under its revolving credit facility 
the company s primary uses of funds consist of working capital requirements  capital expenditures and payments of principal and interest on its debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at december   working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  and the current ratio was to at december  compared to to at december  borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to the acquisition of creative tops and the retirement of the notes 
the company believes that availability under the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations is sufficient to fund the company s operations for the next twelve months 
however  if circumstances were to adversely change  the company may seek alternative sources of liquidity including debt and equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that any such alternative sources would be available or sufficient 
the company closely monitors the creditworthiness of its customers 
based upon the evaluation of changes in customers creditworthiness  the company may modify credit limits and or terms of sale 
however  notwithstanding the company s efforts to monitor its customers financial condition  the company may be materially affected in the future 
in  wal mart stores  inc including sam s club and asda superstore accounted for of the company s net sales
