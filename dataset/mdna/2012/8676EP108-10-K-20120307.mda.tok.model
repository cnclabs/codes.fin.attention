sunopta bioprocess represented the former sunopta bioprocess segment 
canadian food distribution in june  we completed the sale of our canadian food distribution assets to unfi canada  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of united natural foods  inc  for cash consideration of  cdn 
the divestiture of the canadian food distribution assets was an important step in our strategy to focus on our core food manufacturing platform  further strengthening our balance sheet and positioning sunopta for the future

segment realignment and rationalization efforts in february  we announced that a process to streamline operations and organizational structure had been undertaken to streamline operations  drive efficiencies and better align product innovation and commercial activities 
during the first quarter of the operating segments within sunopta foods will be re aligned to better align with the markets and customers serviced  rather than by product groupings 
as a result  the former fruit group has been eliminated and a new consumer products group has been created to focus on non grains based consumer packaged goods 
the consumer products group will be comprised of the frozen foods and healthy snacks operations which were part of the former fruit group  and the food solutions operations which were formerly part of the international foods group

with this realignment  sunopta foods will now consist of four operating segments  grains and foods  ingredients  consumer products and international foods 
we intend to begin reporting segmented information based on these new operating segments for the quarter ending march  in hand with these efforts  we also announced the rationalization of a number of operations and functions which led to a reduction of our salaried workforce 
once fully implemented  and after approximately in severance charges  this rationalization is expected to reduce annual costs by approximately  before tax 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most important to our business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
consideration given to customers such as value incentives  rebates  early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale 
sunopta inc 
december  k accounts receivable our accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is our largest current asset 
our inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimated net realizable value except for certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory when provisions to record inventory at market are necessary 
in order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date  we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory 
these factors include the age of inventory  the amount of inventory held by type  future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory 
our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time  using available information  expected business plans and expected market conditions 
we perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in inventory reserve 
prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product net of provisions 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that we will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic or market conditions 
advances to growers are typically made at the start of the growing season 
we monitor our advances to growers by monitoring adherence to agreed upon terms as well as evaluating general economic and market conditions  and assessing the status of the crops being grown in order to determine if the collection of the advance is at risk 
intangible assets we evaluate amortizable intangible assets acquired through business combinations for impairment annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment  such as an adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  eg  the loss of a significant customer  current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  eg  the introduction of a competing product that results in a significant loss of market share  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an intangible asset will be disposed of before the end of it previously estimated useful life  eg  a plan to exit a product line or business in the near term 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
a discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value using estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply 
some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flows  and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
a change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  an intangible asset s expected useful life can increase estimation risk  as longer lived assets necessarily require longer term cash flow forecasts  which for some of our intangible assets can be in excess of years 
in connection with an impairment evaluation  we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it  as appropriate 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
sunopta inc 
december  k reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the first year or base year in the calculation of the discounted cash flow model is based on actual results in each component  adjusted for unusual and non recurring items 
future years cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth  and our planned business strategies in future periods that would impact actual cash flows reported in the base year 
examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility  a reduction of working capital at a specific location  and price increases or cost reductions within business units 
the revenue growth and planned business strategies for future periods incorporated into the discounted cash flow model reflect our long term view of the market 
the discount rate is based on a segment s targeted weighted average cost of capital  which is not necessarily the same as our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are also impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions which may impact future results and result in projections not being attained 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
there was no indication of goodwill impairment based on the testing done for the year ended december  in the year ended january   we recorded an impairment charge of  related to goodwill in our natural health reporting unit  which is part of the international foods group segment 
in the year ended december   opta minerals recorded an impairment charge of  to write down goodwill in certain of its mill and foundry and abrasive products reporting units  and we recorded a impairment charge related to goodwill in the fruit group 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the critical assumptions used in the fiscal and annual impairment tests 
purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
in addition  amortization periods are subjective based on expected useful lives and chosen rates 
we determine the useful lives of intangible assets based on a number of factors  such as legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit useful life  and the effects of obsolescence  anticipated demand  existence or absence of competition  and other economic factors on useful life 
note of the consolidated financial statements provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles 
accrued expenses and other assets we make estimates of future payments and receipts which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of taxes and estimates of amounts payable or receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  we must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  we use historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from our estimates 
income taxes we are liable for income taxes in the us  canada  and other jurisdictions where we operate 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences  investment and other tax credits  the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions  enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year  the benefit of cross jurisdictional financing structures  changes due to foreign exchange  changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets  and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations 
sunopta inc 
december  k in making an estimate of our income tax liability  we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet 
we also estimate the amount of valuations allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
we assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgments had been used  our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock based compensation we maintain a stock option plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
at each grant date  we are required to estimate a number of inputs  such as the estimated life of the option  future stock price volatility  and the forfeiture rate used in the black scholes option pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non employee directors 
the expected life and forfeiture rate of a stock option is based on historical exercise and forfeiture patterns 
future stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common shares over the expected life of the stock option 
once determined at the grant date  the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the inputs used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation granted in fiscal  and sunopta inc

the acquisitions of dahlgren  edner  and lorton s added incremental revenues of  the underlying base growth rate for the business was approximately after accounting for changes including movements in foreign exchange and commodity prices 
the increase in revenue was due primarily to the changes in sales volume and pricing described below in segmented operations information 
sunopta inc 
december  k gross profit decreased  or  for the year ended december  to  from  for the year ended january  as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended january   a decrease of 
within sunopta foods  gross profit was negatively impacted by decreased demand and unfavorable commodity prices in our sunflower operations  due mainly to competition in the international marketplace 
in addition  volume declines at our frozen foods operation  fiber and fruit ingredients operations  and natural health products operation all contributed to the decline in gross profit compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these negative impacts were a combination of higher volumes and improved efficiencies at our aseptic  healthy snacks  and international foods operations 
in addition  the acquisitions of dahlgren  edner and lorten s contributed incremental gross profit of  selling  general and administrative costs sg a including intangible asset amortization decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended january  the acquisitions of dahlgren  edner and lorton s added an incremental  of sg a  and the stronger canadian dollar and euro relatively to the us dollar led to a  increase in sg a on foreign denominated costs compared to the prior year 
excluding these impacts  sg a spending within our base business decreased  reflecting lower marketing costs in support of our branded natural health products  lower overall compensation costs due in part to headcount reductions made in at our frozen foods and natural health products operations  and reductions in stock based compensation  bonuses and professional fees 
offsetting these decreases were headcount increases in our international foods and healthy snacks operations in support of business growth 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a and intangible asset amortization costs were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended january  foreign exchange losses were for the year ended december  as compared to gains of  for the year ended january  the decrease was primarily due to unfavorable exchange rate movements for the canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar 
operating income for the year ended december  decreased by  to  compared to operating income of  for the year ended january  due to the factors noted above 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended january  further details on revenue  gross margins and operating income variances are provided below under segmented operations information 
other expense for the year ended december  of  reflected primarily a non cash long lived asset impairment charge recorded in our natural health products operation of  partially offset by gains recognized on the sales of our frozen foods assets located in mexico and a reduction in accrued contingent consideration relating to the acquisition of dahlgren 
other expense for the year ended january  of  included long lived asset impairment and severance charges of  and  respectively  primarily related to rationalization efforts at our frozen food and natural health products operations 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended january   a decrease 
borrowing costs were lower for the year ended december  due to lower debt levels outstanding on our real estate and machinery and equipment term loan facilities  a lower base interest rate on borrowed funds as compared to the prior year  and a reduction of non cash amortization of deferred financing fees  partially offset by higher borrowings on our other credit lines 
income tax provision for the year ended december  was  compared to a provision of  for the year ended january  the increase in income taxes was due to an increase in the valuation allowance against current year losses that may not be realized in the future  as compared to a decrease in the valuation allowance in the prior year due to the canadian food distribution asset sale and the disposition of sunopta bioprocess 
we also recognized the benefit of certain state and federal tax credits in the us  which reduced the income tax provision 
earnings from continuing operations decreased  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended january  basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the year ended january  earnings attributable to non controlling interest for the year ended december  were  compared to earnings of  for the year ended january  the increase is due to higher net earnings in our less than wholly owned subsidiaries

december  k gain on the sale of discontinued operations of represents the after tax gains realized on the disposal of our interest in csop 
gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes of  for the year ended january  represents the gains realized on the sale of the canadian food distribution business and the disposition of sunopta bioprocess 
on a consolidated basis  earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to  and  respectively  for the year ended january  sunopta inc 
december  k adjusted earnings from continuing operations during the year ended december   we recognized certain charges and gains against earnings that we do not believe are reflective of normal business operations 
as a result  we believe it is useful to eliminate these charges and gains to compute an adjusted earnings from continuing operations amount for the year ended december  which we believe is more reflective of normal business operations 
adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share for the year ended december  were 
following is a calculation of our adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share for the year ended december  per diluted share earnings attributable to sunopta inc loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes earnings from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc adjusted for write down of intangible and other long lived assets at purity life health products  net of taxes of  other severance  rationalization  de listing and acquisition related costs  net of taxes of costs to curtail and retrofit facilities at the ingredients group  as well as integration costs at lorton s  net of taxes of  write down of certain inventory and long lived assets at frozen foods operations  offset by gains on sale of mexican processing assets  net of taxes of costs to fill expeller pressed oil contracts at a loss due to dispute with colorado mills  net of taxes of reduction of fair value of contingent consideration liability for dahlgren and edner adjusted earnings from continuing operations during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash write down of intangible and other long lived assets at our purity life health products operation  as the cash flows expected to be generated from these assets did not support their carrying values see note of the consolidated financial statements 
also during  we incurred severance and rationalization costs as we reduced headcount at certain operations  costs related to de listing of products at a canadian retailer  and professional  legal and other costs related to our acquisition of lorton s and inland 
due to the loss of a significant customer and new product development efforts in our ingredients group  we incurred costs to curtail and retofit certain of our manufacturing facilities throughout in addition  we incurred business integration costs related to our acquisition of lorton s 
as part of our rationalization of the frozen foods operation  we recorded a non cash write down on certain inventories where the carrying value was less than net realizable value  and wrote off long lived assets that could not be recovered through future cash flows 
partially offsetting these rationalization charges at frozen foods was a gain realized on the sale of land  building and processing assets located in mexico 
we also incurred excessive raw material and crushing costs in order to fulfil expeller pressed oil contracts at negative gross margins 
non cash gains were recorded due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities owing to the former owners of dahlgren and edner  as pre determined targets to achieve the contingent consideration were not attained 
we believe that earnings from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted earnings from continuing operations  and that earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 
the table above reconciles earnings from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc to adjusted earnings from continuing operations and reconciles earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations  in each case for the year ended december  sunopta inc 
december  k adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these non gaap measures  which have been adjusted for the impact of the items listed in the table above  assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap

these expenses are allocated to the groups based on specific identification of allocable costs that represent a service provided to each division and a proportionate distribution of costs based on a weighting of factors such as revenue contribution and number of people employed within each division 
as a result of the sale of the canadian food distribution business and sunopta bioprocess  a portion of the corporate management fees previously charged to these groups was reallocated as an expense of the corporate services operating segment

cash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities include the payment of previously accrued bonuses in the second quarter of and payment for crop inventories received in the grains and foods group in the fourth quarter of cash used to fund inventories was due to carrying higher levels of commodity corn and soybeans in the grains and foods group  as well as certain commodities at the organic corporation  into the current crop season in order to improve gross margins by contracting less acres of more costly crops 
cash used for income tax instalments represents payments in tax jurisdictions that do not have loss carryforwards that can be applied against earnings generated 
the reduction in cash provided from customer deposits is due to contracting less acres for planting  resulting in lower deposits received from our growers to purchase commodities 
cash provided from prepaid expenses and other current assets represents primarily the change in realized positions on derivatives instruments in place to reduce risk on corn and soybean positions

see forward looking statements 
management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural and organic foods and natural health products has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic products was valued at billion in according to the organic monitor  a specialist research firm focusing on the organic industry  with historical growth rates between and depending on product line and country 
we believe long term trends for growth remain in place 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  we believe there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this growing market 
we believe that our vertically integrated seed to table business model built over the past years has positioned sunopta as a global leader in the natural and organic foods and natural health products markets 
for  we believe we will realize revenue and unit growth compared to  resulting from new product offerings  new and expanding customer relationships and incremental sales of nutritious portable 
we believe that consumers will continue to focus on health conscious natural  organic and specialty foods and natural health products as concerns over disease  obesity and well being are center of mind and we feel sunopta is well positioned to meet the needs of these growing markets 
we believe that our net earnings for will improve versus as a result of improved volumes  pricing and product mix  increased capacity  cost reduction and rationalization initiatives  many of which have now been implemented  fixed cost leverage  and the avoidance of certain asset impairment charges recorded in which are not expected to reoccur in our primary focus for remains the improvement of operating margins and returns on assets employed 
consistent with  as a direct result of continually changing world wide macroeconomic conditions  we have decided to take a cautious and responsible approach with regard to providing guidance  and in doing so  will not provide specific revenue and net earnings guidance for at this time 
sunopta inc 
december  k our overall objective of realizing profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of our vertically integrated seed to table strategy remains unchanged 
we continue to look for ways to exploit strategic synergies across sunopta foods  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of operations include our performance excellence through people programs  product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of this report 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative to continue our growth 
as at december   we had  in cash  of which may only be used within opta minerals 
we also had approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash and borrowings available 
our remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to finance capital spending estimated to be  to  debt service of  and payment of the current portion of long term liabilities of in addition  depending on the outcome of pending legal proceedings related to the colorado sun oil processors dispute  we may be required to fund a settlement payment to colorado mills during at december  we had accrued  for this contingency 
adjustments to the accrued amount may be made in future periods depending on the outcome of our appeal 
we believe additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  the issuance of shares or through a divestiture 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing or transactions would be available or  if so  on terms that are acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
contractual obligations the table a below sets out our contractual obligations with respect to long term debt  operating and capital leases including interest costs  commitments to purchase grains  commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts and long term liabilities  at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations grain purchase commitments other commitments operating leases interest on long term debt commodity and foreign exchange contracts long term liabilities interest rate swap a this table does not include certain contingent consideration related to acquisitions completed prior to december  that may become payable if predetermined profit targets are achieved 
the estimated fair values of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions completed after january  are reflected in the table above

sunopta inc 
december  k item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial numbers presented in this item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are expressed in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  we may invest in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have its fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of our fixed rate term debt was january  and  january   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of  january   at an interest rate of january  is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at varying factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the company s ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates on variable rate term debt the company s after tax earnings would decrease increase by approximately january  in  opta minerals entered into an interest rate swap contract to exchange a notional amount of cdn  us  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of from august to august the fair value of the hedging derivative is estimated based on the standard swap valuation methodology 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of january  loss of 
the incremental gain in fair value of  net of income taxes of  has been recorded in other comprehensive loss for the period 
in february  opta minerals entered into a cdn  us  interest rate swap commencing in august  the date of expiry of the existing contract 
on the same day  opta minerals also entered into a cdn  us  interest rate swap 
the combined interest rate swap will expire in february foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the us dollar is also our reporting currency 
the functional currency of all operations located in canada is the canadian dollar  except for opta minerals  which uses the us dollar as its functional currency 
the functional currency of all operations located in europe is the euro 
for these operations  all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
for the corporate office  transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of sunopta and its canadian and european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
the canadian dollar depreciated relative to the us dollar in  with closing rates moving from cdn at january  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
the euro depreciated against the us dollar during  with closing rates moving from at january  to at december  as a result of the depreciation of the canadian dollar  as well as non cash write offs of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment at a canadian subsidiary  we had a decrease of  january  a decrease of  in net canadian assets in the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar during was more than offset by growth in our european subsidiary  resulting in a net increase of  january  increase of in net euro 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favor of against the canadian dollar or euro with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of our net assets by  january   for a canadian dollar exchange movement and  january   for a euro exchange movement 
sunopta inc 
december  k sunopta foods operations based in the us have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
the canadian based subsidiaries have significant transaction exposure as their sales are predominantly in canadian dollars while a substantial portion of their purchases are in us dollars 
the european operations are also exposed to various currencies as they purchase product from a wide variety of countries in several currencies and primarily sell into the european market 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
open forward foreign exchange contracts were marked to market at december   resulting in a loss of january  gain of  which is included in foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we began taking a more active role in an attempt to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the contracts entered into are primarily canadian dollars and us dollars as well as us dollars and euros 
the net effect of all exchange based transactions including realized foreign exchange contracts  unrealized open contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions including the translation gains and losses related to our corporate net monetary assets are recorded in foreign exchange on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of january  a gain of 
commodity risk sunopta foods enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain and certain other commodity transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved growers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  the company owned  january   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of january  and  january   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of january  
at december   the company has a net long position on soybeans of january   and a net long position on corn of  january  long position of  bushels 
an increase decrease in commodity prices of either soy or corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by january  
in addition  the international foods group hedges the purchase of cocoa to minimize price fluctuations 
other than noted above  there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta foods segments  opta minerals or related to corporate office activities
