jcg s industrial division  with a client base comprised primarily of private industrial companies  provides all phases of civil and structural construction  mechanical equipment erection  process pipe installation and boiler  furnace and heater installation and repair 

table of contents on november   the company entered into the rockford agreement to acquire privately held rockford 
upon completion of the acquisition on november   rockford became a wholly owned subsidiary 
based in hillsboro portland  oregon  rockford specializes in large diameter natural gas and liquid pipeline projects and related facilities construction 
rockford s business adds to the company s major underground project bidding and performance capabilities on a nationwide basis 
rockford also adds to our california underground capacity and provides a northwest united states location to expand the company s geographic presence 
the company segregates the business into three operating segments the east construction services segment  the west construction services segment and the engineering segment 
range of services east and west construction services both the east construction services and the west construction services segments specialize in a range of services that include designing  building installing  replacing  repairing rehabilitating and providing management services for construction related projects 
our services include providing installation of underground pipeline  cable and conduits for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation and maintenance of industrial facilities for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation of complex commercial and industrial cast in place structures  and providing construction of highways and industrial and environmental construction 
east construction services the east construction services segment incorporates the jcg construction business  located primarily in the southeastern united states 
the segment also includes the businesses located in the gulf coast region of the united states that were formerly included in the construction services segment  including cardinal contractors  inc west construction services the west construction services segment includes the construction services performed in the western united states  primarily in the state of california 
entities included in west construction services are arb inc  arb structures  inc 
and stellaris  llc and effective november   the results of the acquisition of rockford 
engineering the engineering segment includes the results of onquest  inc and born heaters canada  ulc 
the engineering group specializes in designing  supplying  and installing high performance furnaces  heaters  burner management systems  and related combustion and process technologies for clients in the oil refining  petrochemical  and power generation industries 
it furnishes turnkey project management with technical expertise and the ability to deliver custom engineering solutions worldwide 
material trends and uncertainties we generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects 
the award of these contracts is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
business in the construction industry is cyclical 
we depend in part on spending by companies in the energy  and oil and gas industries  as well as on municipal water and wastewater customers 
over the past several years  each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities  local highway and bridge needs and from the strength of the oil and gas industry  however  each of these industries and the government agencies periodically are adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions 
economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts in any particular period 

table of contents we and our customers are operating in a challenging business environment in light of the economic downturn and weak capital markets 
we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions may have on them 
we have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years  which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions  and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near term 
however  we believe that most of our customers  some of whom are regulated utilities  remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in the long term without substantial constraints 
seasonality and cyclicality our results of operations can be subject to quarterly variations 
some of the variation is the result of weather  particularly rain  which can impact primoris ability to perform construction services 
since the majority of the company s work is in the southern half of the united states  these seasonal impacts are not as dramatic for the company as may be experienced by companies in some other states 
in addition  demand for new projects can be lower during the early part of the year due to clients internal budget cycles 
as a result  the company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters 
the company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal  but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions 
because of the cyclical nature of its business  the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods  and the company s financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 
results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the united states 
project schedules  in particular in connection with larger  longer term projects  can also create fluctuations in the services provided  which may adversely affect us in a given period 
the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period  regional  national and global economic and market conditions  timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs  interest rate fluctuations and other factors may also materially affect our periodic results 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period

segment results the following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our three operating segments 
east construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the east construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue east construction services revenue gross profit and east construction services segment revenue in increased by million  or from the revenue increases occurred primarily in the jcg heavy civil group where revenue increased by million from continued work on large highway construction projects for state agencies in louisiana and texas compared to this increase was offset by a reduction of million in the jcg industrial group attributable to temporary slowdowns in construction activity within the petrochemical sector along the gulf coast 
gross profit increased by million or in compared to the increase resulted from increased gross profit contributed by the jcg heavy civil group of million primarily resulting from improved efficiency on a large causeway project in south louisiana 
and east construction services segment revenue increased in by million compared to  as a result of the december acquisition of jcg  which contributed revenues of million 
excluding the impact of the jcg acquisition  revenue for the segment was lower than the prior year by million caused primarily by a reduction in revenues on florida water and wastewater projects 
gross profit increased by million in compared to the increase resulted from increased gross profit contributed by the december acquisition of jcg of million in compared to this increase was partially offset by decreases in gross profit of million  primarily in water and wastewater projects 
the jcg gross profit amount included intangible amortization expense of million 

table of contents west construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the west construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue west construction services revenue gross profit and west construction services segment revenues increased by million  or for compared to primarily due to the million revenue increase contributed by the november rockford acquisition 
additionally  revenues increased in by million from california pipeline projects  million from cable and conduit projects  and million from industrial power plant projects 
gross profit for the west construction services increased by million  or  for compared to rockford contributed increased gross profit of million  pipeline projects increased by million  cable and conduit work increased by million and parking structures increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by a decreasing profit in the california industrial group of million 
in the initial phases of major construction projects  gross margins tend to be lower since we recognize a contingency in each phase of the project 
in the second quarter of  we determined that because of delays associated with the engineering of a power plant construction project  we would increase contingency amounts  thereby  reducing the margins and margin percentage for the project 
the issues were not fully resolved at the end of and the margin for the segment and the gross profit percentage were adversely affected 
gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to in compared to in primarily as a result of increased master service agreements msas and cost plus work  primarily remediation projects in california which reflect less risk  but with a lower profit contribution 
additionally  decreased margins in were impacted by the completion of higher margin projects during and west construction services segment revenues increased by million  or for compared to as a result of revenue of million contributed by the rockford acquisition in the fourth quarter of and a revenue increase of million from california water and sewer pipeline projects  partially offset by a decline in revenues from oil and gas pipeline projects of million and parking structure projects of million 
gross profit for the west construction services decreased by million  or  for compared to rockford contributed gross profit of million 
this amount was offset by an million decrease in other construction work  including decreases of million on oil and gas pipeline projects  million in underground cable and conduit projects  million on water and sewer projects in california and million in horizontal directional drilling projects 
these reductions were a result of the general slowdown in business primarily in california 
gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to in compared to in primarily as a result of lower utilization of equipment and manpower  especially in the first half of engineering segment revenue and gross profit for the engineering segment for the years ended december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue engineering segment revenue gross profit 
table of contents and engineering segment revenue in decreased by million  or  compared to  due to a lower international order activity in our canadian operation 
gross profit for the engineering segment for decreased to million from million for the same period in  a decrease of million  primarily due to the lower revenue volume  with gross profit as a percent of revenues slightly lower than in at 
and revenue for the engineering segment increased by million  or  for  compared to  due to several new projects that began in the first half of  replacing completed projects in gross profit for the engineering segment for increased to million from million for the same period in  an increase of million 
gross margin as a percent of revenues for was compared to for the same period in a significant portion of the increase was due to improvements in the final costs of several complex projects completed in compared to the estimated costs for these projects identified in the prior year 
these improvements resulted in a favorable impact to gross profit of million for excluding the impact of these projects  gross profit for was million  a net increase of million compared to the same period in the prior year  with gross profit as a percent of revenues of in compared to for selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  for compared to the total was the result of an million increase in the west construction services segment  an increase of million in the east construction services segment  an increase of million in the engineering segment  and an increase of million in primoris corporate expenses 
the total change consists of the following elements sg a expenses of the november acquisition of rockford resulting in an increase of million increased sg a expenses due from the acquisition of all day electric of million in november  rockford withdrew from the central states pension plan and recognized a non routine charge of million for the withdrawal liability in  we accounted for gain on sales of equipment in cost of revenues  while in we recorded this in sg a  resulting in an impact of million an increase of million  which includes an increase of approximately million in compensation and compensation related expenses 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for  and decreased to for from for this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increase in revenues over the two years  which allowed better absorption of the relatively fixed expenses and certain one time expenses 
merger related stock expense as part of the merger of rhapsody and former primoris in july  we issued shares of common stock to two foreign managers during and we recognized million of non cash expenses and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital for million in for  shares issued to the foreign managers in accordance with primoris attaining its financial performance targets 

table of contents other income and expense non operating income and expense items for the years ended december   and were as follows thousands thousands thousands other income expense income from non consolidated investments foreign exchange gain loss other income expense interest income interest expense total other income expense the income from non consolidated joint ventures for included a profit of million from the st 
bernard levee partners joint venture and a profit of million from the ompp joint venture 
these earnings were offset by losses of million for the wespac energy joint venture  including the impact for the non reimbursed project costs for the termination of development projects and reserves for assets not recoverable and an adjustment of million to recognize an other than temporary decrease in the value of the company s basis difference between the company s original investment and its pro rata share of the wespac equity 
income from non consolidated joint ventures for included million from the st 
bernard levee partners joint venture  offset by the write off of million for the all day electric joint venture and a million expense for the wespac energy joint venture  a developer of pipeline and terminal projects in which the company acquired a interest in july the company acquired a membership interest in the wespac energy joint venture in july for cash of million equity income loss from non consolidated investments for consisted of million income from the otay mesa power partners ompp joint venture  a power plant construction project near san diego  california  which was in the final stages of completion at the end of  and minor income of our other investments in joint ventures 
foreign exchange gain for  and reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar 
our contracts in calgary  canada are sold based on united states dollars  but a portion of the work is paid for with canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference 
other expense of million in and million in represents the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent earnout liabilities for rockford in and and jcg in during  jcg met the financial target and the remaining adjustment to the fair value of the liability at the time of meeting the target in september was expensed to sg a 
rockford met both the and the earn out targets and the adjustment to the fair value of the liability at the time of meeting the target was expensed to sg a in the applicable year 
interest income decreased in compared to both and as a result of declining interest rates and our decision to invest our excess cash balances primarily in certificate of deposits cd s purchased through the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service and in short term us treasury bills with various financials institutions that are backed by the federal government fdic program 
the decrease was partially offset by higher average cash balances in the period 
interest expense in decreased by million compared to and increased by million for compared to the million decrease in was due to lower levels of subordinated debt and decreases in interest rates on equipment debt due to re financing 
the million increase in was due to an increase of million for interest paid on the subordinated debt from the jcg and rockford acquisitions  an increase of million as a result of increased financing of equipment that were part of the jcg and rockford acquisitions  and million in interest on federal income taxes 
the weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at december   and was  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes our provision for income tax increased million to million for compared to as a result of increased profits  including the increased contribution from the november acquisition of rockford 
the tax rate decreased slightly for to compared to for the tax rate increased over the rate of as a result of reflecting a full year of results for our mix of revenues and profits in the various tax jurisdictions throughout the usa and canada as a result of the jcg acquisition in december we recorded a tax charge of million in in order to adjust the prior year accrual to the actual tax returns filed and recorded a one time tax charge of million for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents discontinued operations during december of  the company discontinued all operations in ecuador and a plan was put in place to sell the stock ownership of the ecuador company 
the results of operations and cash flows for the operation were reflected as discontinued operations in previously  the ecuador operations were included in the company s west construction services segment 
in february  the company entered into an agreement for the sale of the ecuador business 
the company agreed to pay million of remaining liabilities of the business  and the buyer agreed to acquire the business for million  which was comprised of million in primoris stock owned by the buyer and an interest free million note payable  due on february  subsequently  the due date of the note was extended until july  the note is secured by the buyer s pledge of  shares of primoris common stock 
the buyer also agreed to provide an indemnification to the company for any remaining liabilities 
the sale was completed in march the million in primoris common stock was cancelled when received by the company during the second quarter the sale of the ecuador business had no material impact to the company 
at both december  and  the balance sheet reflected a net liability of million for potential remaining liabilities under this agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available  is dependent on future events  or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
often  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting  the allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts carry certain inherent risks  including underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts  which may result in uneven and irregular results 
unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract 
to the extent that original cost estimates are modified  estimated costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  cash flow  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and material  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method for all of the types of contracts described in the paragraph above 
under the percentage of completion method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price change associated with such scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than costs related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in asc topic income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of our management  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available evidence  including recent financial operations  projected future taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the length of tax asset carryforward periods 
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions 
if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of these assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination  using the presumption the tax authority has fully knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax position not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur 
in performing these assessments  management relies on various factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable transactions and other market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated 
we account for goodwill  including evaluation of any goodwill impairment using the two step impairment test  under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other 
under this guidance  the company tests for goodwill impairment on october each year 
first  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgets discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows 
other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
in december  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill or impairment asu 
asu provides an option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that the fair value is not less than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
the company will adopt this standard effective january   and it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents disruptions to our business  such as end market conditions  protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future 
long lived assets assets held and used by the company  primarily property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use  we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
the calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
reserve for uninsured risks estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks 
significant judgments by us and where possible  third party experts are needed in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change 
we self insure worker s compensation claims up to  per claim 
we maintained a self insurance reserve totaling approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred 
our accruals are based on judgment  the probability of losses  and where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel 
the amount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheets 
actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due  fund business operations and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and our net cash flow 
in addition to cash flow from operations  we have availability under our lines of credit to augment liquidity needs 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity  we evaluate our working capital requirements on a regular basis 
we may elect to raise additional capital by issuing common stock  convertible notes  term debt or increasing our credit facility as necessary to fund our operations or to fund the acquisition of new businesses

backlog in the industries in which we operate  backlog can be considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
different companies in our industry define backlog differently 
we consider backlog as the anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts 
we calculate backlog differently for different types of contracts 
for our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts  we include the full remaining portion of the contract in our calculation 
since their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to determine  we do not include time and equipment  time and materials and cost plus contracts in the calculation of backlog 
our contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs  but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog
