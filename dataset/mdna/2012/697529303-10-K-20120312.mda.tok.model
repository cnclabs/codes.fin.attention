the following table provides the professional product segment s product and service revenue data by geographical region for the years ended december    and year ended december  north america europe middle east asia pacific rim south and central america australia japan total all consumer product segment revenues are currently derived solely from sales in the united states 
although was another challenging year  we were able to maintain a strong balance sheet 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities and other investments 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities and other investments 
our stockholders equity increased year over year  mainly driven by our million net income 
our current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities is x  down from x at the end of at december   we had no borrowings 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  available for sale and marketable securities valuation  accounts receivable valuation  inventory valuation  warranty provision  stock based compensation  fair value measurements  income tax valuation  and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec guidance on revenue recognition 
the sec s guidance requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the revenue from the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any estimated return and applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
in our consumer products business  customer returns are recorded on an actual basis throughout the year and also include an estimate at the end of each reporting period for future customer returns related to sales recorded prior to the end of the period 
we generally estimate customer returns based upon the time lag that historically occurs between the date of the sale and the date of the return  while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as a new consumer product introduction 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such return amounts are reasonable 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with accounting standards update no 
 multiple delivery revenue arrangements asu  we defer the estimated selling price ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with asu  based on the estimated selling price of each element 
in accordance with asu  we use vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe  if available  to determine the selling price of each element 
if vsoe is not available  we use third party evidence  or tpe to determine the selling price 
if tpe is not available  we use our best estimate to develop the estimated selling price 
we generally recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not determinable at the end of each quarter 
licensees are obligated to make payments to us between and days after the end of each quarter 
if at the end of a quarter royalty revenue from licensees are determinable  we record royalty revenue during the period earned 
periodically  as we sign on new licensees  we recognize back owed royalties in the period in which it is determinable and earned 
we have the right under our license agreements to engage independent auditors to review the royalty calculations 
the amounts owed as a result of these audits may be higher or lower than previously recognized 
we have other revenues which consist of quarterly technology transfer payments ttp quarterly payment as defined in the license agreement with proctor gamble 
ttp quarterly payments are being made by p g during the term of the license agreement up to and including the quarter in which p g launches the first licensed product as defined in the license agreement 
thereafter  ttp and royalty payments will be based on product sales as set forth in the license agreement 
ttps  including the ttp quarterly payments  are non creditable and non refundable and there is no right of offset 
on december   we announced an amendment to the license agreement with p g and gillette 
the amendment provides additional funding from each company to meet the common goal of a successful product launch 
the amendment does not change the scope of p g s non exclusive license to palomar s broad patent portfolio as well as its non exclusive license to the extensive technology developed by palomar prior to february  for home use  light based hair removal devices for women 
under the amended license agreement  the parties agreed to reduce pre commercial launch calendar quarterly payments from million to million for the calendar quarter ending december  and thereafter to million per year for an agreed period  after which the payments return to million per calendar quarter if no product has been launched 
p g will apply the savings  together with agreed minimum overall program funding  to accelerating product readiness and commercialization while palomar will be paid an increased percentage of sales after commercial launch 
the payments under the amended license agreement are being recognized ratably through the expected launch term 
in the past  we have had funded product development revenue from development agreements with johnson johnson and p g gillette 
for both johnson johnson and gillette  we have received payments in accordance with the work plans that were developed with each of johnson johnson and gillette 
revenue was recognized under the contracts as costs were incurred and services were rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered were recorded as deferred revenue 
payments were not refundable if the development was not successful 
marketable securities and other investments 
marketable securities  which primarily consist of auction rate preferred securities and auction rate municipal securities are classified as marketable securities under debt and equity securities topic of the fasb accounting standards codification and are recorded at fair market value 
any unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  would be computed on the basis of specific identification and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we evaluate unrealized losses to determine if the loss is other than temporary 
if the loss is other than temporary  it is separated into two amounts  one amount representing a credit loss and the other representing an impairment due to all other factors 
the amount representing a credit loss is recorded in earnings  while the remaining impairment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as we do not have the intent to sell the impaired investments  nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before the recovery of their cost basis 
we determined that the fair value of our auction rate securities ars was temporarily impaired as of december  and in addition to the auction rate preferred securities and auction rate municipal securities discussed above  our other investments primarily consisted of corporate bonds  us agency bonds  and us treasuries and were classified as held to maturity securities 
these other investments are recorded at amortized cost 
the amortized cost of these investments approximates fair market value 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectability 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide an additional reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs  and defaults 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detailed review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer a one year warranty for our base professional and consumer products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with fasb codification topic regarding stock compensation 
this guidance requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units  and stock settled stock appreciation rights sars to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and sar grants 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options and sars include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock over the option or sar s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option or sar s expected term and our expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our common stock  the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or sars granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  and the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or sar 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and currently have no intention to pay cash dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our income from operations  net income  and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our stock option and sar grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options and sars  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
fair value measurements 
the performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell or transfer such an asset or liability 
selection of the appropriate valuation technique  as well as determination of assumptions  risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment 
although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable  a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities and could have an impact on both our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
to value our auction rate securities  we determined the present value of the auction rate securities at the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on a fair value rate of interest and an expected time horizon to liquidity 
as the secondary market for these investments is not currently very active or liquid  their valuation required management s judgment 
income taxes 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic regarding income taxes  we can only recognize a deferred tax asset for future benefit of our tax loss  temporary differences and tax credit carry forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
since  we incurred operating losses in foreign jurisdictions 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the associated tax asset will not be utilized 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance in and on this deferred tax asset 
in and  we recorded a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover these deferred tax assets  we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
as a result of the resolution of the patent infringement lawsuits against syneron  inc  syneron medical ltd  and candela corporation  we generated profits in the us in which were partially offset by us net operating loss carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we looked to our historic losses and our future profitability 
we do not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets totaling approximately million  related to excess tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options 
recognition of these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity 
for   and  the impact to paid in capital resulting from the exercise and expiration of employee stock options was million  million  and million  respectively 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
contingencies 
the medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven 
as a result  intellectual property rights  particularly patents  play a significant role in product development and differentiation 
however  intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable 
furthermore  appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions 
in addition  competing parties may file suits to balance risk and exposure between the parties 
adverse outcomes in proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions  or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought  remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal 
accordingly  the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time  predict or quantify 
we are not insured with respect to intellectual property infringement and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and product liability claims 
the absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
we continually assess litigation to determine if an unfavorable outcome would lead to a probable loss or reasonably possible loss which could be estimated 
in accordance with the fasb s guidance on accounting for contingencies  we accrue for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
in the cases where we believe that a reasonably possible loss exists  we disclose the facts and circumstances of the litigation  including an estimable range  if possible 
in management s opinion  we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings which  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
losses associated with any of our current litigation as discussed in detail in item legal proceedings were remote at the time of the filing and as such  we have not recorded any material loss contingencies related to such litigation 
we expense patent defense costs  costs for pursuing patent infringements  and external legal costs related to intangible assets in the period which they are incurred

throughout  the aesthetic laser industry and our professional product revenues continued to be negatively affected by the downturn in the global economy 
in both and  professional sales of our starlux laser and pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces remained the leading contributor to our product revenues 
we launched the acleara acne clearing system during the first half of and the icon aesthetic system during the second half of more than of our professional product revenues in the fourth quarter were from icon sales 
we are still in the registration process for many countries and will continue to sell the starlux system 
in  we launched the artisan platform  a complete facial rejuvenation system 
shipments began in the second quarter of in  as compared to  professional product revenues were favorably impacted by the introduction of the icon and acleara  but this impact was partially offset by a decrease in sales related to the starlux laser and pulsed light system as some potential starlux customers opted to purchase the new icon 
consumer product revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched the palovia skin renewing laser our first consumer product 
since we were selling the palovia laser through retail channels with which we had no history and were unable to estimate the customer return rates and the expected warranty accrual needed on sales of our consumer product  we deferred all consumer product revenues from the palovia laser until the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had sufficient history to be able to estimate our customer return rates and the expected warranty accrual needed on sales of our consumer product 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized million of consumer product revenues related to the palovia laser 
service revenues 
service revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our service organization to provide ongoing service  sales of replacement handpieces  sales of consumables and accessories  and billable repairs of our professional products 
customer service revenues decreased by in as compared to  primarily due to lower sales from replacement handpieces  consumables  and accessories 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information about our total professional product segment s product and service revenues  by geographic region year ended december  north america europe middle east asia pacific rim south and central america australia japan total all consumer product segment revenues are currently derived solely from sales in the united states 
in march  japan experienced an earthquake and tsunami which has had a significant impact on japan s economy and infrastructure 
during  of our product and service revenue was generated from japan 
since the earthquake and tsunami occurred toward the end of the first quarter  we believe that these events did not seriously impact our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of none of our assets were damaged 
we also believe that these events did not seriously impact our consolidated financial statements for any of the quarters during the year ended december  however  in the coming quarters  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and services in japan and an insignificant impact on our consolidated financial statements and continuing operations as japan struggles to rebuild its economy and infrastructure 
the decrease in demand will be difficult to quantify  but is currently not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to assess the effect of the earthquake and tsunami on the company s consolidated financial statements and will disclose any significant effects as necessary 
royalty revenues

 in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and a decline in the stock market 
the current turbulence in the us and global financial markets has caused a decline in stock values across all industries 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments  municipal debt securities  and variable demand obligations is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial because of the historically short term nature of these investments 
at december   we held million in ars 
the ars we invest in are high quality securities  none of which are mortgage backed 
beginning in february  our securities failed at auction due to a decline in liquidity in the ars and other capital markets 
we will not be able to access our investments in ars until future auctions are successful  ars are called for redemption by the issuers  or until sold in a secondary market 
as our investments in ars currently lack short term liquidity  we have classified these investments as non current as of december  and during fiscal   and  we sold million  million  and million  respectively  of our ars 
the recovery of the remaining million ars held is based upon market factors which are not within our control 
our international subsidiaries in the netherlands  australia  japan  germany  and spain conduct business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and the corresponding variability in operating results as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
