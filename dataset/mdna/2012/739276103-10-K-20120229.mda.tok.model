item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
business overview we design  develop  manufacture and market high voltage  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits  or ics  and high voltage diodes for use in electronic power supplies  also known as switched mode power supplies 
our ics and diodes are used principally in ac dc power supplies in a wide variety of end products  primarily in the consumer  communications  computer and industrial electronics markets 
for example  our ics are commonly used in such end products as mobile phone chargers  desktop computers  home entertainment equipment  appliances  utility meters and led light bulbs and fixtures 
we believe that our products enable power supplies that are superior to those designed with alternative technologies 
we differentiate our ics through innovation aimed at helping our customers meet the desired performance specifications for their power supplies  including increasingly stringent energy efficiency requirements  while minimizing complexity  component count  time to market and overall system cost 
we invest significant resources in research and development in an effort to achieve this differentiation 
while the size of the power supply market fluctuates with changes in macroeconomic conditions  the market has generally exhibited a modest growth rate over time as growth in the unit volumes of power supplies has largely been offset by reductions in the average selling price of components in this market 
therefore  the growth of our business depends primarily on our penetration of the power supply market  and our success in expanding the addressable market by introducing new products that address a wider range of applications 
our growth strategy includes the following elements increase the penetration of our ics in the low power ac dc power supply market 
the vast majority of our revenues come from power supply applications requiring watts of output or less 
we continue to introduce more advanced products that make our ic based solutions more attractive in this market 
we have also increased the size of our sales and field engineering staff considerably in recent years  and we continue to expand our offerings of technical documentation and design support tools and services in order to help customers use our ics 
these tools and services include our pi expert design software  which we offer free of charge  and our transformer sample service 
capitalize on the growing demand for more energy efficient electronic products and lighting technologies 
we believe that energy efficiency is becoming an increasingly important design criterion for power supplies due largely to the emergence of standards and specifications that encourage  and in some cases mandate  the design of more energy efficient electronic products 
while power supplies built with competing technologies are often unable to meet these standards cost effectively  power supplies incorporating our ics are generally able to comply with all known efficiency specifications currently in effect 
additionally  technological advances combined with regulatory and legislative actions are resulting in the adoption of alternative lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes  or led 
we believe this presents a significant opportunity for us because our ics are used in power supply  or driver  circuitry for high voltage led lighting applications 
increase the penetration of our products in high power applications 
we believe we have developed and acquired new technologies and products that enable us to bring the benefits of highly integrated power supplies to applications requiring more than watts of output 
these include such applications as main power supplies for flat panel tvs and desktop pcs  as well as power supplies for led streetlights  game consoles  and notebook computers  among others 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuations 
we plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of projected customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
customers typically may cancel or reschedule orders on short notice without significant penalty and  
table of contents conversely  often place orders with very short lead times to delivery 
also  external factors such as global economic conditions and supply chain dynamics can cause our operating results to be volatile 
our net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the slight decline in revenues from to reflected general industry conditions  specifically a slowdown in industry wide demand in the second half of the year 
revenues from the consumer end market  our largest end market in terms of revenues  were down slightly compared with the prior year  while revenues from the communications end market  our second largest end market  were down by a high single digit percentage from the prior year 
these declines were largely offset by higher sales into the industrial and computer end markets 
the growth of revenues from to reflected an industry wide recovery in demand following the economic downturn of  as well as the increased penetration of our products into our addressable markets 
our top ten customers  including distributors that resell to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
our top two customers  both distributors of our products  collectively accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
in  international sales comprised of net revenues  and in and  international sales comprised of our net revenues 
because our industry is intensely price sensitive  our gross margin gross profit divided by net revenues is subject to change based on the relative pricing of solutions that compete with ours 
variations in product mix  end market mix and customer mix can also cause our gross margin to fluctuate 
also  because we purchase a large percentage of our silicon wafers from foundries located in japan  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would eventually result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately percentage point  this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from some of our japanese suppliers 
also  although our wafer fabrication and assembly operations are outsourced  as are most of our test operations  a portion of our production costs are fixed in nature 
as such  our unit costs and gross profit margin are impacted by the volume of units we produce 
our gross profit  defined as net revenues less cost of revenues  was million  or of net revenues  in  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was due primarily to higher input costs as well as a less favorable product mix  the increase in input costs was driven primarily by increased depreciation expense for machinery and equipment to expand our production capacity  the decline in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  which has increased the cost of silicon wafers purchased from some of our japanese wafer fabrication foundries and the rise in the prices of some materials  primarily gold and copper  used in the assembly of our products 
the increase in our gross margin in compared to was driven by manufacturing efficiencies due to increased production volumes  which resulted in lower fixed costs per unit  and a favorable end market mix  as a higher percentage of our revenues came from the industrial and consumer end markets  which tend to have higher margins than other end markets 
we are working to increase our gross margin through a combination of product cost reductions and the development of new products and technologies aimed at increasing the value of our ics to customers 
total operating expenses in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses from to was driven primarily by i increased payroll and related expenses due to increased headcount  including higher research and development headcount resulting from an acquisition we completed in the third quarter of for details see note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  ii increases in sales and marketing headcount as a result of growth in our sales force and iii increased product development and materials expenses related to foundry qualifications and ongoing new product development 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
the increase in operating expenses in compared to was driven primarily by i increased payroll and related expenses as a result of increased headcount in research and development  due in part to the acquisition we completed in the third quarter of mentioned above and ii headcount increases and other expenses in sales and marketing in order to support the record number of new product families we introduced in while our operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future  over time our aim is to increase them at a rate lower than the growth rate of our revenues 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
table of contents the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those listed below 
we base our estimates on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  stock based compensation  estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  and goodwill and intangible assets 
our critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a brief description of these critical accounting policies is set forth below 
for more information regarding our accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenues consist of sales to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  merchant power supply manufacturers and distributors 
approximately of our net product sales were made to distributors in we apply the provisions of accounting standard codification asc asc and all related appropriate guidance 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customer 
we evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
with respect to collectability  we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers financial condition and requires letters of credit whenever deemed necessary 
sales to international oem customers and merchant power supply manufacturers that are shipped from our facility in california are pursuant to delivered at frontier  or daf  shipping terms 
as such  title to the product passes to the customer when the shipment reaches the destination country and revenue is recognized upon the arrival of the product in that country 
sales to international oems and merchant power supply manufacturers for shipments from our facility outside of the united states are pursuant to ex works  or exw  shipping terms  meaning that title to the product transfers to the customer upon shipment from our foreign warehouse 
shipments to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers in the americas are pursuant to free on board  or fob  point of origin shipping terms meaning that title is passed to the customer upon shipment 
revenue is recognized upon title transfer for sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
sales to distributors are made under terms allowing certain price adjustments and rights of return on our products held by the distributors 
as a result of these rights  we defer the recognition of revenue and the costs of revenues derived from sales to distributors until our distributors report that they have sold our products to their customers 
our recognition of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from the distributor  at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed  and the products are no longer subject to return to us except pursuant to warranty terms 
the gross profit that is deferred upon shipment to the distributor is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the total deferred revenue as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the total deferred cost as of december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
frequently  distributors need to sell at a price lower than the standard distribution price in order to win business 
at or 
table of contents soon after the distributor invoices its customer  the distributor submits a ship and debit price adjustment claim to us to adjust the distributor s cost from the standard price to the pre approved lower price 
after we verify the claim  a credit memo is issued to the distributor for the ship and debit claim 
we maintain a reserve for unprocessed claims and future ship and debit price adjustments 
the reserve appears as a reduction to accounts receivable in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent future ship and debit claims significantly exceed amounts estimated  there could be a material impact on the deferred revenue and deferred margin ultimately recognized 
to evaluate the adequacy of our reserves  we analyze historical ship and debit payments and levels of inventory in the distributor channels 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of asc  share based payment 
under the provisions of asc  we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation in our financial statements over the requisite service period of the individual grants  which generally equals a four year vesting period 
we use estimates of volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate  dividend yield and forfeitures in determining the fair value of these awards and the amount of compensation expense to recognize 
changes in these estimates could result in changes to our compensation charges 
estimating write downs for excess and obsolete inventory when evaluating the adequacy of our valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory  we identify excess and obsolete products and also analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends and historical write offs 
this write down is reflected as a reduction to inventory in the consolidated balance sheets and an increase in cost of revenues 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  we may be required to take additional write downs  which could adversely impact our cost of revenues and operating results 
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc under the provisions of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management s judgment 
we limit the deferred tax assets recognized related to some of our officers compensation to amounts that we estimate will be deductible in future periods based upon internal revenue code section m 
in the event that we determine  based on available evidence and management judgment  that all or part of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future  we would record a valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
as of december   we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our california deferred tax assets as we believe that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
we also maintain a valuation allowance with respect to some of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to tax credits in some non us jurisdictions 
in the first quarter of  the irs informed us that it intends to propose material adjustments to our taxable income for fiscal years through related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and related issues 
in december  we received an addendum to the notice of proposed adjustments from the irs related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement 
we believe the irs s position with respect to the proposed adjustment is inconsistent with applicable tax law  and that we have a meritorious defense to our position 
accordingly  we intend to continue to challenge the irs s position on this matter vigorously 
while we believe the irs s asserted position on this matter is not supported by applicable law  we have provided reserves for our position in this matter  and we may be required to make payments to the irs pending resolution of this matter 
if this matter is litigated and the irs is able to successfully sustain its position  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected refer to note  
table of contents provision for income taxes  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
resolution of this matter is not anticipated within the next year 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or as other indicators of impairment emerge 
the provisions of asc require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the implied fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount no impairment adjustment is required 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value  step two will be completed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any exists 
if the carrying value of our single reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference  but not in excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarters of and  and concluded that no impairment existed as of december  and december  asc also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  such as acquired intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
results of operations the following table sets forth some operating data in dollars  as a percentage of total net revenues and the increase decrease over prior periods for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands

total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations total other income income before provision for income tax provision for income taxes net income comparison of years ended december   and net revenues 
net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus  in  license fees and royalties 
the slight decline in revenues from to reflected general industry conditions  specifically a slowdown in industry wide demand in the second half of the year 
revenues from the consumer end market  our largest end market in terms of revenues  were down slightly compared with the prior year  while 
table of contents revenues from the communications end market  our second largest end market  were down by a high single digit percentage from the prior year 
these declines were largely offset by higher sales into the industrial and computer end markets 
net revenues increased from to  reflecting an industry wide recovery in demand following the economic downturn of  as well as the increased penetration of our products into our addressable markets 
our net revenue mix by product family and by the end markets served in  and were as follows year ended december  product family tinyswitch linkswitch topswitch other year ended december  end market consumer communications industrial electronics computer sales to customers outside of the americas were million in  compared to million in and million in  representing approximately of net revenues in  and of net revenues in both and although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of these power supplies are manufactured by our customers in asia 
as a result  sales to this region were approximately of our net revenues in  and we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
distributors accounted for  and of our net product sales for the years ended december   and  respectively  with direct sales to oems and power supply manufacturers accounting for the remainder in each of the corresponding years 
in  and  two distributors  avnet and atm electronic corporation  each accounted for more than of revenues 
the table below includes net revenues from each of these customers for the three years ended december  year ended december  customer avnet atm electronic corporation no other customers accounted for or more of net revenues during these years 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from our contracted foundries  the assembly  packaging and testing of our products by sub contractors  product testing performed in our own facility  and overhead associated with the management of our supply chain 
gross margin is gross profit divided by net revenues 
the table below compares gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december   and dollars in millions 
table of contents year ended december  net revenues gross profit gross margin the decrease in our gross margin in compared to was due primarily to higher input costs as well as a less favorable product mix  the increase in input costs was driven primarily by increased depreciation expense for machinery and equipment to expand our production capacity  the decline in the value of the us dollar versus the japanese yen  which has increased the cost of silicon wafers purchased from some of our japanese wafer fabrication foundries and the rise in the prices of some materials  primarily gold and copper  used in the assembly of our products 
the increase in our gross margin in compared to was driven primarily by manufacturing efficiencies due to increased production volumes  which resulted in a lower fixed cost per unit and a more favorable end market mix  as a larger percentage of our revenues came from industrial and consumer end markets  which tend to feature higher gross margins than other end markets 
these benefits were partially offset by product mix  as we experienced a significant increase in sales of recently introduced products which tend to have lower gross margins than earlier generation products 
the increase in our gross margin was also partially offset by the increase in the price of gold  which put upward pressure on the cost of producing our ics 
research and development expenses 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses including stock based compensation and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also record r d expenses for prototype wafers related to new products until the products are released to production 
the table below compares r d expenses for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues r d expenses r d expenses as a of net revenues r d expenses increased in compared to the prior year primarily due to an acquisition completed in august of which increased headcount and payroll related expenses 
this acquisition also resulted in increased depreciation and facilities expenses see note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
product development and materials expenses also increased year over year due to expenses related to foundry qualifications and ongoing new product development 
these increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense 
in  our established performance targets for vesting of our performance based awards were not met  resulting in no expense for performance based awards in in  r d expenses increased compared with  due primarily to increased payroll and related expenses as a result of increased headcount  due in part to the acquisition mentioned above 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  commissions to sales representatives  and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
the table below compares sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a of net revenue sales and marketing expenses increased in compared to  driven primarily by increased payroll and related expenses as well as travel and sales infrastructure expenses as a result of increased headcount to expand our international sales 
table of contents force 
the increases were partially offset by decreased bonus and commission expense as well as lower stock based compensation expense as described above 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased compared with  driven primarily by increased payroll and related expenses and increased commission expense  resulting from increased headcount  higher revenues and promotional activities associated with new product launches 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including stock based compensation expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  professional services  legal and auditing expenses 
the table below compares g a expenses for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues g a expenses g a expenses as a of net revenue g a expenses decreased in compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to reduced stock based compensation expense as described above  and reduced acquisition related expenses we acquired two businesses in  refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  for details 
these decreases were partially offset by increased salaries and related expenses resulting from increased headcount to support our overall employee growth 
g a expenses increased in compared to  due primarily to expenses associated with acquisitions and other strategic transactions  and higher patent litigation expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
the table below compares other income  net for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  net revenues other income other income as a of net revenue other income  net remained flat in the three years ended december   and  due primarily to relatively stable interest rates as well as similar levels of cash and investments 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the table below compares the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and dollars in millions year ended december  income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of for the year ended december   due primarily to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings as well as a federal research tax credit partially offset by a valuation allowance on our california deferred tax asset 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings  the favorable impacts of the extension of the federal research tax credit for and the federal investment tax credit on our solar power installation 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings partially offset by the establishment of a partial valuation allowance on our california deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments at december  compared to million at december   and million at december  as of december   and we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our operating activities generated cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in each of these years  cash was primarily generated from operating activities in the ordinary course of business 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was million  we also incurred non cash depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
additional sources of cash included a million decrease in inventories due to reduced wafer purchases and a million increase in accrued liabilities resulting primarily from an increase in our long term tax liability 
these sources of cash were partially offset by a million decrease in deferred income on sales to distributors resulting from decreased inventory levels at our distributors and a million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of ship and debit and sales rebate credits in the fourth quarter of  versus the fourth quarter of cash provided by operating activities totaled million in the year ended december  our net income for this period was million  we also incurred non cash depreciation and amortization expenses and stock based compensation expenses of million and million  respectively 
additional sources of cash included million in decreased accounts receivable associated with improved collections as well as the timing of ship and debit credit settlements with distributors and million increase in income tax and other payables 
these sources of cash were offset by a million increase in inventory due to higher production volumes in response to higher demand for our products along with new product launches  and an million net increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  driven mainly by a payment of million for a prepaid royalty for details see note  investment in third party  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in the year ended december  our net income accounted for million of this amount

this included a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  reflecting a prepaid royalty of million  our investment in a third party of million  and prepaid legal expenses of million  partially offset by other net activity of million 
another significant use of cash was an increase in accounts receivable of million  reflecting an increase in revenue in december versus the same period in factors increasing our cash provided by operating activities included an increase in accounts payable of million  reflecting the timing of payments to our suppliers  an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors of million  reflecting increased shipments to our distributors in december versus december  and an increase in taxes payable and other accrued liabilities of million  primarily reflecting increased accrued income taxes 
our investing activities in the year ended december  resulted in a million net use of cash  consisting primarily of i million for purchases of property and equipment  primarily manufacturing equipment to support our growth as well as building improvements in connection with our research and development facility in new jersey  ii million paid in relation to the acquisition of qspeed refer to note  acquisitions  in our notes to consolidated financial statements  iii million in connection with our lease line of credit to semisouth refer to note  lease line to third party  in our notes to consolidated financial statements and iv million  net  for purchases of held to maturity investments

this cash usage was partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock  including the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
our financing activities in resulted in net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from financing activities included million from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee stock options  and ii million of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised 
these sources of cash were partially offset by i million for the repurchase of our common stock  million for the payment of dividends to stockholders and million for the repurchase and retirement of shares related to employee income tax withholding 
our financing activities in resulted in a net million use of cash 
the use of cash consisted primarily of the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock for million  the cash payment of million to our employees in relation to our tender offer in december  and the million payment of dividends to stockholders in this use of cash was partially offset by million in proceeds as a result of exercises of employee stock options and from the issuance of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we entered into an unsecured credit agreement with a bank  which we refer to as the credit agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we can request advances in an amount not to exceed an aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which can be used for working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  the agreement also covers advances for commercial letters of credit 
for advances under the credit agreement  interest is due monthly  and principal is due at maturity in february with prepayments permitted at no penalty 
interest under the credit agreement is  at our option  libor plus a margin or prime 
we do not pay an undrawn commitment fee 
the terms of the credit agreement require us to remain in compliance with some covenants  including maintenance of specified levels of liquidity and tangible net worth  we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
we currently have an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of million in connection with our contingent purchase commitment for semisouth s intellectual property see note  investment in third party  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
as of december  the balance of this credit line is unused and available 
we paid dividends on a quarterly basis in  and  which resulted in approximately a million use of cash per quarter in and  and a million use of cash per quarter in the dividends in and were per share per quarter  and in were per share per quarter 
in january  our board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share to be paid at the end of each quarter in the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  business conditions and other factors  as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders 
from may  to december   we purchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million  and in the first two quarters of we purchased million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
in february  our board of directors authorized the use of million for the repurchase of our common stock 
from february to december  we repurchased million shares for a total cost of million  concluding this repurchase program 
in november  our board of directors authorized the use of an additional million for the repurchase of our common stock 
repurchases in connection with this plan will be executed according to some pre defined price volume guidelines set by the board of directors for repurchases in there is currently no expiration date for this repurchase program 

table of contents in the first quarter of  the irs informed us that it intends to propose material adjustments to our taxable income for fiscal years through related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and related issues 
in december  we received an addendum to the notice of proposed adjustments from the irs related to our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement 
we believe the irs s position with respect to the proposed adjustment is without merit  inconsistent with applicable tax law  and that we have a meritorious defense to our position 
accordingly  we intend to continue to challenge the irs s position on this matter vigorously 
while we believe the irs s asserted position on this matter is not supported by applicable law  we may be required to make additional payments to the irs pending resolution of this matter 
if this matter is litigated and the irs is able to successfully sustain its position  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
resolution of this matter is not anticipated within the next year refer to note  provision for income taxes  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may change in future periods due to changes in our planned cash outlays  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions  and the results of our irs audit 
our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations 
current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations since a significant amount of our cash and investments are held in the us in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if us tax has not already been previously provided  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes in connection with the repatriation of any funds 
if our operating results deteriorate in future periods  either as a result of a decrease in customer demand  or severe pricing pressures from our customers or our competitors  or for other reasons  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
in that case  we may be forced to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  use our current financing or seek additional financing from third parties to fund our operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we consider cash invested in highly liquid financial instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than three months but not longer than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as short term investments 
investments in highly liquid financial instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long term investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage our interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  or for any other purpose 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to facilitate portfolio liquidity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
at december  and we held primarily cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments with fixed interest rates 
our investment securities are subject to market interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
to minimize market risk  most of our investments subject to market risk mature in less than one year  and therefore if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by from interest rates as of december  or december   the increase or decrease in the fair market value of our portfolio on these dates would not have been material 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a tabular presentation of our held to maturity investments and the expected maturity dates 
in the event that the carrying value of our investments exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we will reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
as of december  none of our investments were impaired 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our primary transactional currency is us dollars  however we also have sales offices in various foreign countries in which our expenses are denominated in the local currency  primarily asia and western europe 
currently  we do not employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
two of our major suppliers  epson and lapis  have wafer supply agreements based in us dollars  however  our agreements with epson and lapis also allow for mutual sharing of the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation between japanese yen and the us dollar 
each year  our management and these suppliers review and negotiate pricing  the negotiated pricing is denominated in us dollars but is subject to contractual exchange rate provisions 
the fluctuation in the exchange rate is shared equally between power integrations and each of these suppliers 

table of contents nevertheless  as a result of our above mentioned supplier agreements  our gross margin is influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
all else being equal  a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the japanese yen would result in a corresponding change in our gross margin of approximately percentage point  this sensitivity may increase or decrease depending on the percentage of our wafer supply that we purchase from some of our japanese suppliers and could subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 
at december   and december   we did not have material cash or investments denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore had no material foreign currency exchange risk related to our cash and investments
