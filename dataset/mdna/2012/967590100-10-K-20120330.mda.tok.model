current trends  economic environment and outlook our target market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service offerings 
our largest competitors are expanding their service offerings through targeted acquisitions of specialty it companies 
there are high barriers to entry into our market space due to the specialized technical nature of our products and services delivered and scalability is essential to operating profitably 
business development requires significant expertise and deep federal and commercial networks to compete effectively against more established companies 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  due to revenues earned on contracts  the number of billable days in a quarter  the timing of the pass through of other direct costs  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts  the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions 
because a significant portion of our expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the federal government s fiscal year ends september th and if a budget for the next fiscal year has not been approved by that date  some of our clients may have to suspend engagements that we are working on until a budget has been approved 
congressional budget continuing resolutions  which provide for funding of federal agencies at prior year spending levels may impact new awards and cause us to realize lower revenues until such time as the federal budget process for the fiscal period has been completed 
further  a change in senior government officials may negatively affect the rate at which the federal government purchases the services that we offer 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful 
our commercial customer base is sensitive to general economic conditions and regulatory and legislative actions that may affect their domestic and or international operations 
we continue to evaluate domestic and international market conditions as any significant decline in economic activity may negatively affect the financial condition of our customers and conversely their willingness to purchase additional products and services 
although there appeared to be improved domestic and international market conditions through fiscal  there has not been a full recovery to pre recessionary levels and there remains uncertainty with regard to the stability of our fragile domestic recovery in fiscal clearly there remain many challenges to address both domestic and international regarding weak long term job creation  volatile consumer confidence  uncertain consumer behavior  an uncertain real estate market and regulatory and legislative environment as we approach the presidential election year 
we remain focused on continued retention and expansion of services to our existing customer base and attracting new customers in the government and commercial sectors 
at the end of fiscal  we increased our reach in the commercial sector with the avalon global solutions  inc ags asset purchase completed through our wholly owned subsidiary widepoint solutions corp 
in fiscal  our consolidated revenue base will be more diversified between government and commercial clients 
we intend to cross sell additional services to ags s existing customer base and leverage our existing customer relationships to reach new customers worldwide 
we are continuing to actively search out new synergistic acquisitions that we believe may further enhance our present base of business and service offerings 
we remain focused on efficient use of our infrastructure  optimizing our operating costs and centralizing certain functions and procedures during fiscal our profitability depends upon both the type and volume of services performed and the company s ability to efficiently manage costs 
our staff consists of business process and computer specialists who help our government and civilian customers augment and expand their resident technologic skills and competencies  drive technical innovation  and help develop and maintain a competitive edge in today s rapidly changing technological environment in business 
as a significant portion of our recurring cost structure is labor related  we must effectively manage these costs to achieve and grow our profitability 
another significant portion of our cost structure includes our airtime plans and other vendor related offerings under our communications management services 
to date  the company has attempted to maximize its operating margins through efficiencies achieved by the use of its proprietary methodologies  and by offsetting increases in consultant compensation with increases in consultant fees received from its clients 
critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies referenced  as applicable  to other notes 
the following chart provides information about certain critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that require significant management assumptions and judgments 
intangible assets description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 
the company recognizes the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
the fair values of the intangible assets purchased were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach 
when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach  the company estimates future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal five year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions 
the company then applies a discount rate to discount these future cash flows to arrive at a net present value amount  which represents the estimated fair value of each intangible 
the discount rate applied approximates the expected cost of equity financing  determined using a capital asset pricing model 
the model generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in an investment 
the company has approximately million of purchased intangibles as of december  the fair value of each of the company s intangibles continue to generate positive returns and is above its carrying value  accordingly  the company has concluded its purchased intangibles is not impaired at december  the company could be exposed to increased risk of recoverability to the extent revenue estimates may not support the recovery of purchased intangible assets revenue recognition description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions our wireless mobility invoice management and payment services requires the company to purchase bands of minutes  text messaging and data services from large carriers and optimizes these services for its mobile customers 
the company recognizes revenues and related costs on a gross basis for these arrangements as we have discretion in choosing providers  rate plans  and devices in providing the services to our customers 
we establish pricing for our customer contracts 
for arrangements in which we do not have such credit risk we recognize revenues and related costs on a net basis if estimated carrier services and equipment costs are significantly different or estimated device counts are not accurate it could materially affect the estimated revenues and related costs reported and trends 
our proprietary public key infrastructure pki credentialing service is delivered as an on demand managed service and is sold on an individual basis or in a bulk transaction 
pki credentials involve the sale of an software certificates issued by the company 
revenue is recognized from the sales of credentials upon issuance 
pricing for certificates issued by the company are based on third party evidence of value 
certificates issued have a fixed life and cannot be modified or reissued 
there is no obligation to provide post contract services in relation to certificates issued and consoles delivered 
if actual certificate issuance counts are not accurate on a cumulative basis it could after the recognition of credential sales we procure and resell telecommunication services and devices to the customer and recognizes revenue upon receipt of inventory and bills the customer at cost plus applicable contractual fees earned 
the company recognizes revenues and related costs on a gross basis for these arrangements as we have discretion in choosing providers  rate plans  and devices in providing the services to our customers 
for arrangements in which we do not have such credit risk we recognize revenues and related costs on a net basis if our ability to exercise discretion in selecting communications carriers  rate plans or devices changes it could significantly affect the amount of reported revenues and related costs and revenue trends we provide a variety of telecommunication management consulting services and charges a fee for time and materials incurred or a contingent fee based on expected savings or other metric 
contingent fees are highly subjective and may be subject to adjustment in the event the customer does not agree with the determination revenue on time and material arrangements is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred to deliver consulting services 
revenue on contingent fee arrangements are recognized upon customer acceptance of proposed billing if expected savings are significantly below actual savings it could significantly affect reported revenues and result in margin compression we procure and resell third party hardware software products and maintenance services under cost reimbursable contracts 
timing of the sale may require us to make a material estimate of earned revenues and related costs for which final invoicing has not yet been received revenue and related costs are recognized on a gross basis as the company bears significant risk as it exercises significant discretion in establishing technical requirements and choosing equipment 
pricing is based on third party evidence of value tpe 
hardware elements are separately procured and priced through third party vendors who deal in such equipment 
if estimated hardware software and or maintenance costs are significantly different from actual t could materially affect the estimated revenues and related costs reported and trends 
goodwill description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually at december and between annual tests if events or circumstances arise  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing 
a reporting unit is defined as either an operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews 
the goodwill impairment test utilizes a two step approach 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment  requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  such as the market approach earnings multiples or transaction multiples for the industry in which the reporting unit operates or the income approach discounted cash flow methods 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach 
when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach  the company estimates future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal five year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions 
the company then applies a discount rate to discount these future cash flows to arrive at a net present value amount  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied approximates the expected cost of equity financing  determined using a capital asset pricing model 
the model generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in an investment 
the company has approximately million of goodwill as of december  the fair value of each of the company s reporting units is above its carrying value  accordingly  the company has concluded its goodwill is not impaired at december  the company could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions allowances for doubtful accounts relating to commercial accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable represent management s best estimate of the losses inherent in the company s outstanding trade accounts receivable 
there have not been historical losses on government accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are written off when management deems amounts to be uncollectible and is generally determined by the number of days past due 
trade accounts receivable are generally written off no later than days past due 
receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are written off upon notification 
recoveries of receivables are recognized on a cash basis to the extent historical credit experience updated for emerging market trends in credit is not indicative of future performance  actual losses could differ significantly from management s judgments and expectations  resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for losses  as applicable 
the process of determining the allowance for doubtful accounts requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions share based compensation description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company issues share based compensation awards to company employees upon which the fair value of awards is subject to significant estimates made by management 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model black scholes model  which uses the assumptions of no dividend yield  risk free interest rates and expected life in years of approximately years 
the option awards are for the period from through expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant to the extent historical volatility estimates  risk free interest rates  option terms and forfeiture rates updated for emerging market trends is not indicative of future performance it could differ significantly from management s judgments and expectations on the fair value of similar share based awards  resulting in either higher or lower future compensation expense  as applicable 
the process of determining fair value of share based compensation requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions accounting for income taxes description assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the financial statements  certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making this assessment  management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income  reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
these assessments are performed quarterly  taking into account any new information should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset including our utilization of historical net operating losses  the company records or adjusts the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts or circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or decrease to the income tax provision in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see note to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
recently adopted accounting standards supplementary pro forma information for business combinations in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the update requires that the pro forma information for business combinations to be presented as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual reporting period when calculating both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination 
the amended guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted this update in the fourth quarter of in connection with a business combination 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table sets forth selected segment and consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated 
segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
management does not analyze assets for decision making purposes as it is not a significant factor 
accordingly  information is not available for long lived assets or total assets 
for the year ended december  communications cyber management security consulting corporate total revenues    income loss from operations   net interest income expense  net other income expense net income before provision for income taxes  net income tax benefit  net income    for the year ended december  communications cyber management security consulting corporate total revenues    income loss from operations   net interest income expense  net other income expense net income before provision for income taxes  net income tax benefit  net income     revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  a decrease of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was materially a result of the deferral of anticipated awards attributable to the us federal government budget and debt ceiling issues  which negatively affected the issuance of several task orders and contracts  along with a reduction in billable calling minutes as we have shifted our focus towards a mix of higher margin managed services within our communications management segment 
communications management segment revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  a decrease of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was predominantly related to a reduction in billable calling minutes and billable services provided to washington headquarter services whs that was not fully offset by increases in work attributable to the expansion with other customers and new contract awards entered into during fiscal we are presently pursuing several significant service contract award opportunities at a number of federal agencies and we also initiated a new strategy to expand into state and local municipalities and commercial enterprises through strategic acquisitions and by utilizing intermediary sales channels  as well as expanded direct sales efforts that will expand our reach beyond the federal sector and help support the long term growth of this segment 
cybersecurity solutions segment revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  a decrease of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the deferral of anticipated awards attributable to the us federal government budget and debt ceiling issues which negatively affected the issuance of several task orders and contracts 
we anticipate segment growth will be driven by a recent directive issued by the us office of management and budget omb which mandates near term utilization of approved public key infrastructure certificates to access federal government sites 
we anticipate that this mandate could potentially affect over  civilian contractors that require periodic and recurring access to conduct their work 
this mandate will be phased in through similarly  the us department of justice doj joint personnel adjudication system jpas and the national security agency s acquisition resource center arc have announced that compliance will be required in we anticipate that other gateways may also require compliance to satisfy the requirements of omb 
we have entered into a number of strategic alliance with partner s that facilitate access to various federal agencies and their related technology infrastructures in order to take advantage of these identity management implementation mandates 
we believe these new partnerships provide additional reach to meet our growth objectives 
consulting services and products segment revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million  a decrease of million  as compared to revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was to the net result of improvements by our commercial consulting activities  which were then more than offset by a decrease in our federal government related consulting and reselling activities in fiscal we anticipate moderate growth in this segment given the nature and variability of the products and services we offer 
future performance and the continuity of growth may prove erratic from period to period 
cost of revenues consolidated cost of revenues for the year ended december   were approximately million or of consolidated revenues  a decrease of million  as compared to cost of revenues of approximately million or of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  cost of sales increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues primarily due to a lower percentage of higher margin cybersecurity services and a higher percentage of lower margin consulting products and services 
we anticipate improvements in our costs of sales as we pursue delivery of higher margin services and products 
at times  the fluctuation in our lower margin services offered through our consulting services and products and our communications management segments may cause variability in our cost of sales 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues  a decrease of million as compared to gross profit of approximately million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  gross profit declined as a result of a lower percentage of higher margin revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or of revenues  as compared to approximately million or of revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in business development activities for new customer contracts  recruiting costs to attract and retain new personnel  consultants  and costs to exhibit tradeshows and conferences to reach our target market 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or of revenues  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to million or of revenues  for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to our internal efforts to strengthen our infrastructure and centralize certain functions to support a growing infrastructure 
as we expand the business these costs may increase on an absolute dollar basis  but on a percentage basis these costs should stabilize and or fall 
depreciation expense depreciation expense  net of depreciation in cost of revenues  for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  an increase of approximately  as compared to approximately  of such expenses or less than of revenues  recorded by the company for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the increased pool of depreciable assets 
interest income expense interest income for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  a decrease of approximately  as compared to approximately  or less than of revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in was primarily attributable to lower interest rates payable on bank accounts in comparison to interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues  a decrease of approximately  as compared to approximately  or less than of revenues of interest expense for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in was primarily attributable to lesser expenses associated with the debt instruments issued by the company in connection with the acquisition of isys 
we expect interest expense to rise due to debt incurred to fund the asset purchase of avalon global solutions  inc at the end of the fourth quarter of income taxes income tax benefit for the year ended december  was approximately  or less than of revenues as compared to an income tax benefit of approximately million or approximately of revenues for the year ended december  the company analyzed its ability to utilize net operating losses currently recorded as deferred tax assets and based on this analysis determined that it was more likely than not that the company would be able to utilize its net operating losses in future periods 
net income as a result of the above  the net income for the year ended december  was approximately  a decrease of million  as compared to the net income of approximately million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
the company s primary sources of liquidity for the year ended december  were cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and unbilled receivables 
the company s operating liabilities are largely predictable and consist of vendor and payroll obligations 
at december   the company s net working capital was approximately million representing a decline in net working capital of approximately million compared to the same period a year ago 
the decrease in net working capital in fiscal is principally attributable to cash used to finance the asset purchase of ags on december  the company s operations require substantial working capital to fund the future growth of its business and move forward with sales and marketing efforts  and planned capital expenditures 
at december   there were no material commitments for additional acquisitions or capital expenditures  but that could change with the addition of material contract awards in any of our segments 
the company has an available revolving line of credit up to million to fund operations and expansion activities 
at december   there were no borrowings against this available revolving line of credit 
cash provided by operating activities provides an indication of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our recurring business activities 
for the year ended december  operating cash flow was approximately million  as compared to approximately million the same period last year 
there were no significant changes in customer collections or change in settlement terms of vendor liabilities 
cash portions of the earnout payable to the former owner of isys of approximately  and  are included in the accrued expenses at december  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities provides an indication of our long term infrastructure investments 
we make recurring purchases of property and equipment to replace or enhance our hardware and software applications that support customer operations 
we also make investments in software development related to our proprietary communications management applications and pki software certificate credentialing managed services 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was approximately million compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
the increase in cash used in investing activities principally related to the december  asset purchase of ags by the company s wholly owned subsidiary wsc 
for the year ended december  our investment activities principally consisted of investments in technology equipment and additional investment in software development for our cybersecurity segment 
cash provided by financing activities provides an indication of our equity and debt capital raises and repayment of those obligations 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was approximately million compared to approximately  in the same period last year 
the increase in borrowings principally related to debt financing consisting of a million bank term note which was used to finance the remaining cash portion of the ags asset purchase on december  we believe our current cash position and available line of credit is sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements through our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change with periods of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change our performance and outlook 
future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  technological changes and market acceptance of the company s services 
however  constant growth and technological change in our market makes it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
over the longer term  the company must successfully execute its plans to increase revenue and income streams that will generate significant positive cash flows if it is to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources 
the company must also continue to generate positive cash flows to support our debt service and the continued pay down of our outstanding term note 
additionally  a major expansion might require external financing that could include additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations  as increased costs to the company have generally been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could substantially differ from those estimates 
this report contains forward looking statements setting forth the company s beliefs or expectations relating to future revenues and profitability 
actual results may differ materially from projected or expected results due to changes in the demand for the company s products and services  uncertainties relating to the results of operations  dependence on its major customers  risks associated with rapid technological change and the emerging services market  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  and its dependence on key employees and other risks and uncertainties affecting the technology industry generally 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
