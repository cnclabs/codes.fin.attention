item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders  including holders who have previously converted their convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes due the convertible senior notes have a conversion price equivalent to per share 
upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  some or all of the ownership interests of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although the capped call transaction is expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  the conversion of our convertible senior notes could still have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the cap price of per share for the capped call 
any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the anticipated conversion of our convertible senior notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock 
we have a substantial level of indebtedness and future obligations relative to our cash position 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and convertible senior notes outstanding with an aggregate principal amount of million 
in addition  we have various other short term obligations which will require use of our cash to satisfy 
this level of debt and our ability to repay or refinance this debt prior to maturity could have negative consequences to our business  including increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  therefore reducing our ability to use or cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  limiting our ability to pursue our growth strategy  limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness or obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes  placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and may be better able to use their cash flow to fund competitive responses to changing industry  market or economic conditions  and increasing our vulnerability in the event of an increase in interest rates if we must incur new debt to satisfy our obligations under the convertible senior notes 
if required to fund operations  refinance debt or for other general corporate purposes  we have million available for borrowing under our secured revolving line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank  which matures september  the line of credit is however subject to certain financial covenants and may not be available  in full or in part  on dates we may attempt to draw on the line in the future 
we may also be unable to borrow funds as a result of an inability of financial institutions to lend due to restrictive lending policies and or institutional liquidity concerns 
if we experience a decline in revenues  we could have difficulty paying amounts due on our indebtedness 
any default under our indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of embedded wireless infrastructure solutions for telecom  aerospace  defense and public safety applications 
radisys market leading atca  ip media server  com express  rackmount server platforms  and world renowned trillium software coupled with an expert professional services organization and market expertise enable customers to bring high value products and services to market faster with lower investment and risk 
radisys solutions are used in a wide variety of g g lte mobile network applications including ran solutions from femtocells to picocells and macrocells  wireless core network applications  dpi and policy management  conferencing and media services including voice  video and data  as well as customized mobile network applications that support the aerospace  defense and public safety markets on july   we acquired continuous computing  a developer of communications systems consisting of highly integrated atca platforms and trillium protocol software coupled with professional services to enable a full solution offering 
continuous computing s key customer applications include g and g wireless infrastructure  small cell base stations  traffic management  internet offload and network security 
the acquisition is expected to accelerate our strategy to deliver more differentiated platforms and solutions 
continuous computing also brings expansion into high growth markets with many new customers  creating meaningful customer diversification 
as disclosed in our earnings release furnished with our form k on january   beginning in the first quarter of  we will be changing our revenue reporting to align with how management will assess its revenue internally going forward 
specifically  revenue will be disclosed in the following four product groups atca platforms  com express and rackmount server products  software and solutions and other products 
the total atca platforms and software and solutions revenue represent the previously disclosed next generation communications networks revenue  com express and rackmount server revenue represent most of the previously disclosed commercial products revenue and other products revenue represents the previously disclosed legacy communications revenue as well as previously reported commercial products revenue that is not com express or rackmount server products 
as this change is occurring prospectively  our management s discussion and analysis is aligned with our revenue reporting policy existing through however  the following table includes a summary of our revenues for under the new reporting policy for informational purposes in thousands year ended december  atca platforms com express and rackmount server software and solutions other products total revenues results of operations summary our july acquisition of continuous computing had a significant impact on financial results 
subsequent to the acquisition  continuous computing contributed million to revenues which includes a reduction in revenue of million for adjustments under the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to asc business combinations 
in addition to the purchase accounting adjustments to revenue  post acquisition revenues of continuous computing were also impacted by management product rationalization decisions to substitute our existing products in lieu of continuous computing products for certain legacy customers of continuous computing 
integration activities are proceeding as planned  however  we expect to continue to incur material acquisition related charges through the second quarter of revenues increased million in to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of continuous computing and an increase in atca revenue of million  partially offset by decline in revenue from our medical products of million 
our gross margin decreased by in to from of revenue in the decrease reflects a decline in gross margin on our legacy communication networks products  higher intangible asset amortization from the continuous computing acquisition and offset by favorable product mix as higher margin next generation communication networks products comprised a larger share of our revenue in as compared to in  we recorded million in restructuring and acquisition related charges primarily associated with the acquisition of continuous computing 
the charges include transaction and integration related costs as well as restructuring costs for the elimination of positions as we consolidate our operations on a global basis 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at the end of the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to million used for the acquisition of continuous computing  capital expenditures of million  partial repurchase of our convertible notes for million and the repurchases of our common stock for million 
these cash outflows were offset by cash generated from operating activities of million

increased revenues from our next generation communication networks products was due to a million increase in revenues from atca products as a result of increased g and g lte infrastructure deployments  the continued migration within our largest customer from legacy communication networks products  and a significant last time buy of older generation atca products 
in addition  atca revenues increased million due to the acquisition of continuous computing 
we expect further growth in our next generation communication networks products revenues in revenues in the legacy communication networks product group decreased million in as compared to as the expected decline in revenue from customers migrating to atca products more than offset a million increase in revenue due to the acquisition of continuous computing 
we expect revenues from our legacy communication networks product group to decline by approximately in due to the continued migration of our largest customer to atca products 
revenues in the communication networks product group decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was driven by the maturity of our legacy communication networks products  which resulted in a million decline in revenue when compared to partially offsetting the decline were the revenues from our next generation communication networks products 
next generation communication networks products revenue increased by million in as compared to resulting primarily from increased deployments of g and g lte infrastructure as well as telecommunication network monitoring equipment during commercial products group revenues in the commercial products group decreased million to million in from million in the decrease in revenue reflects a million decline in medical products and is partially offset by a million increase in other commercial products 
revenues from our medical products decreased primarily due to a strategic decision to de invest in our our rackmount server product line 
we expect revenues from this product line to continue to decline in  however  in management has begun reinvesting in this product line and we expect revenue growth to resume in revenues from our other commercial products reflect increased sales of our com express products to a customer in the telecommunications industry 
revenues in the commercial products group increased by million to million in from million in increased revenues from the commercial products group were driven by increased medical products revenues  which increased by million in as compared to in addition  revenues from our other commercial products group increased by million in as compared to revenues from medical products and other commercial products grew compared to the same period in primarily due to increased customer spending resulting from an overall improvement in the economy and the healthcare sector in particular 
revenue by geography the following tables outline overall revenue dollars in thousands and the percentage of revenues  by geographic region  for the years ended december change vs vs north america europe  the middle east and africa emea asia pacific total north america emea asia pacific total north america 
north american revenues increased by million to million in from million in the increase in overall north american revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million to revenues  and an increase in revenue from our other commercial products  which primarily reflects an increase in revenue from our com express products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues from our medical products and our legacy communication networks products 
north american revenues decreased by million to million in from million in the decline in overall revenues from north america was attributable to decreases in revenues from our legacy communication networks and media server products partially offset by increases from our next generation communication networks products 
emea 
revenues from the emea region decreased million to million in from million in the decrease reflects a decline in revenues from our legacy communication networks and medical products and were partially offset by increased revenues resulting from the acquisition of continuous computing  which contributed million and increased revenues from our next generation communication networks products 
increased revenues from our next generation communication networks products reflects the continued migration within our largest customer from legacy communication networks products 
revenues from the emea region decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was driven by the maturity of our legacy communication networks products 
this decrease was partially offset by increased revenues from our next generation communication networks products along with increased revenues from our medical products 
asia pacific 
revenues from the asia pacific region increased million to million in from million in the increase was the result of increased revenues from our next generation communication networks products as the result of increased g and g lte infrastructure deployments 
in addition  revenues in benefited from the acquisition of continuous computing which contributed million to revenues 
revenues from the asia pacific region decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was driven by the maturity of our legacy communication networks products 
this decrease was partially offset by increased revenues from our media server products as well as our test and measurement products 
we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to in from in gross margin was unfavorably impacted in compared to due to the continued deterioration of gross margin for legacy communication networks products and higher amortization of purchased technology  partially offset by favorable product mix as higher margin next generation communication networks products comprised a larger share of our revenues in as compared to the decline in gross margin for legacy communication networks products is due to the end of life for our higher margin legacy communication networks products combined with competitive pricing pressure on our newer legacy communication networks products 
amortization of purchased technology increased million in compared to due to the acquisition of continuous computing and offset by decreased amortization due to previously acquired purchased technology licenses that have become fully amortized 
in  gross margin was favorably impacted due to an increase in the share of next generation communication networks products as a percentage of our total revenues as compared to the prior year 
in addition to the increase in share of overall revenues  gross margin on next generation communication networks products increased as a result of reduced customer concentration coupled with the addition of trillium software and professional services obtained with the acquisition of continuous computing 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage points to in from in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was driven by increased revenues from our higher margin next generation communication networks products along with lower manufacturing and operational costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreased gross margins associated with our legacy communication networks products as these products are mostly dual sourced and we are experiencing pressure by our customers as they approach end of life 
decreases in manufacturing and operational costs are attributable to our completed transition to a fully outsourced manufacturing model 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december in thousands change vs vs research and development selling  general and administrative intangible assets amortization restructuring and acquisition related charges  net gain on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary nm nm total research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment  net of reimbursements for nonrecurring engineering services 
r d expenses increased million to million in from million in these increases are primarily due to the acquisition of continuous computing which contributed million to r d expense in  an million increase in non recurring engineering charges and a million increase in temporary labor 
these increases were offset by lower payroll and payroll related costs of million in primarily resulting from the transition of r d activities to lower cost geographies in asia 
r d expenses decreased million to million in from million in at the beginning of  we closed our boca raton  florida r d office as we transitioned the work to lower cost regions resulting in lower payroll costs 
this transition to lower cost regions combined with the closure of our boca raton office was the biggest contributing factor to the decrease in r d expense 
r d expense also declined due to lower stock based compensation costs which decreased by million in as compared to offsetting these decreases were increased costs related to the acquisition of pactolus communications software company pactolus  a developer of next generation ip communications solutions for converged time division multiplexing internet protocol and session initiation protocol enabled voip networks 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions  bonuses and benefits for sales  marketing  executive and administrative personnel  as well as professional services and costs of other general corporate activities 
sg a expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses in was primarily due to the acquisition of continuous computing which contributed an additional million to sg a expenses and increased commissions of million resulting from strong design win performance in the second half of as well as increased third party commissions 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million 
stock based compensation expense decreased due to the reversal of ltip expense for named executive officers that forfeited shares upon their departure as a result of not completing the requisite service period which was partially offset by increased expense for new grants and assumed options associated with acquisition of continuous computing 
sg a expenses increased million to million in from million in this slight increase was primarily due to increased travel expenses related to the improved economic environment along with increased professional service fees 
travel expenses and professional service fees increased by million in as compared with and was primarily attributable to our acquisition of pactolus during the first quarter of these increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation costs which decreased by million in as compared with intangible assets amortization intangible assets amortization increased million to million in from million in intangible assets amortization increased primarily due to the acquisition of continuous computing in july which contributed million to amortization expense 
the increase associated with continuous computing intangible assets was offset by a decrease of million resulting from final amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of convedia corporation convedia  a closely held vendor of ip media servers 
we perform reviews for impairment of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in  intangible asset amortization decreased million to million from million in intangible assets amortization decreased due to certain assets becoming fully amortized at the end of these decreases were partially offset by the addition of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of pactolus in restructuring and acquisition related charges  net restructuring and acquisition related charges  net include expenses associated with restructuring activities as well as integration  transaction and legal fees  and retention bonuses incurred in connection with our acquisition of continuous computing 
we evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring charges on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we record reversals to the accrued restructuring in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
the increase in restructuring and acquisition related charges  net in was due to expenses associated with our acquisition of continuous computing  including transaction costs of million  integration related costs of million and charges for restructuring activities primarily associated with the acquisition of million 
our restructuring plan that was finalized in the fourth quarter of includes the elimination of positions at various locations 
the restructuring plan is ongoing and we expect to incur additional charges under the plan through the second quarter of restructuring and acquisition related charges  net decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to restructuring activities that were initiated in related to the outsourcing of our manufacturing and the alignment of costs with our operating plans 
gain on liquidation of a foreign subsidiary during the third quarter of  as part of an update to our tax planning strategy  we completed the liquidation of radisys technology ireland limited rtil 
as a result of this liquidation  we recorded a million gain to reflect the realization of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to rtil 
this gain represents the net unrealized foreign currency translation gains accumulated from changes in exchange rates and the related effects from the translation of assets and liabilities of rtil 
stock based compensation expense included within costs of sales  r d and sg a are expenses associated with stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense consists of amortization of stock based compensation associated with unvested stock options  restricted stock units issued to employees under the stock plan  the continuous computing plan  the continuous computing inducement stock plan and the long term incentive plan ltip  and the employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred and recognized stock based compensation expense as follows for the years ended december in thousands change vs vs cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring and acquisition related charges  net total in  stock based compensation expense decreased over due to the reversal of ltip expense for named executive officers of million and was offset by additional expense associated with the acquisition of continuous computing 
in  stock based compensation expense decreased primarily due to our restructuring activities that have occurred over the past two years 
as a result  many awards have been forfeited and there has been a decrease in the participation in our espp 
in addition to lower participation  the decline in espp expense of million during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in  was also due to a liquidity discount applied to the stock based compensation calculation to reflect a one year holding period that was added to the plan at the end of partially offsetting these declines was million of additional stock based compensation during the year ended december  as compared with the same period in associated with shares granted from our ltip in the fourth quarter of non operating expenses the following table summarizes our non operating expenses for the years ended december in thousands change vs vs interest expense interest income other income expense  net total interest expense interest expense includes interest incurred on our convertible notes and our lines of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs 
in interest expense decreased million to million from million in the decrease in interest expense in was due to a decrease in the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit 
during  we had no outstanding balances or letters of credit outstanding on our line of credit 
in interest expense decreased million to million from million in the decrease in interest expense in compared to was the result of the settlement of our revolving line of credit 
interest income and other income expense  net in  interest income decreased million to million from million in due to a decline in the weighted average balance of interest bearing investments held as a result of cash paid for the acquisition of continuous computing coupled with a decline in the average yield on investments due to a more conservative investment strategy 
in  other income expense  net increased million to million of income from expense of million in as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar usd against currencies of our non usd functional currency subsidiaries 
specifically  as a result of our acquisition of continuous computing  we now have exposure to the indian rupee inr  which  as a result of weakening against the usd  gave rise to a substantial portion of the gain recognized in other income expense in in the fourth quarter of  we entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the inr to limit our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the inr and usd 
in  interest income decreased million to million from million in interest income decreased largely as a result of our sales of ars investments upon execution of our settlement right with ubs ag 
income tax provision we recorded a tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and december  we recorded a tax expense of million for the year ended december  our current effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance provided against our us net deferred tax assets and the canadian scientific research and experimental development expenditures claim 
in addition to the aforementioned items  the effective tax rate for differs from the statutory rate due to a partial release of our valuation allowance provided against its us net deferred tax assets as a result of the purchase of continuous computing 
purchase accounting includes the establishment of a deferred tax liability due to the book tax basis differences related to specifically identified non goodwill intangibles resulting from the acquisition 
the net deferred tax liability from the acquisition created an additional source of income to utilize our deferred tax assets which resulted in a reduction of our valuation allowance 
as such  due to this additional source of income an income tax benefit of million was recognized upon the partial valuation allowance release 
at december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
we had valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  which represents a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
based on our review of all positive and negative evidence  including a three year us cumulative pre tax loss and taxable loss  it was concluded that a full valuation allowance should be recorded against our us net deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our foreign net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize all or a portion of the us net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the balance of the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  as of december  will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign countries  and on occasion  we have been subject to corporate income tax audits 
in determining the amount of income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we have evaluated whether certain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained by taxing authorities 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that may result from examination 
to the extent the ultimate outcome of an examination differs from the amounts provided for as uncertain tax positions either additional expense or benefit will be recognized in the period in which the examination is effectively settled 
during an internal revenue service irs examination was effectively settled when we agreed to a notice of proposed adjustment that was issued by the irs 
the proposed adjustment was provided in full as an uncertain tax position at december  the canada revenue agency cra completed an examination of our tax years through during the three months ended september  we agreed to the proposed adjustments and effectively settled the examination during the effective settlement did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we are currently under tax examination in india 
the periods covered under examination are the financial years through the examination is in various stages of appellate proceedings and all material uncertain tax positions associated with the examination have been taken into account in the ending balance of the unrecognized tax benefits at december  we are not under examination by tax authorities in any other jurisdictions

in addition  if certain fundamental changes occur  we may be required in certain circumstances to increase the conversion rate for any convertible senior notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of our common stock 
the convertible senior notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to our future subordinated debt 
our obligations under the convertible senior notes are not guaranteed by  and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing such debt 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes  we entered into a capped call transaction with a hedge counterparty 
the capped call transaction is expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the capped call transaction of approximately 
the strike price of the capped call transaction corresponds to the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes and is subject to certain adjustments similar to those contained in the notes 
the capped call transaction provides for net share settlement in the event that the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the settlement date exceeds the strike price of approximately per share 
in such event  the hedge counterparty would deliver to us a number of shares equal to a formula determined by the quotient resulting from a the shares being settled times the difference between the volume weighted average price on the settlement date and the strike price of approximately per share  divided by b the volume weighted average price on the settlement date 
if the volume weighted average price on the settlement date equals or exceeds the cap price of per share  the difference in a would be minus  or 
because the maximum number of shares deliverable under the capped call transaction is less than the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible senior notes  we refer to this effect as dilution mitigation 
if the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction of  as measured under the terms of the capped call transaction  no additional shares would be delivered under the capped call transaction  and correspondingly  the dilution mitigation under the capped call transaction will be limited  which means that there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped call transaction 
although the capped call transaction covers approximately million shares  in order to facilitate an orderly settlement process  the shares are divided into tranches of approximately  shares each  settling on the twenty consecutive trading days prior to the date of maturity of our convertible notes 
thus  on each settlement date  approximately  shares would be settled  assuming a volume weighted average price on such settlement date of 
assuming volume weighted average price of  the hedge counterparty would deliver to us approximately  shares on each settlement date  calculated as follows  x we were advised by the hedge counterparty that  in order to hedge or manage its risk of having to deliver shares under the capped call transaction  depending on whether our stock price rises or falls  the counterparty may purchase our common stock in the open market or enter into derivative transactions equivalent to purchasing our stock in which case its derivative counterparty would be expected to purchase common stock or accomplish the equivalent in derivative transactions and or may sell our common stock  enter into derivative transactions equivalent to selling our stock or unwind that is  cancel upon payment of agreed consideration previous derivative transactions which would be the equivalent of selling our common stock 
these types of transactions are commonly referred to as modifying hedge positions 
such modifications to our counterparty s hedge positions may have an effect on our stock price 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes  with associated unamortized issuance costs of  we repurchased the notes in the open market for million and recorded a net gain of as of december  and  we had outstanding convertible senior notes with a face value of million and million 
as of december  and  the fair value of our convertible senior notes was million and million 
derivatives we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the canadian dollar and indian rupee to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange risks where natural hedging strategies could not be effectively employed 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the purpose of our hedging activities is to reduce the risk that the eventual cash flows of the underlying assets  liabilities and firm commitments will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in general  our hedging activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose us to credit related losses in the event of non performance 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities because the counterparties are all large financial institutions with high credit ratings 
all derivatives  including foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
unrealized gain positions are recorded as other current assets and unrealized loss positions are recorded as other current liabilities 
changes in the fair values of the outstanding derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until net income loss is affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged transaction 
typically  hedge ineffectiveness could result when the amount of our hedge contracts exceed our forecasted or actual transactions for which the hedge contracts were designed to hedge 
once a hedge contract matures the associated gain loss on the contract will remain in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income loss  at which time the gain loss will be recorded to the expense line item being hedged  which is primarily r d 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward foreign currency exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
if anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions change significantly  we would reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income loss to other income expense during the quarter in which the changes occur 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect of such on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total thereafter operating leases capital leases purchase obligations a contingent consideration b convertible senior notes interest on convertible senior notes total a purchase obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
these purchase obligations are entered into in the ordinary course of business and are expected to be funded by cash flows from continuing operations 
b contingent consideration reflects the earn out payments we agreed to pay in connection with the acquisition of continuous computing 
the amounts are based on forecasted revenues at december  and will change based on the actual revenues at each payout date 
see note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the contingent consideration 
in addition to the above  we have approximately million associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make any cash payments required to settle these liabilities  but do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any activity involving special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing 
shelf registration statement on october   we filed an unallocated shelf registration statement on form s for the offering from time to time of up to million in securities consisting of common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants  debt securities or units consisting of one or more of these securities 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective on november   and it will expire in november except as may be stated in a prospectus supplement for any particular offering  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities for general corporate purposes  which may include acquiring companies in our industry and related businesses  repaying existing debt  providing additional working capital and procuring capital assets 
liquidity outlook at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  the cash generated from operations and our line of credit facility will satisfy our short and long term expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  stock repurchases  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing business operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation we record the inventory valuation allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our inventory valuation allowances establish a new cost basis for inventory 
factors influencing the provision include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  regulatory requirements affecting components  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for inventory reserves may be required 
our estimate for the allowance is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have material levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current provision for the inventory reserves may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally or months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
accrued warranty reserves are included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
long lived assets our long lived assets include definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of our definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million and million 
intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses  trade names and customer lists 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from six months to ten years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and other physical assets owned by us 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when a condition would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when a condition has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
income taxes income tax accounting requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or portion of the asset will not be realized due to inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the relevant period to utilize the deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
all future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a benefit in the period recognized 
we evaluate liabilities for estimated tax exposures in all of its operational jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria that allow financial statement benefits to be recognized only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon tax audit  administrative appeals or final court determination 
the liabilities are reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
changes to our assumptions could cause it to find a revision of past estimates appropriate 
such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our largest customer 
if one of our large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay the amounts due to us  the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and  there were no significant account balances reserved 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers 
this non specific bad debt reserve is calculated based on the company s historical pattern of bad debt write offs as a percentage of annual revenues  which percentage is then applied to the current rolling four quarter s revenue 
accrued restructuring because we have a history of paying severance benefits  expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring and acquisition related charges  net in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition multiple element arrangements a significant portion of our revenue relates to product sales for which revenue is recognized upon shipment  with limited judgment required related to product returns 
most product sales are shipped fob shipping point 
the software elements included in certain components of atca systems and media server products is considered to be functioning together with the non software elements to provide the tangible product s essential functionality and these arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as software upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis 
arrangements that include multiple elements require significant management judgment to evaluate the effective terms of agreements  our performance commitments and determination of fair value of the various deliverables under the arrangement 
during the first quarter of we elected early adoption of asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu and asu no 
 certain arrangements that include software elements  amendments to fasb asc topic  software asu 
adoption of asu and asu allows us to meet separation criteria required for multiple element arrangements where we could not previously establish a fair value for one or more of the relevant deliverables 
previously  when we could not establish fair value for certain technical support agreements all revenue was deferred 
these revenues were then recognized over the appropriate period  generally coinciding with an explicit or implied support period  or in some cases until all elements of the arrangement had been delivered 
under asu  overall consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value 
this will result in the ability to recognize each unit of accounting upon delivery 
revenue for hardware  which includes software that is considered more than incidental  will be recognized upon delivery whereas technical support services will be recognized over the applicable service period 
asu provides a fair value hierarchy in order to determine the appropriate relative fair value for each element of an arrangement 
when available  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to determine the estimated selling price 
in the absence of vsoe or third party evidence tpe for a delivered element  we then use an estimated selling price in order to determine fair value 
estimated selling prices represent our best estimate of the price at which it would transact if the deliverables were sold on a standalone basis 
for technical support services  we generally determine our selling price based on vsoe as supported by substantive renewal rates in the related service agreements 
in certain instances where vsoe cannot be established  we then rely upon the estimated selling price for such deliverables as tpe is generally not available due to the unique company specific terms surrounding such service agreements 
in establishing an appropriate estimated selling price for these technical support agreements  we considered entity specific factors such as its historical and projected costs  historical and projected revenues  and profit objectives 
we also considered market specific factors when establishing reasonable profit objectives 
for the years ended december  in thousands hardware software royalties and licenses technical support services engineering and other services total revenues hardware revenue from hardware products is recognized in accordance with asc revenue recognition 
under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights as well as for price protection rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
the software elements included in certain components of atca systems and media server products are considered to be functioning together with the non software elements to provide the tangible product s essential functionality and our atca arrangements generally include multiple elements such as hardware  technical support services as well as specified software upgrades or enhancements 
as such  the revenue associated with these products is recognized in accordance with applicable gaap for revenue recognition 
software royalties and licenses revenue from software royalties and licenses is recognized in accordance with asc software 
revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided that the revenue recognition criteria have been met and vsoe exists to allocate the total fee to all undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we defer revenue on arrangements including specified software upgrades until the specified upgrade has been delivered 
technical support services technical support services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contract in accordance with applicable gaap for revenue recognition 
the fair value of our post contract support has been determined by renewal rates within our support agreements  the actual amounts charged to customers for renewal of their support services or based on an estimated selling price 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered or as services are performed under the percentage of completion method when we are reasonably able to estimate the total effort required to complete the contract 
deferred income deferred income represents amounts received or billed for the following types of transactions distributor sales certain sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor or return privileges and price protection rights terminate  at which time related estimated distributor resale revenue  estimated effects of distributor price adjustments  and estimated costs are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
our revenue reporting for these distributors is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues  deferred income on sales to distributors  and net income 
undelivered elements of an arrangement certain arrangements include specified software upgrades and enhancements to an existing product 
revenue for such arrangements is deferred until the future obligation is fulfilled 
technical support services we have a number of technical support agreements with our customers for hardware and software maintenance 
generally  these services are billed in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period 
for ltip awards the requisite service period is equal to the period of time over which performance objectives underlying the award are expected to be achieved 
the number of ltip shares that vest depends on the achievement of certain performance criteria over the measurement period 
quarterly  we reevaluate the period which the performance objective will be met and the number of ltip shares expected to vest 
the amount of expense recorded each period for ltip awards is based on our estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plans using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates several highly subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and interest rates 
in reaching our determination of expected volatility  we use the historic volatility of our shares of common stock 
we base the expected term of our stock options on historic experience 
the expected term for purchase rights under our employee stock plans is based on the month offering period 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option or share 
the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected term of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considers the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact the results of operations in the event such changes are made 
in addition  if we were to modify any awards  additional charges would be taken 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
contingent consideration contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date based upon the estimated fair value of the contingent payment for all acquisitions 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with any adjustments in fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  that amends some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
this asu states that the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise are only relevant when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and prohibits the grouping of financial instruments for purposes of determining their fair values when the unit of account is specified in other guidance 
the provisions of this asu will be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income 
asu requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the provisions of this asu will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early application permitted 
the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  however it will change the manner in which the company presents comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other that will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations  however it will change the manner in which we assess goodwill for impairment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the canadian dollar  euro  chinese yuan  indian rupee  japanese yen  malaysian ringgit  new shekel and british pound sterling 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
based on our policy  we have established a foreign currency exposure management program which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures 
in order to reduce the potentially adverse effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts 
these hedging transactions limit our exposure to changes in the us dollar to the canadian dollar and indian rupee exchange rates  and as of december  the total notional or contractual value of the contracts we held was million 
these contracts will mature over the next two years 
holding other variables constant  a adverse fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would require an adjustment of million and increase our canadian dollar hedge liability as of december   to million 
a favorable fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would require an adjustment of million  reversing our canadian dollar hedge liability and creating a hedge asset as of december   in the amount of million 
we do not expect a fluctuation to have any impact on our operating results as the underlying hedged transactions will move in an equal and opposite direction 
if there is an unfavorable movement in the canadian dollar relative to our hedged positions this would be offset by reduced expenses  after conversion to the us dollar  associated with obligations paid for in the canadian dollar 
holding other variables constant  a adverse fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the indian rupee would require an adjustment of million and increase our indian rupee hedge liability as of december   to million 
a favorable fluctuation  in relation to our hedge positions  of the us dollar relative to the indian rupee would result in an adjustment of million  reversing our indian rupee hedge liability and creating a hedge asset as december   in the amount of million 
we do not expect a fluctuation to have any impact on our operating results as the underlying hedged transactions will move in an equal and opposite direction 
if there is an unfavorable movement in the indian rupee relative to our hedged positions this would be offset by reduced expenses  after conversion to the us dollar  associated with obligations paid for in the indian rupee 
convertible notes 
the fair value of the convertible senior notes is sensitive to interest rate changes as well as changes in our stock price 
interest rate changes would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible senior notes due to differences between market interest rates and rates in effect at the inception of the obligation 
fluctuations in our stock price would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the convertible senior notes due to the value of the notes derived from the conversion feature 
unless we elect to repurchase our convertible senior notes in the open market  changes in the fair value of the convertible senior notes have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of the convertible senior notes was million at december
