the contract manufacturing operations benefitted from improved operating costs 
management of both the contract manufacturing and business imaging operations remain focused on increasing sales  reducing costs and continuing to improve profitability  although there can be no assurances that management will be able to do so

interest expense decreased slightly by  in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax benefit was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the income tax benefit represents a net operating loss carryforward that the company expects to realize in the future as deferred tax liabilities reverse 
basic and diluted net loss per share was for fiscal compared to for fiscal selected quarterly financial data not required for a smaller reporting company 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operations were million for fiscal compared to cash used in operations of million for fiscal inventories increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily related to planned build ups and longer lead times in the supply chain 
accounts receivable increased million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter 
accounts payable increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  largely due to an increase in the volume of raw materials purchased 
depreciation was million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company s working capital position for the years ended september  and was and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal contract manufacturing spent approximately million on capital expenditures and obtained million in proceeds from the disposal of assets during fiscal in june   the company entered into a long term note for the purchase of a second color press for million  previously accounted for as an operating lease 
the note  which has a five year term  bears interest at a rate of per annum with payments  including principal and interest  of approximately  per month 
the note is collateralized by the press 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal consisting of million related to the company borrowing under its revolving credit line to fund a portion of its increased working capital and equipment needs and million related to principal payments of the note payable mentioned above 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  consisting of million related to the company borrowing under its revolving credit line and million used to make principal payments on the note payable 
the company s primary need for capital resources is to finance inventories  accounts receivable  and capital expenditures 
at september   cash recorded on the balance sheet was  the contract manufacturing segment s sales are made pursuant to project specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with multi year terms 
sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases 
the company has contracts for both printing and contract manufacturing 
one of these contract customers  a multinational consumer products company  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and of total sales in fiscal the current contract with this customer expires march  the company is currently negotiating renewal terms with this customer 
there can be no assurance that the contract will be renewed 
another multinational consumer products company accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal and in fiscal the current contract with this customer has been extended until june however  because the company s contract revenue agreements described above generally do not have minimum purchase requirements  the revenues attributable to the contracts are subject to normal business fluctuations 
on july   the company amended its credit agreement to extend its maturity date to june  and modified the required levels of after tax net income or loss under its financial covenants for fiscal years and however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain such specified minimum levels of after tax net income in such years 
the amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit facility was increased to million subject to borrowing base limitations as defined in the agreement 
the amendment also limits capital expenditures as defined in the agreement 
the company s revolving line of credit is classified as a current liability on the accompanying balance sheets because provisions in the credit agreement include deposit account requirements and a material adverse effect covenant which is subjective in nature 
it is also the company s policy to classify borrowings under the revolving line of credit as current based on how it manages working capital 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 
the company is required to pay a non usage fee of 
per annum on the unused portion of the facility 
on april   the company entered into a commercial security agreement in favor of the lender to secure obligations under the first amended and restated credit agreement

table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued the company had approximately million available under the million revolving line of credit facility as of september  as of september   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the credit agreement 
consistent with the sales concentration previously discussed  amounts due from two multinational consumer products customers represent and of total accounts receivable at september  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s operating cash flow  together with amounts available under its credit agreement  are adequate to service the company s current obligations as of september   assuming the company is able to extend or refinance its credit agreement upon expiration 
the company intends to retain earnings to finance future operations and expansion and does not expect to pay any dividends within the foreseeable future 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  the company s primary lenders must approve the payment of any dividends over million 
inflation in fiscal years and  the impact of inflation was minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
management believes that the company is generally successful in passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the company s products  although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases 
prior to these periods  the impact of inflation has been minimal on the company s inventory and operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of operations for the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
accounts receivable management estimates allowances for collectability related to its accounts receivable balances 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectable 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectability of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectability of its receivables or future revenues 
recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
credit terms to customers in the contract manufacturing segment are generally net days 
credit terms to customers in the business imaging segment are generally discounted net terms 
management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
goodwill the company tests goodwill annually at the reporting unit level for impairment as of july the operating segments herein also represent the company s reporting units for goodwill purposes 
the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate reporting unit fair values and also considers multiples of relevant companies 
in determining the fair values of the reporting units  the company was required to make certain assumptions and cannot predict what future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of its goodwill 
management completed the company s annual impairment test and determined there were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit at july  however  there can be no assurance that valuation multiples will not decline  growth rates will not be lower than expected  discount rates will not increase  or the projected cash flows of the individual reporting units will not decline 
the company prepared the discounted cash flow analysis in the same manner as in prior years 
the company further updated all significant assumptions in light of current market and regulatory conditions 
the key assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow analysis were projected cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and expected long term growth rates 
because each of the reporting units has distinct characteristics  the company developed these assumptions separately 
any variance in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the evaluation of goodwill impairment 
these assumptions included the company s actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections and market data  as well as estimates by its management regarding future cash flows and operating results 
for example  lower than expected growth or margins or an increase to the discount rate due to changes in risk premiums or other factors may suggest that an impairment has occurred under step and require the company to proceed to step to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities of the reporting units 

table of contents critical accounting estimates continued to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  the company applied a discount rate of in the measurement compared to a discount rate of in the measurement 
the change in the discount rate is caused by  amongst other things  an increase in the estimated risk premium to provide for uncertainty in the long term cash flows of the business 
management believes it has been difficult in recent years to accurately predict business performance for the reporting units due to industry conditions 
in the contract manufacturing business  cyclical economic conditions have impacted demand for branded consumer products 
in the business imaging business  volatility in paper costs experienced by the converting industry has been unfavorable to historical operating results 
to improve profit margins  management believes it has implemented business plans related to growth  pricing  product mix and cost reduction strategies 
management notes that recent operating results have improved and it expects the business initiatives it has implemented to continue to have a favorable impact on operating results 
management believes the estimated risk premiums give reasonable consideration to both the historical results as well as recent performance 
if the improved business performance is not sustained as expected  the projected cash flows may not be sufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  and an impairment of goodwill will likely occur 
as part of its review  management considers the sensitivity of the discount rate  and notes that using its current growth assumptions  the maximum discount rate that allows contract manufacturing to pass step is  and the maximum discount rate that allows business imaging to pass step is 
in addition  the company is in the process of implementing a labor efficiency plan in business imaging 
including these cost reductions  the maximum discount rate that allows business imaging to pass step is 
the company recognizes that its common stock regularly trades below book value per share and will continue to monitor the relationship of its market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value 
while management plans to return the company s business fundamentals to levels that support the book value per share  there is no assurance that the plan will be successful  or that the market price of the common stock will increase to such levels in the foreseeable future 
during fiscal year  the company changed its annual goodwill measurement date from june to july the assessment was performed as of june  and an updated assessment was performed as of july  the assessment included comparing the carrying amount of net assets of each reporting unit to its respective implied fair value as of each date 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment for disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates the recoverability of the recorded amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset group are less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the company determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due  if any  plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences that will either be deductible or taxable when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets will include recognition of operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
when applicable  valuation allowances are recognized to limit recognition of deferred tax assets where appropriate 
such allowances may be reversed when circumstances provide evidence that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of september  based on its evaluation of the available evidence  which includes consideration of reversal patterns for long term deferred tax liabilities and the expected taxable income generated in future periods 
the assessment of a valuation allowance is an estimate and changes in future taxable income or loss can result in change in the assessment of a valuation allowance 
in addition  if net operating loss carryforwards will not reverse and be realized over the same long term period as the difference primarily for depreciation on property and equipment  a change in the assessment of a valuation allowance could occur 
additional information on the company s accounting policies is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report as referenced to the appendix to this report 
recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount qualitative assessment 
if it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an entity would not be required to perform the existing two step impairment test 
the amendments to topic are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements
