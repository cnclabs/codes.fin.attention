item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
overview we are a company with limited liability incorporated in under the laws of the cayman islands 
headquartered in beijing  we provide products and services to oil and gas companies and their affiliates through our domestic companies 
as the company contractually controlling the domestic companies  we are the center of strategic management  financial control and human resources allocation 
our business is mainly focused on the upstream sectors of the oil and gas industry 
we derive our revenues from the sales and provision of hardware products  software products  and services 
our products and services involve most of the key procedures of the extraction and production of oil and gas  and include automation systems  equipment  tools and on site technical services 
our vies provide the oil and gas industry with equipment  production technologies  automation and services to enhance our customers efficiency 
nanjing recon nanjing recon is a high tech company that specializes in automation services for oilfield companies 
it mainly focuses on providing automation solutions to the oil exploration industry  including monitoring wells  automatic metering to the joint station production  process monitor  and a variety of oilfield equipment and control systems 
bhd bhd is a high tech company that specializes in transportation equipment and stimulation productions and services 
possessing proprietary patents and substantial industry experience  bhd has built up stable and strong working relationships with the major oilfields in china 
business outlook the oilfield engineering and technical service industry is generally divided into five sections exploration  drilling and completion  testing and logging  production and oilfield construction 
our businesses have mainly focused on production processes 
as of this year  we are also expanding our business to well completion and horizontal well down hole service process 
we still believe that many existing oil wells and oilfields are in need of renewal and improvement on their current equipment to maintain production 
we also believe that as many new wells are developed  our gathering and transferring equipment will be in great need 
accordingly  in the next year  we will focus on the following areas 
measuring equipment and service 
digital oil field and the management of oil companies are highly regarded 
we believe our oilfield supervisory control and data acquisition scada and related technical support services will address the needs of the oil well automation system market  for which we forecast strong needs in the short term 
through early cooperation with cnpc on turkmenistan  we have developed our experience in this market 
although bidding has not yet commenced  we will continue pursuing overseas business projects in the coming second phase construction 
gathering and transferring equipment 
with more new wells developed  our management anticipates that demand for our furnaces and burners will grow more compared to last year  especially in the tuha oilfield and xinjiang oilfield 
fracturing service 
we believe we cooperated well with zhongyuan oilfield in and expect to continue growing revenue from fracturing and related stimulation services in the coming year 
new product line 
design and development of down hole tools has always been an important technique for oilfield companies 
recently  this market has developed very rapidly 
after a year test project for our client  we have developed experience with this technology and our products and servers have been accepted by our client 
we expect revenue from this business in the coming year 
in addition to our business development  our management will monitor our cash flows very closely to make sure our company can meet our short term obligations and to balance business development with our capital requirements 
recent industry developments despite uncertainty in the energy industry related to such matters as fluctuating prices and future opportunities for oil companies  our management believes there are still many factors to support our long term development the opening of the chinese oil industry to participation by non state owned service providers and vendors played an increasingly important role in the high end oilfield service segment to allow competition based on efficiency and price 
as oil and gas fields are depleted  it becomes more challenging to find and convert reserves into usable energy sources 
as the industry has permitted competition by private companies and oil companies have formed separate service companies  high tech service has gradually opened up to private companies 
speeding up the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources such as shale gas and coal bed methane will bring more requirements of related technic and service 
china is rich in unconventional hydrocarbon resources  but new exploration and development technology breakthroughs are urgently needed  and overseas assets of chinese oilfield companies increased gradually  and they will provide more opportunity for domestic service companies to participate in foreign projects 
management is focus on these factors and will seek to extend our business on the industrial chain  like providing more integrated services and incremental measures and growing our business from a predominantly up ground business to include some down hole services as well 
growth strategy as a smaller local company  it is our basic strategy to focus on developing our onshore oilfield business  ie the upstream of the industry 
due to the remote location and difficult environment of china s oil and gas fields  foreign competitors rarely enter those fields 
large domestic oil companies prefer to focus on their exploration and development businesses to earn higher margins and keep their competitive advantage 
with regard to private oilfield service companies  specialize in the manufacture of drilling and production equipment 
thus  the market for technical support and project service is still in its early stage 
our management focuses on providing high quality products and service at oilfields where we have a geographical advantage 
such strategy allows us to avoid conflicts of interest with bigger suppliers of drilling equipment and keep our leading position within the market segment 
our mission is to increase the automation and safety levels of industrial petroleum production in china  and improve its efficiency and effectiveness through advanced technologies 
at the same time  we are always looking to improve our business and to increase our earning capability 
factors affecting our results of operations our operating results in any period are subject to the general conditions typically affecting the chinese oilfield service industry including the amount of spending by our customers  primarily those in the oil and gas industry  growing demand from large corporations for improved management and software designed to enhance corporate performance  the procurement processes of our customers  especially those in the oil and gas industry  competition and related pricing pressure from other oilfield service solution providers  especially those targeting the oil and gas industry in china  the ongoing development of the oilfield service market in china  and inflation and other factors 
unfavorable changes in any of these general conditions could negatively affect the number and size of the projects we undertake  the number of products we sell  the amount of services we provide  the price of our products and services or otherwise affect our results of operations 
our operating results in any period are more directly affected by company specific factors including our continued ability to lead and to control all affiliated entities  our revenue growth  the proportion of our business dedicated to large companies  our ability to successfully develop  introduce and market new solutions and services  our ability to increase our revenues from customers both old and new in the oil and gas industry in china  our ability to effectively manage our operating costs and expenses  and our ability to effectively implement any targeted acquisitions and or strategic alliances so as to provide efficient access to the markets in the oil and gas industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates and assumptions we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information  our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made  and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant accounting estimates 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other disclosures included in this quarterly report 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our company s consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and useful lives of property and equipment 
consolidation of vies we recognize an entity as a vie if it either i has insufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or ii has equity investors who lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
we consolidate a vie as its primary beneficiary when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
assets recognized as a result of consolidating vies do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets 
conversely  liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these vies do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery does not occur until products have been shipped or services have been provided to the client and the client has signed a completion and acceptance report  risk of loss has transferred to the client  client acceptance provisions have lapsed  or the company has objective evidence that the criteria specified in client acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
the sales price is not considered to be fixed or determinable until all contingencies related to the sale have been resolved 
hardware revenue from hardware sales is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are no unfulfilled company obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the arrangement 
software the company sells self developed software 
for software sales  the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification  topic  software revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
revenue from software is recognized according to project contracts 
contract costs are accumulated during the periods of installation and testing or commissioning 
usually this is short term 
revenue is not recognized until completion of the contracts and receipt of acceptance statements 
services the company provides services to improve software functions and system requirements on separated fixed price contracts 
revenue is recognized when services are completed and acceptance is determined by a completion report signed by the customer 
deferred income represents unearned amounts billed to customers related to sales contracts 
cost of revenues when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met  costs incurred are recognized as cost of revenue 
cost of revenues includes wages  materials  handling charges  the cost of purchased equipment and pipes  and other expenses associated with manufactured products and services provided to customers 
we expect cost of revenues to grow as our revenues grow 
it is possible that we could incur development costs with little revenue recognition  but based upon our past history  we expect our revenues to grow 
fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for trade accounts receivable  other receivables  advances to suppliers  trade accounts payable  accrued liabilities  advances from customers and notes payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short term maturity of these financial instruments 
long term other receivables approximate fair value because the interest rate approximates the market rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables and other receivable accounts are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method  less a provision made for impairment of these receivables 
provisions are applied to trade and other receivables where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the balance may not be collectible 
the identification of doubtful accounts requires the use of judgment and estimates of management 
our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for trade accounts receivable was   and  on june  and  respectively 
specifically  allowance for trade accounts receivable related parties on june  and was   and  respectively 
allowance for other receivables on june  and was   and  respectively 
there was no allowance for other receivables from related parties 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable 
when such an event occurs  we project undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition over the remaining life of the asset 
if projections indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset will not be recovered  we reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the projected discounted cash flows 
in the past  we have not had to make significant adjustments to the carrying values of our long lived assets  and we do not anticipate a need to do so in the future 
however  circumstances could cause us to have to reduce the value of our capitalized software more rapidly than we have in the past if our revenues were to significantly decline 
estimated cash flows from the use of the long lived assets are highly uncertain and therefore the estimation of the need to impair these assets is reasonably likely to change in the future 
should the economy or the acceptance of our software change in the future  it is likely that our estimate of the future cash flows from the use of these assets will change by a material amount 
results of operations the following consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of the company and its variable interest entities vies  bhd  nanjing recon and eni as to eni  from july  to december  only 
the results of operations are those of the vies 
on december   eni changed its equity ownership 
we ceased to have the power to direct the activities of eni that most significantly impact its economic performance as of that date 
as a result of the company s determination to deconsolidate eni  eni s results of operations have been consolidated in the company s results of operations only through december  our historical reporting results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
revenue for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change hardware    service   software    total revenues    revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended june  were   an increase of  or from  for the year ended june  this was mainly caused by deconsolidation of eni 
for the year ended june   there was no revenue contributed by eni while that contribution of eni was  for the year ended june  in light of the ownership change of eni on december   the company s audit committee concluded that eni is no longer a vie and the company should not include eni s operations in the company s operating results starting december  after eliminating that factor  our revenue from operations increased about  or 
when results from eni are included in operations for the period in fiscal year before it was deconsolidated  the increase from to revenue from operations is more moderate 
recently developed horizontal fracturing business 
during this year  recon bhd signed several contracts with an aggregate contract value of rmb million with sinopec zhongyuan oilfield 
as of june   we completed about half of the contracts and recognized a corresponding percentage of revenues from the contracts  overseas project 
during this year  we also entered into the overseas market by following cnpc 
we won a major contract of approximately  with cnpc sichuan petroleum administration bureau to provide it with the emerson pcs sis systems in its south yolotan gas field m a project located in turkmenistan 
as of june   we had provided that equipment and recognized approximately  of the contract amount as revenue in cost and margin for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change total revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    margin cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues includes raw materials and costs related to design  implementation  delivery and maintenance of products and services 
all materials and components we need can be purchased or manufactured under contracts 
usually the prices of electronic components do not fluctuate dramatically due to market competition and will not significantly affect our cost of revenues 
however  specialized equipment and incentive chemical products may be directly influenced by the price moves of metal and oil 
additionally  the prices of some imported accessories mandated by our clients can also impact our cost 
our cost of revenues increased by  or  from  in the year ended june  to   for the same period in costs of operations increased by  or  which were mainly due to increase of new projects  and the decrease of costs was mainly due to the deconsolidation of eni  which accounted for  
as a percentage of revenues  our cost of remained stable at in the year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year because most of our new vendors are international companies and our clients require us to import their relatively expensive products  our cost of operations is relatively high 
oil and gas production is a dangerous process  so right now domestic oil companies prefer to use more well known mature products 
they have begun to implement import substitution strategies by using more domestic self developed products 
we are cooperating with our clients on this so that we can decrease our cost in the long run 
gross profit 
for the year ended june   our gross profit increased to   from  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
for the year ended june   our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was stable at  compared to for the year of our management believes that a higher margin level is very important to secure our business 
the domestic oilfield service industry in china is becoming more and more competitive 
as a small company  we are now switching our role from being a primary products supplier to becoming an advanced products and services integrator so that we can make full use of our knowledge and rich experience in the oilfields production to satisfy our clients needs 
with further exploration and development of oilfields  the level of reserved crude oil gradually decreases  as does the output 
a company  which can provide more effective service and safe products to help increase oil well recovery efficiency  will earn higher profit and keep greater flexibility in managing its business 
management believes that specializing in providing packaged customized solutions will increase our long term competitiveness 
expenses for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change selling and distribution expenses   of revenue general and administrative expenses   of revenue operating expenses    selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenditures of our sales and marketing department  sales commissions  costs of our marketing programs such as public relations  advertising and trade shows  and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
selling expenses decreased by  or  from  for the year ended june  to   for the same period of as a result of focusing our selling efforts on a more limited number of clients 
the percentage of selling expenses in revenue decreased from to 
our management believes the selling and distribution expenses are reasonable and expect selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain around of our revenue in the long run 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs from our human resources organization  facilities costs  provision for bad debt  depreciation expenses  professional advisor fees  audit fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  from  in the year ended june  to   for the same period of of the decrease  it was mainly caused by the deconsolidation of eni  offset by the following operational general and administrative expenses increased expenses related to research and development activities  increased salaries by our vies to attract talent  increased allowance for accounts receivable and increased expenses related to sox compliance services 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues for the year ended june  and of total revenues for the same period in overall  this percentage is high and our management will focus on this issue and take steps to reduce these expenses 
net income for the years ended june  increase percentage decrease change loss from operations    interest income     interest expense and foreign currency adjustments  other income loss    subsidy income    loss on deconsolidation   loss before income taxes    benefit from provision for income taxes   net income attributable to non controlling interest  net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders  loss from operations 
loss from operations was   for the year ended june   compared to loss from operations of  for the same period of  as a result of deconsolidation of eni  increasing revenues and reducing expenses during this year 
subsidy income 
we received grants of  and   from the local government for the years ended june  and  respectively 
these grants were given by the government in the form of income tax return to support local companies in developing advanced technologies and improving their products 
loss on deconsolidation 
as a result of the deconsolidation of eni  we suffered a loss of   for the year ended june   which amount was measured as the difference between a the aggregate of i the fair value of any consideration received  ii the fair value of the retained non controlling investment in eni at the date in which eni was deconsolidated  and iii the carrying amount of any non controlling interest in eni  and b the carrying value of the net assets and liabilities of eni as of december  our management believes it was an unusual and infrequent loss and we took steps to prevent this from happening in the future by monitoring our vies operation very closely 
income tax expense 
income taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is not likely that the asset will be realized 
we have not been subject to any income taxes in the united states or the cayman islands 
enterprises doing business in prc are generally subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of  however  nanjing recon and bhd were granted certifications of high technology enterprise and are taxed at a rate of for taxable income generated 
the applicable tax rate for each of our subsidiaries changed in the past few years because of their qualifications and different local policies 
for calendar years and  nanjing recon and bhd were taxed at a rate of and eni was taxed at 
our effective eit burden will vary  depending on which of our domestic companies generate greater revenues 
income tax expense for the years ended june  was  and income tax benefit for the year ended june  was   respectively 
this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in taxable operating income 
net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
our company has improved the operations by increasing revenue by obtaining new customers and reducing expenses by focusing on big clients so that our selling expenses were decreased 
as a result  net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was improved by  or for the year ended june   from a net loss of  for the same year ended june  for the years ended june  increase percentage adjusted ebitda rmb rmb decrease change us dollars reconciliation of adjusted ebitda from net loss net loss    income tax expense benefit    interest expense and foreign currency adjustment  stock compensation expense    depreciation and amortization    loss on deconsolidation   adjusted ebitda    adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before income tax expense  interest expense  non cash stock compensation expense  and depreciation  amortization expense 
we believe it is useful to an equity investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used by investors in our industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense  depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods  the book value of assets  the capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired  and it helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
adjusted ebitda improved by  or  to a loss of   for the year ended june  compared to the same year ended june  this was mainly due to our improved operations 
compared to the decrease in net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders  we believe ebitda more accurately reflects our operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash on hand  demand deposits and highly liquid short term debt investments with stated maturities of no more than six months 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of indebtedness 
as of june   except for   of short term borrowings from third parties    of short term borrowings from related parties  and   in commercial loans from two local banks  we did not have any finance leases or purchase commitments  guarantees or other material contingent liabilities 
holding company structure 
we are a holding company with no operations of our own 
all of our operations are conducted through the domestic companies 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends and to finance any debt that we may incur is dependent upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from the domestic companies 
in addition  chinese legal restrictions permit payment of dividends to us by our domestic companies only out of its accumulated net profit  if any  determined in accordance with chinese accounting standards and regulations 
under chinese law  the domestic companies are required to set aside a portion at least of their after tax net income after discharging all cumulated loss  if any  each year for compulsory statutory reserve until the amount of the reserve reaches of the domestic companies registered capital 
these funds may be distributed to shareholders at the time of wind up 
when we were incorporated in the cayman islands in august   ordinary shares were authorized  and  ordinary shares were issued to mr 
yin shenping  mr 
chen guangqiang and mr 
li hongqi  at a par value of each 
on december   our company sold  ordinary shares to an investor at an aggregate consideration of  on june   in connection with our initial public offering  the board of directors approved a to split of ordinary shares and redeemable ordinary shares to shareholders of record as of such date 
after giving effect to the share split of our ordinary shares and the completion of our initial public offering  we had  ordinary shares outstanding 
on december   in light of the change of the ownership of eni  we ceased to have the power to direct the activities of eni  which as of that date most significantly impact its economic performance 
as a result  eni ceased to be our vie starting from the same date 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as shareholders equity  or that are not reflected in our financial statements 
furthermore  we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity 
moreover  we do not have any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
capital resources 
to date we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and proceeds from the initial public offering 
as of june   we had total assets of   which includes cash amounting to   net accounts receivable from independent parties amounting to   and net accounts receivable from related parties amounting to  
working capital amounted to   and shareholders equity amounted to  
we have experienced some working capital pressures and have sought to transfer these pressures by delaying payment to our suppliers 
cash from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was   for the year ended june  this was an increase of   from  for the year ended june  specifically  the increase is mainly due to some of our new completed projects were not paid in full by the end of the year  which caused the accounts receivable to increase by approximately   and purchase advances  including related parties  increased by approximately   mainly due to performance under new and on going projects  offset by increases in accounts payable  including accounts payable related parties  by approximately   due to longer payment terms for suppliers and a decrease in inventory of approximately   due to increase in sales and therefore a greater turnover in inventory 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was   for the year ended june   a decrease of  from  for the same period of the foremost factor for the decrease was the loss of cash associated with the deconsolidation of eni for approximately   for year cash from financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities amounted to   for the year ended june   compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of  for the year ended june  during the year ended june   we borrowed   from domestic commercial banks to supplement our working capital and repaid   on bank loans when due 
working capital 
total working capital as of june  amounted to   compared to   as of june  total current assets as of june  amounted to   an increase of   compared to  at june  the increase in total current assets at june  compared to june  was mainly due to the increase in accounts receivable of  
accounts receivable increased materially as a result of increases in the total value of large projects in process by the company for a relatively limited number of clients 
current liabilities amounted to   at june   in comparison to   at june  this dramatic increase was attributable mainly to an increase of bank loans and payments to suppliers
