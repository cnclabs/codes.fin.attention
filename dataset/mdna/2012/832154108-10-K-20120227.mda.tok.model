as technology  market dynamics and consumer demands change  smith micro has proven its ability to evolve and meet those demands again and again 
during fiscal year  we experienced a significant decrease in our revenues 
this was primarily due to the introduction and market acceptance of mobile hotspot devices  tablets and smartphones capable of functioning as a wwan hotspot  resulting in lower demand in our north american marketplace for our core connection management products 
while we launched new wireless products that addressed this technology shift  they are new to the market and their rate of adoption and deployment is unknown at this time causing material uncertainty regarding the timing of our future wireless revenues 

table of contents as a result of our decreased revenues  slow adoption of our new products  operating losses and depressed stock prices  we recorded a goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charge of million in fiscal year all goodwill and intangible assets have been written off as of december  for the year ended december   revenues to three customers and their respective affiliates in the wireless business segment accounted for  and of the company s total revenues and of accounts receivable

 income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we are required to evaluate the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
the deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period generally results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations

we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
real property leases our corporate headquarters  including our principal administrative  sales and marketing  customer support and research and development facility  is located in aliso viejo  california  where we currently lease and occupy approximately  square feet of space pursuant to leases that expire on may  and january  we lease approximately  square feet in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease that expires december  we lease approximately  square feet in mountain view  california under a lease that expires february  we lease approximately  square feet in watsonville  california under a lease that expires september  internationally  we lease space in belgrade  serbia and vancouver  canada 
these leases expire in and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently report our net revenues under two operating groups wireless and productivity graphics 
within each of these groups software revenue is recognized based on the customer and contract type 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to our customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements are met 
if the requirements are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
for wireless sales  returns from customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
we also provide some technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 

table of contents we have a few multiple element agreements for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
as of january   we adopted asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements which amends revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new guidance eliminated the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  vendor objective evidence voe or third party evidence tpe is unavailable 
for most of our multiple element agreements  vsoe for all contract elements is used and the timing of the individual element revenue streams is determined and recognized as delivered 
for productivity graphics sales  management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
certain revenues are booked net of revenue sharing payments 
sales directly to end users are recognized upon shipment 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
sales incentives for our productivity graphics sales  the cost of sales incentives the company offers without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is accounted for as a reduction of revenue as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we use historical redemption rates to estimate the cost of customer incentives 
total sales incentives were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
internal software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning  designing  coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized 
through december   software has been substantially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 

table of contents in process research and development in  we capitalized million of ipr d costs related to our acquisition of core mobility in accordance with accounting standards that became effective in this ipr d project was completed during the fourth quarter of amortization commenced in the fair value of the ipr d was determined using the discounted cash flow approach 
the expected future cash flows were estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return were the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
future cash flows were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account the expected product life cycle  market penetration and growth rates 
as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we have fully impaired this asset during fiscal year as such  there will be no future amortization expense recorded for this impaired asset 
capitalized software and amortization we capitalized internally developed software and software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development had reached technological feasibility or if there were alternative future uses for the purchased software as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed 
these costs were amortized on a product by product basis  typically over an estimated life of five to seven years  using the larger of the amount calculated using the straight line method or the amount calculated using the ratio between current period gross revenues and the total of current period gross revenues and estimated future gross revenues 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluated on a product by product basis the unamortized capitalized cost of computer software compared to the net realizable value of that product 
the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceeded its net realizable value was written off 
as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we have fully impaired these assets during fiscal year as such  there will be no future amortization expense recorded for these impaired assets 
intangible assets and amortization amortization expense related to other intangibles acquired in previous acquisitions was calculated on a straight line basis over various useful lives 
as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we have fully impaired these assets as of december  as such  there will be no future amortization expense recorded for these impaired assets 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company tests goodwill and intangible assets for impairment in december of each year  or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
these assets are impaired if the company determines that their carrying values may not be recoverable based on an assessment of certain events or changes in circumstances 
table of contents a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the company recognizes the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets as an impairment loss 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the company s fair value to its net book value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the company s goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the company would recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
however  the market price of an individual equity security and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
substantial value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity 
consequently  measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity s individual equity securities 
an acquiring entity often is willing to pay more for equity securities that gives it a controlling interest than an investor would pay for a number of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest 
that control premium may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to exceed its market capitalization 
the quoted market price of an individual equity security  therefore  need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit 
at december   the company estimated the fair value in step based on the income approach which included discounted cash flows as well as a market approach that utilized the company s earnings and revenue multiples 
the company s discounted cash flows required management judgment with respect to forecasted revenues  launch of new products  operating expenses  working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the company s assessment resulted in a fair value that was marginally greater than the company s carrying values for the productivity graphics operating unit and was significantly greater than the company s carrying values for the wireless operating unit at december  in accordance with the authoritative literature  the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december  at june   the company concluded that a decline in its stock price and market capitalization was not representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
the goodwill impairment test should be based on an other than temporary decline 
the company believed that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the company s two reporting units had not declined below the reporting unit s carrying amount because there had been temporary declines in the stock price  revenues due to a technology shift in our marketplace resulting in our core connection management products experiencing lower demand in certain markets and earnings as we continued to invest heavily in r d to bring new products to market 
there are several new products that we expected to launch during the second half of that would address the technology shift in the marketplace 
as such  the company expected these new products  should they be successful  to result in improved revenues and profitability during the second half of at june   the company stated that if its revenues  profitability  and stock price did not improve in the third and or fourth quarter of  we would more likely than not have to perform step of the impairment test 
the triggering events we monitored were revenues  new product launches  profitability  and stock price 

table of contents during the period ended september   the company concluded that a sustained decline in its stock price and market capitalization was representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
the triggering events that led us to this conclusion were revenues declined for the third consecutive quarter 
new product launches although we were in trials for several of our new products  as of september  we had not realized any revenues from these new products 
profitability declined for the third consecutive quarter 
stock price had remained at depressed prices 
as such  the company performed step of the impairment test 
for both reporting units  fair value was determined by an average of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method 
for the wireless unit  the concluded fair value as of september  was approximately million and the carrying value was million which failed step and triggered step for the productivity graphics unit  the concluded fair value as of september  was approximately million and the carrying value was million which failed step and triggered step for step  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
the inputs measured at fair value used in this valuation methodology were considered level in the three tier value hierarchy per fasb asc topic no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures 
the excess if any of the carrying value of goodwill was compared to the implied fair value of goodwill and resulted in an impairment loss of million in the fiscal quarter ended september  the following table sets forth the change in the carrying amount of goodwill balances as of december  and in thousands productivity wireless graphics total balance as of december  impairment losses balance as of december  impairment or disposal of long lived assets the company assesses potential impairment to its long lived assets as required by fasb asc topic no 
 property  plant  and equipment  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the long lived assets is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
as a result of the triggering events described above in our goodwill impairment analysis  the company reviewed its long lived assets for recoverability 
as a result of this analysis  the company recognized a long lived asset impairment charge of million in the fiscal quarter ended september  which was allocated to the intangible assets of million and million to equipment and improvements  primarily related to our leasehold improvements

in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we are required to evaluate the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against its deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not realization standard 
the four sources of taxable income that must be considered in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized are future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset of gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the applicable tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a significant factor in the company s assessment is that the company is in a three year historical cumulative loss as of the end of fiscal this fact  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced the company s ability to rely on projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
after a review of the four sources of taxable income as of december  as described above  and after consideration of the company s three year cumulative loss position as of december   the company recorded a valuation allowance related to its us based deferred tax amounts  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense  of million during the year ended december  stock based compensation the company accounts for all stock based payment awards made to employees and directors based on their fair values and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight line method over the requisite service period for each award as required by fasb asc topic no

 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period

 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the amendments in this asu modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
foreign currency risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we do occasionally invoice in foreign currencies 
for the three years ended december   and  our revenues denominated in foreign currencies were million  million  and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
the operational expenses of our foreign entities reduce the currency exposure we have because our foreign currency revenues are offset in part by expenses payable in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time
