acquisitions 
in november  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of berkeley transportation systems  inc bts  a privately held company based in berkeley  california which specializes in transportation performance measurement 
on or shortly after the acquisition date  we paid a total of approximately  in cash 
additionally  we are scheduled to pay up to a total of million within months after the acquisition date pursuant to holdback  deferred payment and earn out provisions 
in january  we acquired all of the capital stock of meridian environmental technology  inc met for an initial cash payment of approximately million 
met specializes in advanced traveler information systems and offers maintenance decision support system mdss management tools that allow users to create solutions to meet roadway maintenance decision needs 
we also agreed to pay up to million on each of the first two anniversaries of the closing of the acquisition  as well as up to an additional million under a month earn out provision 
in january  we made a cash payment of approximately  of the first deferred payment to the shareholders of met and held back  in accordance with certain provisions of the purchase agreement 
we expect the contingencies related to the  holdback to be resolved sometime in the first fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ending march   at which time we may or may not release the holdback 
additionally  no amounts were earned by the met shareholders related to the first year earn out provision 
in april  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of hamilton signal  inc  which included the abacus system  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in cash 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for additional discussion on these acquisitions 
sale of vehicle sensors 
on july   we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets used in connection with our vehicle sensors segment to bendix pursuant to an asset purchase agreement signed on july  the asset sale 
upon closing  bendix paid us million in cash  subject to a million holdback and adjustments based upon the working capital of the vehicle sensors segment at closing  and bendix assumed certain specified obligations and liabilities of the vehicle sensors segment 
we are entitled to additional consideration in the form of certain performance and royalty related earn outs 
as a result of the asset sale  we no longer operate in the vehicle sensors segment 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report  for additional discussion on this transaction 
business segments 
subsequent to the asset sale  we now operate in two reportable segments roadway sensors and transportation systems 
roadway sensors the roadway sensors segment includes  among other products  our vantage  versicam  pico  vantage vector and abacus vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 

table of contents transportation systems the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 
this segment includes the operations of met  which specializes in advanced traveler information systems and offers mdss management tools that allow users to create solutions to meet roadway maintenance decision needs 
also included in this segment are the operations of bts  which specializes in transportation performance measurement 
business 
given the current ongoing uncertainties regarding global economic conditions  we continue to remain cautious about our overall business 
we believe the overall ongoing unfavorable economic environment has negatively affected  and may continue to negatively affect  our financial results for the foreseeable future  and may impair our ability to accurately forecast our future financial performance and other business trends 
in addition  since the end users of a majority of our products and services are governmental entities  we have been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by the budgetary issues and delays in purchasing decisions that many municipalities and other state and local agencies continue to face 
spending for new roadways  new systems to address traffic congestion and other transportation infrastructure improvements has been delayed or eliminated in some instances 
however  we believe the need to rebuild and modernize aging transportation infrastructure will continue  and in addition to funds available through recent federal stimulus packages and federal highway bills  there exist various other funding mechanisms that support transportation infrastructure and related projects 
these include bonds  dedicated sales and gas tax measures and other alternative funding sources 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectability of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
product revenues and related costs of sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are typically met at the time of product shipment  but in certain circumstances  may not be met until receipt or acceptance by the customer 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant obligations or uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
we recognize revenue from the sale of deliverables that are part of a multiple element arrangement in accordance with applicable accounting guidance that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy permitting the use of an estimated selling price to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration to a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement where neither vendor specific objective evidence vsoe nor third party evidence tpe of fair value is available for that deliverable 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements that have stand alone value in a multiple element arrangement  we are required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration is allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on our estimated selling prices 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software and software related services in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is determined by vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements and the only undelivered element is post contract customer support or maintenance  and vsoe of the fair value of such support or maintenance does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period 
when the 
table of contents fair value of a delivered element has not been established but vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed and are included in our net sales 
contract revenues contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
when appropriate  contract revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as contract performance progresses  and is based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
we generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred  divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
costs are generally determined from actual hours of labor effort expended 
direct non labor costs are charged as incurred plus any mark up permitted under the contract 
certain of our contract revenues are recognized as services are performed and amounts are earned  which is measured by time incurred or other contractual milestones or output measures 
contract revenues accounted for in this manner generally relate to certain cost plus fixed fee or time and materials contracts for which no specific maximum contract values are stipulated 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in contract revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates  including engineering progress  materials quantities  and achievement of milestones  incentives  penalty provisions  labor productivity  cost estimates and others 
such estimates are based on various professional judgments we make with respect to those factors and are subject to change as the project proceeds and new information becomes available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion and contract completion costs on our long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and our actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
substantially all of our contracts are of the following types cost plus fixed fee 
under cost plus fixed fee contracts  we charge our customers for our costs  including both direct and indirect costs  plus a fixed negotiated fee 
fixed price 
under fixed price contracts  our customers pay us an agreed fixed amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work 
prior to completion  our recognized profit margins on any fixed price contract depend on the accuracy of our estimates and will increase to the extent that our current estimates of aggregate actual costs are below amounts previously estimated 
conversely  if our current estimated costs exceed prior estimates  our profit margins will decrease and we may realize a loss on a project 
time and materials 
under our time and materials contracts  we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our customers based on the actual time that we spend on a project 
in addition  customers reimburse us for our actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct incidental expenditures incurred in connection with our performance under the contract 
the majority of our time and material contracts are subject to maximum contract values and  accordingly  revenues under these contracts are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectability of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general allowance based on our historical collections experience 
considerable judgment is required in assessing and estimating the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventories 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventories in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and their estimated realizable value 
these estimates are based on management s judgments and assumptions as to future demand requirements and our evaluation of market conditions 
demand for our 
table of contents products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
estimated inventory write downs  once established  are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped  so if actual market conditions are more favorable in the fiscal periods subsequent to those in which we record significant write downs  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
other long lived assets primarily represent purchased intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships  trade names and patents 
we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to seven years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used or  if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  using a straight line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we have determined that our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are identical to our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes 
in fiscal  we early adopted the new provisions issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb that are intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
this guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
we test long lived assets and purchased intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we determine whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows the asset are expected to generate 
if an asset is not recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
we primarily use the income valuation approach to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and purchased intangible assets 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which would adversely affect our product gross profit and our operating results 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  which increases our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be  while also separately considering applicable discrete and other non recurring items  and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and financial results during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which our estimates are refined so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate 
these changes  along with adjustments to our deferred taxes  among others  may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 

table of contents the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in the statements of operations as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our stock based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized over the requisite service period 
our stock based awards are currently comprised of common stock options and restricted stock units 
the fair value of our common stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing formula 
while utilizing this model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by it may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our common stock option awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense

table of contents analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of sales from our roadway sensors segment 
contract revenues consist of revenues from our transportation systems segment 
the following tables present details of our net sales and contract revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended march  increase decrease change in thousands  except percentages net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues year ended march  increase decrease change in thousands  except percentages net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues we currently have a diverse customer base  and no individual customer represented greater than of our total a net sales and contract revenues for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal net sales net sales of roadway sensors products in fiscal were marginally lower compared to fiscal due primarily to certain international customer orders in fiscal which did not recur in the current year 
we believe we continued to gain domestic market share in fiscal  mainly as a result of new product introductions and other competitive advantages  however  our gains in market share were offset in part by lower prices due to competitive pressures 
the increase in roadway sensors net sales in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  were driven by higher unit sales domestically from both our direct sales and dealer markets  which was offset in part by lower prices due to competitive pressures 
we also saw particular strength  both domestically and internationally  in certain of our newer product lines which were introduced within the previous two fiscal years 
additionally  we believe we gained market share as a result of these new product introductions 
contract revenues our contract revenues are primarily dependent upon the continued availability of funding at the local  state and federal levels from the various agencies and departments of transportation 
contract revenues in fiscal increased compared to fiscal in part due to several significant project wins in the last two quarters of fiscal additionally in fiscal  we recognized million and  of total contract revenues derived from our acquisitions of met and bts  respectively  which contributed to the overall increase 
in fiscal  the transportation system segment continued to experience similar general lengthening of overall sales cycles  government budget constraints and funding delays and or reductions on various existing contracts that existed in fiscal our transportation systems contract revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the ongoing weakness in the markets this segment serves  which has been aggravated by the general lengthening of the overall sales cycle  from the bid and proposal process  to the signing of a contract and commencement of work on a project 
government budgeting constraints and funding delays or reductions on various existing contracts  particularly in the southeast region of the us  also contributed to the decline in our contract revenues 
our private planning group  which focuses on private development consulting  has likewise experienced particular weakness 
additionally  our fiscal contract revenues included approximately million of revenues attributable to met  which we acquired in january going forward  we plan to continue to pursue larger contracts that may contain significant sub consulting content  which will likely contribute to variability in the timing and amount of our contract revenues and margins from period to period 
we also intend to continue to expand our foreign operations by pursuing additional international opportunities in the middle east and other regions 
among other factors  we believe the ability of our transportation systems segment to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  as well as upon the passage of a new federal highway bill and other government funding initiatives in the markets we serve 

table of contents gross profit 
the following tables present details of our gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues year ended march  increase change in thousands  except percentages total gross profit total gross profit as a of total net sales and contract revenues gross profit as a of net sales gross profit as a of contract revenues our total gross profit as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our product and service mix  whereby transportation systems consulting revenues discussed below significantly increased as percentage of the total 
our net sales derived from our roadway sensors segment represented approximately of our total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal our net sales generally carry higher margins than our contract revenues  which are derived primarily from our consulting services 
our total gross profit as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of our product and service mix 
in fiscal  our net sales represented approximately of our total net sales and contract revenues as compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of sales mix as well as certain manufacturing overhead costs previously absorbed by sales of vehicle sensors products 
the vehicle sensors segment was divested in july our gross margin on net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on  among other factors  customer and product mix  competitive pricing requirements  product warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  as well as shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
the increase in gross margin on net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of higher overall net sales and higher margins in roadway sensors during fiscal such higher margins were largely driven by our customer mix and lower costs for certain key materials 
we generally enjoy higher gross margins on direct product sales as compared to sales throgh our dealer channel 
we recognize contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting when appropriate  while certain of our contract revenues are recognized as services are performed and amounts are earned  which is measured by time incurred or other contractual milestones or output measures 
therefore  the underlying mix of contract activity can affect the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal was lower than in fiscal primarily due to the overall mix of contract revenues which in the current year contained a significant proportion of lower margin sub consulting content as well as lower margins stemming from seasonality due to the decrease in revenues from certain of our mdss and weather forecasting services in the spring and summer time periods 
gross profit as percent of contract revenues in fiscal were highly consistent with those of fiscal we expect the variability and timing of contract mix and related sub consulting content in our transportation systems segment in future periods  as well as factors such as paid holidays and our ability to efficiently utilize our workforce  will cause fluctuations in our margins from contract revenues from period to period 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal year ended march  of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i higher salary  travel and headcount related expenses as we added certain key sales and marketing personnel  ii added personnel as well as facilities and other related operating costs as a result of the met and bts acquisitions  iii legal and professional services related to the sale of our vehicle sensors segment and iv certain other corporate initiatives related to the development of our performance measurement software 
the following table presents selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal and year ended march  of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  insurance and supplies travel and conferences professional and outside services other selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to i higher selling and commission related expenses for our roadway sensors segment  as total net sales increased approximately from fiscal levels  ii higher salary and headcount related expenses as we have added certain key sales and marketing personnel in all of our business segments  including as a result of the acquisition of met in january  and iii additional legal and professional services related to our acquisition of met  along with various other corporate initiatives 
we also saw a shift from cost of sales to sales and marketing of certain of our headcount expenses in our transportation systems segment in fiscal commensurate with the overall decline in this segment s revenues and the reallocation of existing personnel in an effort to expand our contract backlog and increase contract revenues 
additionally  during fiscal  we realized approximately  in reversals of certain previously recorded bad debt expense included in the other category in the table above as a result of collecting certain large accounts receivable balances 
in prior periods  we had recorded an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts against these receivables given the uncertainty of collection at that time 
in the future  our operating results in any given period may be favorably or adversely impacted as a result of our estimates of the realization of our accounts receivable 

table of contents research and development expense the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and fiscal year ended march  of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  development and supplies other research and development research and development expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal primarily due to i the allocation of additional resources to various development projects in our roadway sensors segment  including our vantage vector vehicle detection sensor  ii development costs related to our iterispems information management solution  and iii additional headcount and other expenses in fiscal related to the met and bts acquisitions 
the following table presents research and development expense for fiscal and year ended march  of net of net sales and sales and contract contract increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change in thousands  except percentages salary and personnel related facilities  development and supplies other research and development research and development expenses for fiscal were generally consistent  in total  with those of fiscal we believe research and development activities are crucial to our ability to continue to be a leader in our markets 
impairment of goodwill in fiscal  we early adopted the new provisions issued by the fasb that are intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
we performed the annual impairment assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for fiscal in the fourth fiscal quarter 
based on our assessments  we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
during fiscal  due primarily to lower than expected operating results in our transportation systems reporting unit  as well as ongoing weakness specifically in the transportation systems markets  we determined it was necessary to perform an interim test of impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in our transportation systems reporting unit as of december  in performing the first step in this analysis  we estimated the fair value of our transportation systems reporting unit using the income approach 
as of december   we determined that the carrying value of our transportation systems reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and  accordingly  we performed the second step of the impairment analysis to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill of this reporting unit 

table of contents the implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
to determine this value  we estimated the fair value of the assets and liabilities  including certain intangible assets  to be allocated to the transportation systems reporting unit as of december  the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value amounts of its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for the transportation systems reporting unit was measured by the amount the carrying value of its goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
accordingly  in order to write down transportation systems goodwill with a carrying value of million to its implied fair value of million  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the three months ended december   the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the impairment charge taken in fiscal  we believe we have no goodwill at risk  as the estimated fair values of our roadway sensors and transportations systems reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values at march  if our actual financial results  or the plans and estimates used in future goodwill impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess for impairment of our goodwill  we could incur future goodwill impairment charges 
interest expense  net net interest expense was approximately   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the sequential decreases were primarily due to our lower overall level of borrowings  as we continue to make monthly principal payments on our term note 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional details on our borrowings 
income taxes the following table presents our provision for income taxes for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recognition of approximately  of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to the expiration of statutes limitation in various jurisdictions  by the recognition of tax credits of approximately  for research and development activities  and by approximately  of tax benefit from non taxable favorable fair value adjustments recognized for financial statement purposes 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by the impact of recognizing approximately  of expense upon the expiration of a state net operating loss  net of federal benefit 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted unfavorably by a portion of the charge recorded for the impairment of goodwill  amounting to approximately million  for which there is no corresponding tax basis 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the impact of the recognition of approximately  of previously unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recognition of approximately  of unrecognized tax benefits during the year due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes in various jurisdictions 
as of march  and  respectively  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax assets as of either such dates 
in making our determination as to the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we reviewed all available positive and negative evidence  including reversal of deferred tax liabilities  potential carrybacks  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
as we update our estimates in future periods  adjustments to our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance may be necessary 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including  but not limited to  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 

table of contents at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined at this time  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards will cause us to have future income tax payments that are substantially lower than the income tax liability calculated using statutory tax rates 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other federal attributes are subject to a section annual limitation 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and the availability of borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund potential future acquisitions and our future growth 
we may raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution and any equity securities that may be issued may have rights senior to our existing stockholders 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
this compares to working capital of million at march   which included no borrowings on our line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents

we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit during the preceding month 
the revolving line of credit does not contain any early termination fees and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit portion of the facility 
availability under this line of credit may be reduced or otherwise limited as a result of our obligations to comply with certain financial covenants  as described further below 
as of march   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately  under our bank term note  which expires on may  principal payments under this term note are required to be repaid in monthly installments of  additionally  beginning on november   and on november of each year thereafter  we are required to repay additional principal of up to  calculated based on certain financial measures  as further defined in the loan agreement

if we were to be in violation of covenants under this agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances and pursue its security interest in our assets 
in this event  we cannot assure you that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing on acceptable terms  on a timely basis  or at all 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of financing  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition
