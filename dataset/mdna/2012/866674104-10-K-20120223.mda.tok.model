item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
we are a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit 
we own  operate  and develop manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states 
as of december   we owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in states  including manufactured housing communities  eight rv communities  and properties containing both manufactured housing and rv sites 
the majority of our revenue income from real property is affected by occupancy and our ability to raise rents 
our residents normally sign a one year lease and then lease on a month to month basis for the next ten to fifteen years 
few of our leases are tied to published cpi statistics or other indices therefore allowing us significant flexibility in rental increases based on the markets in which we operate 
weighted average rent increases over the last five years have ranged from percent to percent and we expect to continue to be able to increase rents at or near these levels in the future 
our occupancy has also increased over the past three years from as of december  to as of december  our rental program is a significant contributor to the stability and improvement of our occupancies and revenue stream 
over the past several years  the rental program has been the single largest contributor to the generation of applications to live in our communities  which numbered nearly  in we own and rent approximately  homes throughout our portfolio applying stringent approval standards over of our rental applications are denied to each applicant thereby ensuring maintenance of the quality of our communities as desirable neighborhoods in which to live 
during  occupants in the rental program increased by home sales units sold have increased from  in to  in and we anticipate selling approximately  homes in the coming year 
our ability to sell homes is dependent on access to financing for the prospective buyer 
although the majority of our home sales are financed through third party lenders  some of which we provide recourse  we do provide financing for certain home purchasers who are unable to obtain financing through other means 
the economic downturns and market volatility during the past few years have presented both challenges and opportunities 
we provide affordable housing to the marketplace which  in difficult times  improves demand for the housing values that our products and programs offer 
this demand is somewhat offset by job losses in our resident base resulting from businesses closing and layoffs which occur in times of economic contraction 
the broader financial markets which provide capital for funding our continued growth and refinancing of debt are improving  but remain constrained and contain terms more restrictive than when most of our current debt was originated 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimate and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment property investment property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for impairment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in the anticipated market price  an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long lived asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when a long lived asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our long lived assets based on future cash flows and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset 
forecasting cash flows requires management to make estimates and assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period  rental rates  occupancy  development and operating expenses during the holding period  as well as disposition proceeds 
management uses its best judgment when developing these estimates and assumptions  but the development of the projected future cash flows is based on subjective variables 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist  and significant adverse changes in national  regional  or local market conditions or trends may cause us to change the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
the results of an impairment analysis could be material to our financial statements 
capitalized costs we capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of our properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for our rental program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident 
costs associated with implementing our computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
notes and other receivables we provide financing to purchasers of manufactured homes generally located in our communities 
the notes are collateralized by the underlying manufactured home sold 
notes receivable include both installment loans retained by the company as well as transferred loans that have not met the requirements for sale accounting which are presented herein as collateralized receivables see note for additional information 
for purposes of accounting policy  all notes receivable are considered one homogenous segment  as the notes are typically underwritten using the same requirements and terms 
notes receivable are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance adjusted for an allowance for loan loss 
interest income is accrued based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loans 
past due status of our notes receivable is determined based upon the contractual terms of the note 
when a note receivable becomes days delinquent  we stop accruing interest on the note receivable 
the interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
loans on a nonaccrual status were immaterial at december  and the ability to collect our notes receivable is measured based on current and historical information and events 
we consider numerous factors including length of delinquency  estimated costs to lease or sell  and repossession history 
our experience supports a high recovery rate for notes receivable  however there is some degree of uncertainty about the recoverability of our investment in these notes receivable 
we are generally able to recover our recorded investment in uncollectible notes receivable by repossessing the homes on the notes retained by us and repurchasing the homes on the collateralized receivables  and subsequently selling or leasing these homes to potential residents in our communities 
we have established a loan loss reserve based on our estimated unrecoverable costs associated with repossessed repurchased homes 
we estimate our unrecoverable costs to be the repurchase price of the home collateralizing the note receivable plus repair and remarketing costs in excess of the estimated selling price of the home being repossessed 
a historical average of this excess cost is calculated based on prior repossessions repurchases and is applied to our estimated annual future repossessions to create the allowance for both installment and collateralized notes receivable 
see note for additional information 
we evaluate the collectability of a loan based on our ability to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we generally see that if the obligor is delinquent on the loan they are also delinquent on site rent 
if the scheduled payment is delinquent more than five to seven days  dependent on state law  we begin the repossession and eviction process simultaneously 
this process generally takes to days  due to the short time frame from delinquent loan to repossession we do not evaluate the notes receivables for impairments 
no loans were considered impaired as of december  and we evaluate the credit quality of our notes receivable at the inception of the receivable 
we consider the following factors in order to determine the credit quality of the applicant fico scores  home debt to income ratio  total debt to income ratio  length of employment  and previous landlord references 
other receivables are generally comprised of amounts due from residents for rent and related charges  home sale proceeds receivable from sales near year end and various other miscellaneous receivables 
accounts receivable from residents are typically due within days and stated at amounts due from residents net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we evaluate the recoverability of our receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements 
receivables related to community rents are reserved when we believe that collection is less than probable  which is generally after a resident balance reaches to days past due 
investment in affiliates investments in affiliates in which we do not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest  but can exercise significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the carrying value of our investment is adjusted for our proportionate share of the affiliate s net income or loss and reduced by distributions received 
we review the carrying value of our investment in affiliates for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
financial condition  operational performance  and other economic trends are some of the factors we consider when we evaluate the existence of impairment indicators 
when we have a carrying value of zero for our investment  we suspend the equity method of accounting until such time that the affiliate s net income equals or exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the time in which the equity method of accounting was suspended 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to site and home leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants are generally for one year terms but may range from month to month to two years and are renewable by mutual agreement from us and the resident  or in some cases  as provided by state statute 
revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction 
interest income on notes receivable is recorded on a level yield basis over the life of the notes 
we report certain taxes collected from the resident and remitted to taxing authorities in revenue 
these taxes include certain florida property and fire taxes 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are years for land improvements and buildings  years for rental homes  seven to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment  and seven years for intangible assets 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we have four derivative contracts consisting of two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million  and an two interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of million as of december  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
for those hedges that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  we adjust our balance sheet on a quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of our derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of these hedges are immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the effective portion of these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we use standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the code 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if we distribute at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to our stockholders  which we fully intend to do 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we remain subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
we are subject to certain state taxes that are considered income taxes and have certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu  reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements asu which amends asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the updated guidance in asc topic removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms  even in the event of default by the transferee  and the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition  and we will apply the provisions after the effective date 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu which amends asc topic  fair value measurement 
the updated guidance in asc topic changes the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of asu on our results of operations  financial condition and disclosure requirements 
we will apply the provisions of these accounting standards after the effective date 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu which amends asc topic  comprehensive income 
the updated guidance in asc topic gives an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated guidance in asc topic is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu to defer the effective date for part of asu the deferral of asu is to defer the requirement of adjustments of items out of accumulated other income to be presented on the components of both net income and other comprehensive income in financial statements 
this deferral is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentations requirements in asu that asu is deferring 
early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
supplemental measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with gaap  we have provided information regarding net operating income noi in the following tables 
noi is derived from revenues minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
we use noi as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of our operations 
a reconciliation of noi to net income loss attributable to sun communities  inc is included in results of operations below 
we believe that noi is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time 
we use noi as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and or groups of properties 
the principal limitation of noi is that it excludes depreciation  amortization  interest expense  and non property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  all of which are significant costs  and therefore  noi is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the company overall 
we believe that these costs included in net income loss often have no effect on the market value of our property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure 
in addition  such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset 
noi should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our financial performance  or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
noi  as determined and presented by us  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we also provide information regarding funds from operations ffo 
we consider ffo an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  ffo represents net income  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  and gain loss on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management also uses ffo adjusted a non gaap financial measure  which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business 
we believe that ffo adjusted provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results 
a discussion of ffo  ffo adjusted  a reconciliation of ffo to net loss  and ffo to ffo adjusted are included in the presentation of ffo in results of operations following the comparison of the years ended december  and 
results of operations we report operating results under two segments real property operations and home sales and rentals 
the real property operations segment owns  operates  and develops manufactured housing and rv communities concentrated in the midwestern  southern  and southeastern united states and is in the business of acquiring  operating  and expanding manufactured housing and rv communities 
the home sales and rentals segment offers manufactured home sales and leasing services to tenants and prospective tenants of our communities 
we evaluate segment operating performance based on noi 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements  except for the use of noi 
we may allocate certain common costs  primarily corporate functions  between the segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these allocated costs include expenses for shared services such as information technology  finance  communications  legal  and human resources 
we do not allocate interest expense and certain other corporate costs not directly associated with the segments noi

occupied sites do not include  sites acquired during the total change in occupied sites including acquired sites is  sites 
average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites  and excludes permanent and seasonal rv sites 
real property noi increased by million  from million to million or 
the growth in noi is primarily due to million from the newly acquired properties and million from the same site properties as detailed below 
real property operations same site a key management tool we use when evaluating performance and growth of our properties is a comparison of same site communities 
same site communities consist of properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended december  and the same site data may change from time to time depending on acquisitions  dispositions  management discretion  significant transactions  or unique situations 
in order to evaluate the growth of the same site communities  management has classified certain items differently than our gaap statements 
the reclassification difference between our gaap statements and our same site portfolio is the reclassification of water and sewer revenues from income from real property to utilities 
a significant portion of our utility charges are re billed to our residents 
we reclassify these amounts to reflect the utility expenses associated with our same site portfolio  net of recovery 
the following tables reflect certain financial and other information for our same site communities as of and for the years ended december  and years ended december  financial information in thousands change change income from real property property operating expenses payroll and benefits legal  taxes  insurance utilities supplies and repair other real estate taxes property operating expenses real property noi as of december  other information change number of properties developed sites occupied sites occupancy weighted average monthly rent per site sites available for development occupied sites and occupancy include manufactured housing and permanent rv sites  and exclude seasonal rv sites 
occupancy excludes completed but vacant expansion sites 
average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites  and excludes permanent and seasonal rv sites 
real property noi increased by million from million to million  or percent 
the growth in noi is primarily due to increased revenues 
income from real property revenues consist of manufactured home and rv site rent  and miscellaneous other property revenues 
income from real property revenues increased million  from million to million  or percent 
the growth in income from real property was due to a combination of factors 
revenue from our manufactured home and rv portfolio increased by million due to average rental rate increases of percent and due to the increased number of occupied home sites 
this growth in revenue was partially offset by rent concessions offered to new residents and current residents converting from home renters to home owners 
additionally  we experienced increased miscellaneous other property revenues of million primarily due to revenue realized on cable television royalties and revenue from late fee and non sufficient funds charges 
property operating expenses increased million  from million to million  or percent 
the growth in property operating expenses was due to several factors 
payroll and benefits increased by million due to increased wages from annual merit increases 
supplies and repairs increased by million primarily due to increased cost of lawn services and community maintenance 
utility costs reported net of rebilled water sewer revenue  primarily related to water  electricity charges  and rubbish removal  decreased million due to increased water and sewer income 
real estate taxes decreased by million primarily due to reduced real estate taxes in indiana and illinois 
legal  taxes and insurance remained nearly constant 
other operating expenses increased by million due to increased bank charges  resident relation expenses  and bad debt expense 
home sales and rentals we acquire pre owned and repossessed manufactured homes located within our communities from lenders and dealers at substantial discounts 
we lease or sell these value priced homes to current and prospective residents 
we also purchase new homes to lease and sell to current and prospective residents 
the programs we have established for our customers to lease or buy new and pre owned homes have helped to improve portfolio occupancy

the site rent is reflected in the real property operations segment 
for purposes of management analysis  the site rent is included in the rental program revenue to evaluate the incremental revenue gains associated with implementation of the rental program  and assess the overall growth and performance of rental program and financial impact to our operations 
rental program noi increased million from million to million  or percent due to increased revenues of million  offset by increased expenses of million 
revenues increased million primarily due to the increased number of residents participating in the rental program as indicated in the table above and from increased market rates from the site rent 
the increase in operating and maintenance expenses of million was due to several factors 
commissions increased by million due to increased number of new leases and increased lease renewal rate 
repairs costs on occupied home rentals increased by million due to the increased number of homes in the rental program 
refurbishment costs increased by million 
marketing and other costs increased by million due to an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a decrease in utility expense

the gross profit margin on new home sales slightly increased due to the increased average selling price per new home sold 
the gross profit margin on pre owned home sales decreased percent from percent to percent 
we decreased the average margin of our pre owned homes to stimulate sales thereby accelerating the recycling of the capital invested in inventory and the rental program 
approximately percent of these home sales are financed by third party lenders or are paid for in cash 
other income statement items other revenues include other income loss  interest income  and ancillary revenues  net

the decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of million was due to several factors 
commissions decreased by million due to restructuring of the commission plan associated with new and renewed leases 
expenses associated with repairs and refurbishment increased by million 
repairs costs on occupied home rentals increased by million due to the increased number of occupied homes in the rental program offset by refurbishment costs which decreased by million due to a decline in the average cost associated with preparing a previously leased home for a new occupant

the gross profit margin on pre owned home sales decreased percent from percent to percent 
the majority of our pre owned home sales are related to homes previously used in our rental program 
these sales convert home renters to home owners and thereby allow us to recycle capital invested in the rental program 
we decreased the average selling price of our pre owned homes to increase the volume of sales thereby accelerating the recycling of this capital 
approximately percent of these home sales are financed by third party lenders or are paid for in cash 
other income statement items other revenues include other income loss  interest income  and ancillary revenues  net 
other revenues increased by million  from million to million  or percent 
this increase was due to increased interest income of million 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the additional installment notes receivable recognized in association with the transfer of financial assets that are recorded as collateralized receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the interest income on these collateralized receivables is offset by the same amount of interest expense recognized on the secured debt recorded in association with this transaction 
see note for additional information 
real property general and administrative costs decreased by million  from million to million  or percent due to reduced sales  use and other tax expense of million and decreased salary and other compensation costs of million offset by increased legal costs of million and increased other expenses of million

interest expense on debt  including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt  increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to increased expense associated with the increase in our fnma facility fee of million and our secured borrowing arrangements of million partially offset by a reduction in expense of million primarily due to lower interest rates charged on variable rate debt 
the interest expense on our secured borrowing is offset completely by the interest income recognized on our collateralized receivables

equity loss from affiliates decreased by million  from a loss of million  to loss of million  net of million cash distribution  or percent due to limited recognition of our allocation of origen s and the llc s equity losses 
we suspend equity accounting in periods in which the recognition of equity losses would reduce the carrying value of our investment below zero 
provision for state income taxes increased by million  from million to million  or percent due to the utilization of investment tax credits which reduced tax expense in the following table is a summary of our consolidated financial results which were discussed in more detail in the preceding paragraphs in thousands years ended december  real property noi rental program noi home sales noi gross profit site rent from rental program included in real property noi noi gross profit adjustments to arrive at net loss other revenues general and administrative georgia flood damage acquisition related costs depreciation and amortization asset impairment charge interest expense provision for state income taxes equity income loss and distributions from affiliates loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss less preferred return to preferred op units less amounts attributable to common noncontrolling interests net loss attributable to sun communities  inc common stockholders funds from operations we provide information regarding ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
ffo is defined by the nareit as net income loss computed in accordance gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
due to the variety among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  we believe excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  provides a better indicator of our operating performance 
ffo is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  and operating costs  providing perspective not readily apparent from net income loss 
management believes that the use of ffo has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management  the investment community  and banking institutions routinely use ffo  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses ffo for planning and forecasting future periods 
because ffo excludes significant economic components of net income loss including depreciation and amortization  ffo should be used as an adjunct to net income loss and not as an alternative to net income loss 
the principal limitation of ffo is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income loss as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
ffo only provides investors with an additional performance measure 
management also uses ffo adjusted a non gaap financial measure  which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business 
we believe that ffo adjusted provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results 
other reits may use different methods for calculating ffo and ffo adjusted and  accordingly  our ffo and ffo adjusted may not be comparable to other reits

liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to our stockholders and the unitholders of the operating partnership  capital improvements to properties  the purchase of new and pre owned homes  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  and debt repayment 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through working capital provided by operating activities and through borrowings on our lines of credit 
we consider these resources to be adequate to meet our operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  payment of dividends to our stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the code  and payment of distributions to our operating partnership s unitholders 
we closed on four acquisitions in in which we acquired properties in total  manufactured housing communities and five rv communities 
subsequent to year end  we acquired three additional rv communities 
see note for details on the acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria for acquisition 
should additional investment opportunities arise in  we will finance the acquisitions through secured financing  the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities 
during the year ended december   we have invested million related to the acquisition of homes intended for the rental program net of proceeds from third party financing from homes sales 
expenditures for will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales  as well as rental homes 
we finance new home purchases with a million floor plan facility 
our ability to purchase homes for sale or rent may be limited by cash received from third party financing of our home sales  available floor plan financing and working capital available on our secured line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from million at december   to million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by  among other things a the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally  and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets  b lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties  c increased operating costs  such as wage and benefit costs  insurance premiums  real estate taxes and utilities  that cannot be passed on to our tenants  d decreased sales of manufactured homes and e current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets

we have a secured revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of million  subject to certain borrowing base calculations 
the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit as of december  and borrowings under the line of credit bear a floating interest rate based on eurodollar plus a margin that is determined based on our leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the line of credit agreement  which can range from to 
the effective weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was percent as of december  as of december   million was available to be drawn under the facility based on the calculation of the borrowing base 
during  the highest balance on the line of credit was million 
the borrowings under the line of credit mature october   assuming the election of a one year extension that is available at our discretion  subject to certain conditions 
although the secured revolving line of credit is a committed facility  the financial failure of one or more of the participating financial institutions may reduce the amount of available credit for use by us 
the line of credit facility contains various leverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which we were in compliance with as of december  the most limiting covenants contained in the line of credit are the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios 
the maximum leverage ratio covenant requires that total indebtedness be no more than percent of total asset value as defined in the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires a minimum ratio of as of december   the leverage coverage was percent and the fixed charge coverage ratio was liquidity and capital resources  continued the slow economy and the conservative lending environment have generally resulted in a reduction of availability of financing and higher borrowing costs 
although base interest rates have generally decreased relative to their levels prior to the disruptions in the financial markets  the tightening of credit markets has affected the credit risk spreads charged over base interest rates on  and the availability of  mortgage loan financing 
for us  this is the most relevant consequence of financial market volatility 
we believe this risk is somewhat mitigated because we have adequate working capital provided by operating activities as noted above and debt maturities are appropriately staggered we anticipate meeting our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions  and operating partnership unit redemptions through the issuance of certain debt or equity securities and or the collateralization of our properties 
we currently have unencumbered properties with an estimated market value of million  most of which support the borrowing base for our million secured line of credit 
from time to time  we may also issue shares of our capital stock or preferred stock  issue equity units in our operating partnership  utilize debt and or equity venture capital  or sell selected assets 
our ability to finance our long term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  our financial condition  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional  and local economic conditions 
when it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets  the volatility in those markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure  more expensive  or effectively unavailable 
see risk factors in item a 
if we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
our primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   our outstanding contractual obligations  including interest expense  were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years collateralized term loans cmbs collateralized term loans fnma aspen and series b preferred op units lines of credit secured borrowing mortgage notes  other total principal payments interest expense operating leases total contractual obligations our contractual cash obligation related to interest expense is calculated based on the current debt levels  rates and maturities as of december  excluding secured borrowings  and actual payments required in future periods may be different than the amounts included above 
as of december   our debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common operating partnership units to shares of common stock 
our debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
we are committed to the continued upkeep of our properties and therefore do not expect a significant decline in our recurring capital expenditures during liquidity and capital resources  continued net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the difference is due to increased acquisitions of million  increased investment in property of million  and decreased principal repayment on an officer s notes and other notes receivable of million  offset by increased proceeds related to disposition of assets of million and increased dividend distribution from affiliate of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million net cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  the difference is due to increased net proceeds received from the issuance of additional shares of million  increased proceeds from issuance of other debt net of repayments on other debt of million  increased net borrowings on the line of credit of million  increased proceeds from stock option exercises of million  and decreased payments to retire preferred operating partnership units of million  offset by increased payments of deferred financing costs of million and increased distributions to our stockholders and op unitholders of million due to equity issuances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
we mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the effect variability interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows 
we generally employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
we have four derivative contracts consisting of two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million  and two interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of million as of december  the first swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through july the second swap agreement fixes million of variable rate borrowings at percent through january the first interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million  and a termination date of may  the second interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of percent  a notional amount of million  and a termination date of october  each of these derivative contracts is based upon day libor 
our remaining variable rate debt totals million and million as of december  and  respectively  which bear interest at prime  various libor or fannie mae discounted mortgage backed securities dmbs rates 
if prime  libor  or dmbs increased or decreased by percent during the years ended december  and  we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million based on the million and million average balances outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a portion of our variable debt is floating on dmbs rates 
if the credit markets tighten  and there are fewer or no buyers of this security  the interest rate may be negatively impacted resulting in higher interest expense
