overview our radio broadcasting segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
historically  our principal sources of broadcast revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our principal sources of internet revenue include the sale of internet advertising  the support and promotion to stream third party content on our websites  sales of software and support services  and product sales and royalties for on air host materials 
our principal sources of publishing revenue include subscription fees for our magazines  the sale of print magazine advertising  fees from authors for book publishing  and the sale of books 
broadcast segment broadcast revenues are impacted by the program rates our radio stations charge  the level of broadcast airtime sold and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their 
table of contents advertisers 
we do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets  we do subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
arbitron has developed technology to collect data for its ratings service 
the ppm is a small device that does not require active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service is already in a number of our markets and is scheduled to be introduced in more markets in the future 
it is not clear what long term impact  if any  the introduction of the ppm will have on our revenues for stations that subscribe to arbitron 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually and are recognized on a per program basis 
we currently program of our stations with our christian teaching and talk format  which is talk programming with christian and family themes 
we also program news talk stations  contemporary christian music stations  business format stations  and spanish language christian teaching and talk stations 
the business format features financial experts  business talk  and nationally recognized bloomberg programming 
the business format operates similar to our christian teaching and talk format as it features long form block programming 
our cash flow is historically affected by a transitional period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transitional period is when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our broadcast revenue for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and expect to continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions and existing and future borrowings 
internet segment salem web network and our internet business earns revenues from the sales of streaming services  sales of advertising and  to a lesser extent  sales of software  software support contracts and consumer products such as dvd s and editorial products 
the revenues of these businesses are reported as internet revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
the primary operating expense incurred in the ownership and operation of our internet businesses include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv streaming costs 
publishing segment our publishing business  salem publishing  earns revenues from advertising in and subscriptions to our magazine publications and from book sales

non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate station operating income 
we define station operating income soi as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses 
accordingly  changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses  as explained above  have a direct impact on changes in soi 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
soi should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency  profitability and our internal review associated with our impairment analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
soi as defined by and used by our company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other non intangible assets  uncertain tax positions  valuation allowance deferred taxes  long term debt and debt covenant compliance  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  see note  significant accounting policies  accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
note contains several other policies which are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets a majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license 
it is our policy generally to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks  internet businesses or publishing properties 
the allocations assigned to acquired broadcast licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports that assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of these properties at the close of the transaction 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc broadcast licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete  at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
when the completion of a project is contingent upon fcc or other 
table of contents regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable or the project is abandoned  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
revenues from radio programs and commercial advertising are recognized when the program or advertisement is broadcast 
revenue is reported net of agency commissions  which are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
our customers principally include not for profit charitable organizations and commercial advertisers 
revenue from the sale of products and services are recognized when the products are shipped and the services are rendered 
revenues from the sale of advertising in our magazines are recognized upon publication 
revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our publications is recognized over the life of the subscription 
revenue from book sales are recorded when shipment occurs 
multiple deliverables we may enter bundled advertising agreements that include spot advertisements on our radio stations  internet banner placements  print magazine advertisements and booth space at specific events  or some combination thereof 
the multiple deliverables contained in each agreement are accounted for separately over their respective delivery period provided that they are separate units of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available or estimated selling price if vendor specific objective evidence is not available 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for each element when it is sold separately 
the estimated selling price is the price that we would transact if the deliverable were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of each arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
the adoption of asu no  did not change the units of accounting  how we allocate consideration to various units of accounting  or the timing of revenue recognition 
barter transactions we may provide advertising time in exchange for certain products  supplies and services 
the terms of the exchanges generally permit for the preemption of such broadcast time in favor of advertisers who purchase time on regular terms 
we include the value of such exchanges in both net broadcasting revenues and broadcast operating expenses 
the value recorded for barter revenues is based upon management s estimate of the fair value of the products  supplies and services received 
advertising time that our radio stations exchange for goods and or services is recorded as barter revenue when the advertisement is broadcast at an amount equal to our estimate fair value of what was received 
the value of the goods and services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense when used 
barter advertising revenue included in broadcast revenue for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  and barter expenses were approximately the same as barter revenue for each period 
advertising by our internet businesses exchanged for goods and or services are recognized as the advertisements are delivered at an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
the value of the goods and services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense when used 
barter advertising revenue included in internet revenue for the years ended december   and was approximately  million and million  respectively  and barter expenses were approximately the same as barter revenue for each period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents accounting for discontinued operations we regularly review underperforming assets to determine if a sale might be a better way to monetize the assets 
when a station  group of stations  or other asset groups are considered for sale  we review the transaction to determine if or when the entity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc topic discontinued operations 
this pronouncement specifies that the operations and cash flow of the entity disposed of  or to be sold  have or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal and that we will not have significant continuing involvement in the operations after the disposal transaction 
for our radio stations  we define a cluster as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building  equipment  and managed by a single general manager 
the cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results 
general managers are compensated based on the results of their cluster as a whole  not the results of any individual radio stations 
we have determined that a radio market qualifies for a discontinued operation when management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset disposal group  the sale is probable  and the sale will result in the exit of a particular geographic market 
during the th quarter of  based on operating results that did not meet expectations  we ceased operating samaritan fundraising as of december  samaritan fundraising  reported in our internet operations  was a web based fundraising products company operating from a single facility in fairfax  va  under the control of one general manager 
as a result of our decision to close operations  there will be no material cash flows associated with this entity and we will have no ongoing or further involvement in the operations of this entity 
we have reported the operating results and net assets of this entity as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december   consist of indefinite lived intangible assets  such as broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads  the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
broadcast licenses are renewed with the fcc every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred 
we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our broadcast licenses are renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all broadcast licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
accordingly  we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
broadcast licenses account for approximately of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and magazine mastheads account for the remaining 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
we complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
we believe that our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses  mastheads  and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimates incorporate variables and assumptions that are based on experiences and judgment about future operating performance of our markets and business segments 
the fair value measurements for our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
the unobservable inputs are defined in fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures as level inputs discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
broadcast licenses the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager 
the cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results 
we apply the start up income approach  which measures the expected future economic benefits that the broadcast licenses provide and discounts these future benefits using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis assumes that the broadcast licenses hypothetical start up stations and the values yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis represent the portion of the stations value attributable solely to the broadcast license 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as projected revenues  operating profit margins  forecasted growth rates  estimated start up costs  losses expected to be incurred in the early years  competition within the market  the effective tax rate  future terminal values and the risk adjusted discount rate 
impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value as determined by the start up income approach 

table of contents the key estimates and assumptions used in the start up income valuation of our broadcast segment for each testing period are as follows december  broadcast licenses discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term market revenue growth rate ranges the tables below present the percentage within a range by which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses for each of our clusters

based on deteriorating macro economic factors  including declining radio industry revenues throughout and a weakening in prevailing radio station transaction multiples  we tested our broadcast licenses for impairment in the second and third quarters of we recognized pre tax impairment charges during our september   interim review and valuation of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the cleveland  atlanta  detroit and portland markets  and pre tax impairment charges recognized during our june  interim review and valuation of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the dallas and portland markets 
the impairments recognized during were driven in part by declining revenues at the industry and market levels  declining radio stations transaction multiples and a higher cost of capital 
the impairments were indicative of a trend in the broadcast industry and were not unique to the company 
mastheads mastheads consist of the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers 
these include customized typeset page headers  section headers  and column graphics as well as other name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication 
we test the value of mastheads as a single combined publishing entity as our print magazines operate from one shared facility under one general manager with operating results and cash flows reported on a combined basis for all publications 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal firm  to perform an income based approach to determine the estimated fair value of our mastheads 
the income approach is based upon an estimated royalty stream that measures a cost savings to the business because it does not have to pay a royalty to use the owned trade name and content 
the analysis assumes that the assets are employed by a typical market participant in their highest and best use 
under the income approach  we utilize a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of our mastheads  the key estimates and assumptions to which are as follows 
table of contents december  mastheads discount rate projected revenue growth ranges royalty growth rate based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending december   and the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of our mastheads by as of december  based on then deteriorating macro economic factors  including declining magazine industry revenues throughout  we tested our mastheads for impairment in the second quarter of for the interim testing period ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the value of mastheads in our publishing segment 
the impairment recognized during was driven by negative revenue growth projections and a reduction in cash flows for magazine operations 
the impairments were indicative of a trend in the publishing industry and were not unique to the company 
goodwill broadcast the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager 
we apply a market approach and an income approach to estimate the estimated fair value of each of our clusters when testing goodwill associated with our broadcast segment for impairment 
eight of our market clusters and our networks have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ending december  seven of our thirty market clusters and our network had goodwill associated with them for our annual testing periods ending december  and the first step of our review compares the estimated fair value of each cluster to its carrying value including goodwill 
under the market approach  we apply a multiple of six to each clusters station operating income soi to calculate the estimated fair value 
as radio stations are typically sold on the basis of a multiple of soi  typically in excess of eight  we believe that a benchmark of six is a conservative measure even in today s market 
under the income approach  we utilize a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of the accounting unit 
the discounted cash flow analysis assumes that the broadcast licenses are hypothetical start up stations and the values yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis represent the portion of the stations value attributable to the broadcast license 
the key estimates and assumptions used in the start up income valuation of our broadcast units for each testing period are as follows december  goodwill radio clusters discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term market revenue growth rate ranges if the carrying amount  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value of the cluster  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that cluster may be impaired 
when we have indication of impairment  we perform a second step to determine the amount of any impairment 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  to determine the enterprise value of five of our clusters and our networks in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start up 
the key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows december  enterprise valuations networks radio clusters discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term revenue market growth rate ranges based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending december   and the estimated fair value of our networks exceeded the carrying value by  and for each of the annual testing periods ending december   and  respectively

the impairments recognized during were driven in part by declining revenues at the industry and market levels  declining radio stations transaction multiples and a higher cost of capital 
the impairments were indicative of a trend in the broadcast industry and were not unique to the company 
goodwill internet publishing the units of accounting we use to test goodwill in our internet business include townhall 
com and salem web network 
the operating results for salem web network reflect the operating results and cash flows for all of our internet sites exclusive of towhnhall 
com 
we also separate our publishing business into two accounting units 
the first publishing accounting unit is the magazine unit  which operates and produces all publications from a stand alone facility  under one general manager  with operating results and cash flows of all publications reported on a combined basis 
the second accounting unit is our book publishing division  xulon press  which also operates from a stand alone facility  under one general manager who is responsible for the separately stated operating results and cash flows 
four of these accounting units have goodwill associated with them as our annual testing period 
we apply a market approach to estimate the fair value of each or our accounting units 
under the market approach  we apply a multiple of six to each accounting units operating income to estimate the fair value 
we believe that a multiple of six is a conservative benchmark based on actual industry transactions 
the first step of our review compares the estimated fair value of each accounting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying amount  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that unit may be impaired 
when we have indication of impairment  we perform a second step to determine the amount of any impairment 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  to determine the enterprise value of one of our accounting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start up 
the key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows december  enterprise valuations discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term revenue growth rate ranges 
table of contents the key assumptions in our third party enterprise valuation varied from the testing period ending december  to the testing period ending december  due to the accounting units for which the enterprise valuations were performed 
due to the nature of the business  publishing varies greatly from our print magazines to our online print on demand digital book publisher and our internet businesses 
based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending december   and the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of our accounting units  including goodwill 
internet and publishing accounting units as of december  percentage range by which enterprise value exceeds carrying value including goodwill to to than number of accounting units enterprise carrying value in thousands based on then deteriorating macro economic factors  including declining magazine industry revenue and a reduction in internet company valuations throughout  we tested the goodwill value in our internet and publishing accounting units for impairment in the second quarter of for the interim testing period ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the value of goodwill in our publishing segment 
the impairments recognized during were driven by negative revenue growth projections and a reduction in cash flows for magazine operations 
the impairments were indicative of a trend in the publishing industry and were not unique to the company 
based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary for goodwill associated with our internet accounting units for the interim testing period ending june  we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  however  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us  or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet  we may recognize future impairment charges  the amount of which may be material 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
upon the adoption of the provisions on january   we had million in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including million recognized under fasb asc topic contingencies and carried forward from prior years and million recognized upon adoption of the tax provision changes as a reduction to retained earnings 
included in the million accrual was million in related interest  net of federal income tax benefits 
during  we recognized a net decrease of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
included in this liability amount were million accrued for the related interest  net of federal income tax benefits  and million for the related penalty recorded in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recognized a net increase of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
included in this liability amount were million accrued for the related interest  net of federal income tax benefits and million for the related penalties recorded in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
a summary of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions based on tax positions related to prior years reductions related to tax positions of prior years decrease due to statute expirations related interest and penalties  net of federal tax benefits balance as of december  
table of contents valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
fair value accounting fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
we adopted the fair value provisions for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january  the adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted fair value provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january  this includes applying the fair value concept to i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations  ii reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing  iii other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments  and iv asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value 
the adoption of the fair value provisions of fasb asc topic to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
pricing observability is affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market  and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
fasb asc topic established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value 
this framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three broad levels of inputs defined by the fasb asc topic hierarchy are as follows level inputs quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
if the asset or liability has a specified contractual term  a level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the reporting entity s own data 
as a result of the adoption of the fair value provisions  we modified the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of our derivative positions 
specifically  we include the impact of our own credit risk on derivative liabilities measured at fair value as defined 
counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to derivatives  such as over the counter derivatives  where the base valuation uses market parameters based on libor interest rate curves 
not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant libor curve  so it is necessary to consider the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an item 
bilateral or own credit risk adjustments are applied to our own credit risk when valuing derivatives measured at fair value 
credit adjustments consider the estimated future cash flows between the company and its counterparties under the terms of the instruments and affect the credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows  rather than a point in time assessment of the current recognized net asset or liability 

table of contents the fair value of our liabilities is impacted by our credit ratings as established by agencies such as moody s investor services moody s and standard poor s s p 
the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities  including the credit risk and all other market variables  was a gain of million for the period ended december  we settled our outstanding swap transactions on december  when we terminated our then existing bank credit facilities  resulting in a loss of million 
the loss represents the difference in the discounted value as estimated in accordance with fasb asc topic and the actual amount the bank was willing to accept in an arms length transaction 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of borrowings under our revolver as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the terms of our credit agreement and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments are required to be made 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates 
stock based compensation we have one stock option plan  the amended and restated stock incentive plan  the plan under which equity awards  including stock options and restricted stock may be granted to employees  consultants and non employee members of the board of the directors of the company 
a maximum of  shares are authorized under the plan  of which  are outstanding and  are exercisable as of december  we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc topic compensation stock compensation 
we record equity awards with stock based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date 
we determine the fair value of our options using the black scholes option pricing model that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
the exercise price for options is equal to the closing market price of salem communications common stock as of the date of grant 
we use the straight line attribution method to recognize share based compensation costs over the expected service period of the award 
upon exercise  cancellation  forfeiture  or expiration of stock options  or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock awards  deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first in  first out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award

senior credit facility on december   our parent company  salem communications corporation entered into the revolver 
we amended the revolver on november  to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million 
the amendment allowed us to use borrowings under the revolver  subject to the available amount as defined by the terms of the credit agreement  to redeem applicable portions of the 
notes 
the calculation of the available amount also pertains to the payment of dividends when the leverage ratio is above to

we incurred million in fees to complete this amendment  which are being amortized over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
the applicable interest rate on the amended credit agreement is libor plus a spread of per annum or the base rate plus a spread of per annum  which is adjusted based on our leverage ratio 
the applicable interest rate prior to the second amendment was libor plus a spread of per annum or the base rate plus a spread of per annum 
if an event of default occurs  the interest rate may increase by per annum

impairment losses on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  indefinite lived intangibles  including broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset over its fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we have incurred significant impairment losses in prior periods with regard to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
these losses  recognized during  were attributable to the following variables used in our assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill balances 
table of contents an increase in the weighted average cost of capital from as of the testing period ended december  to for the testing period ended december   a decline in the estimated terminal or exit values assigned to the licenses as a result of industry wide declines in radio station transaction multiples  a decrease in projected future cash flows from a range of to for the testing period ended december  to a range of to for the testing period ended december   and a significant decline in projected revenues from up to a increase projected at the end of for the year to a decline at the end of for  followed by up to a projected increase in as compared to these losses were also attributable to the following variables used in our assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our mastheads and goodwill associated with our publishing and internet segment an increase in the weighted average cost of capital from as of the testing period ended december  to for the interim testing period ended june   a decline in the estimated terminal or exit values assigned to the assets as a result of industry wide declines in the total number of magazines sold  a decrease in projected future cash flows from for the testing period ended december  to for the interim testing period ended june   and a significant decline in projected profit margins from a range of to as of the december  testing period to a range of to as of the june  interim testing period 
the valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations 
the fair value measurements of our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
if actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used  we are subject to future impairment charges  the amount of which may be material 
given the current economic environment and uncertainties that can negatively impact our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of our indefinite lived intangible fair value estimates will prove to be accurate 
the impairment charges we have recognized are non cash in nature and did violate covenants on our then existing credit facilities or revolver 
however  the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows 
we believe that we have adequately considered the economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  salem did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  salem is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if salem had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the company enters into various agreements in the normal course of business that contain minimum guarantees 
the typical minimum guarantee is tied to future revenue amounts that exceed the contractual level 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these arrangements is zero 

table of contents the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at december   and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations and other loans operating leases on air talent other contracts total contractual cash obligations interest payments on long term debt are based on the outstanding debt and respective interest rates with interest rates on variable rate debt held constant through maturity at the december  rates 
interest ultimately paid on these obligations may differ based on changes in interest rates for variable rate debt  as well as any potential repayments or future refinancing 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details
