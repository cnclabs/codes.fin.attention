a breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the terms of our indebtedness  including the financial covenants under our credit facilities  could result in a default under such indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the lenders for our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to us  and they and the lender of our second lien term loan could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness 
in such case  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations  and our lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities  which is substantially all of our assets 
any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business 
our revolving credit facility also limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  as determined by the lenders in accordance with the credit agreement 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base will be required to be repaid immediately  or we will be required to pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral 
our exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful 
exploration and development activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive quantities of oil  ngls and natural gas will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors  including reductions in oil  ngl and natural gas prices  unexpected drilling conditions

our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend  in part  on data obtained through geological and geophysical analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are uncertain 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying potentially productive hydrocarbon traps and geohazards 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or producible economically 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
because of these factors  we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures 
poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities  and present value calculations may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil  ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil  ngl and natural gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil  ngls and natural gas 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows 
table of contents 
index to financial statements based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an average price  calculated as the twelve month first day of the month historical average price for the twelve month period prior to the end of the reporting period  and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our reserves as of december  were based on the trailing twelve month first day of the month historical unweighted averages of west texas intermediate oil prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials of per bbl and henry hub gas prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials of per mmbtu 
actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
in addition  discounted future net cash flows are estimated assuming royalties to the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement formerly known as the minerals management service of the us department of the interior  royalty owners and other state and federal regulatory agencies with respect to our affected properties  and will be paid or suspended during the life of the properties based upon prices as of the date of the estimate 
the timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor that we use to calculate the standardized measure of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the sec s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry  in general  will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor in arriving at the standardized measure of future net cash flows 
downward revisions of reserves or lower oil and natural gas prices could result in impairments of our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation  on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgment 
the current ceiling calculation utilizes a trailing twelve month first day of the month historical unweighted average price and does not allow for us to re evaluate the calculation subsequent to the end of the period if prices increase 
it also dictates that costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  a write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
it is possible that we may recognize revisions to our proved reserves in the future 
write downs recorded in one period will not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period 
we did not record any write down or impairment for the years ended december  or we recognized a non cash  pre tax ceiling test impairment of million in the first quarter of due to the volatility of commodity prices  however  should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future  it is possible that write downs could occur

government laws and regulations can change 
our activities are subject to federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations 
some of the laws  regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
changes in laws 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and regulations could affect our costs of operations  production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other aspects of our business  including our general profitability 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations 
for example  the epa has recently focused on public concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities 
this renewed focus could lead to additional federal and state regulations affecting the oil and gas industry 
on july   the epa proposed new air emissions regulations targeted primarily at the upstream oil and gas industry 
although  they are expected to be finalized on april  with no phase in period  it is anticipated that they will be challenged by industry associations 
additional regulations or other changes to existing laws and regulations could significantly impact our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
our business requires a staff with technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with technical skills could have a negative effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil  ngl and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil  ngl and natural gas processing and transportation to available markets or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our various products depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil  ngls and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines  terminals and trucking  railroad and or barge transportation and processing facilities 
our ability to market our production also depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines  terminals  other means of transportation and processing facilities 
we may be required to shut in wells or delay production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of gathering systems  pipelines  or other means of transportation or processing facilities 
the transportation of our production may be interrupted under the terms of our interruptible or short term transportation agreements due to capacity constraints on the applicable system 
the transportation of our production may also be interrupted under the terms of our firm long term transportation  terminal and processing agreements due to operational upset  third party force majeure or other events beyond our control 
further  any disruption of third party facilities due to maintenance  repairs  debottlenecking  expansion projects  weather or other interruptions of service could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products 
our concentration of operations in certain geographic areas  such as the eagle ford shale  increases these risks and their potential impact upon us 
if we experience any interruptions to the transportation and or processing of our products  we may be unable to realize revenue from our wells until our production can be tied to a pipeline or gathering system  transported by truck  rail and or barge  or processed  as applicable  into the particular products 
this can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil  ngls and natural gas and realization of revenues 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil  ngls and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our competitors include major and large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties at a lower cost and more quickly than our financial or personnel resources 
table of contents 
index to financial statements permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
our strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player has resulted in operations concentrated in one geographic area and increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein 
currently our operations are highly concentrated in south texas  primarily in the eagle ford shale 
as our largest producing area  this play provided approximately of our total revenue for  excluding the impact of hedging  and represents approximately of our estimated total proved reserves as of december  this concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform 
for example  we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting texas  natural disasters in the geographic area  competition for equipment  services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
if oil and natural gas prices increase in the future  increasing levels of exploration and production could result in response to these stronger prices  and as a result  the demand for oilfield services could rise  and the costs of these services could increase  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in the eagle ford shale  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in this area 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  or well fluids  fires  hurricanes  tropical storms  earthquakes  mud slides  and flooding  pollution  releases of toxic gas  and surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives 

table of contents 
index to financial statements any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties 
we are not fully insured against all risks  including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution  but not for other types of pollution 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our current insurance policies provide some coverage for losses arising out of our hydraulic fracturing operations 
however  these policies may not cover fines  penalties or costs and expenses related to government mandated clean up activities  and total losses related to a spill  contamination or blowout during completion operations could exceed our per occurrence or aggregate policy limits 
furthermore  our current insurance policies do not provide coverage for ground water contamination due to any migration if not discoverable within days  from fractured areas or from leaking associated with inadequate casing or cementing or defective and or inadequate pipe and or casing in the vertical sections of any of our shale wells that traverse aquifers in the locations of our producing properties 
any losses due to hydraulic fracturing that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
regulation and competition of hydraulic fracturing services could impede our ability to develop our shale plays 
hydraulic fracturing activities are required for all of our wells on our shale producing properties located in the eagle ford and southern alberta basin regions in south texas and northwest montana  respectively 
all of our shale properties in these two regions are dependent on our ability to hydraulically fracture the producing formations 
commonly referred to as fracking  hydraulic fracturing is an integral part of the well completion process for all of our shale properties  including all of our exploration and development activities related to these properties 
the fracking involves pumping fluid at high pressure into underground shale formations through steel pipe that is perforated at the location of the hydrocarbons 
the composition of the fluid is generally water and sand or a ceramic material called proppant and less than of highly diluted chemical additives  many of which are commonly found in household items 
the high pressure creates small fractures that allow the oil and gas to flow into the well bore for collection at the surface 
while the majority of the proppant remains wedged underground to prop open the fractures  a percentage of the water and additives flows back from hydraulic fracturing operations 
these fluids are then either recycled onsite or must be transported to and disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by applicable regulatory authorities 
the practice of hydraulic fracturing formations to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community 
various federal  state and local initiatives are underway to regulate  or further investigate  the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing 
for example  both montana and texas have adopted regulations requiring certain hydraulic fracturing disclosures  in august and december of  respectively 
hydraulic fracturing has also generated publicity regarding its potential environmental impact 
although hydraulic fracturing has been largely exempt from the federal safe drinking water act since  bills have been considered in congress that would repeal this exemption 
the adoption of any future federal  state or local laws or regulations imposing additional permitting  disclosure or regulatory 
table of contents 
index to financial statements obligations related to  or otherwise restricting or increasing costs regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult to conduct drilling activity 
as a result  such additional regulations could affect the volume of hydrocarbons we recover  and could increase the cycle times and costs to receive permits  delay or possibly preclude receipt of permits in certain areas  impact water usage and waste water disposal and require air emissions  water usage and chemical additives disclosures 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the proposed legislation and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing  any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and  if the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited or prohibited  could lead to our inability to access existing and new oil and natural gas reserves in the future 
our industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale resource plays which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development 
we engage third party contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services and related services  equipment and supplies 
the availability or high cost of high pressure pumping services or hydraulic fracturing services  chemicals  proppant  water  and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews 
a shortage of service crews or proppant  chemicals  or water  especially if this shortage occurred in south texas or the southern alberta basin  could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget 
hydraulic fracturing operations can result in air emissions  surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination  or ground water contamination by reason of well design and or construction  and a blowout during completion operations when hydraulic services are being provided  could result in personal injury or death and loss or damage to property 
additionally  pre existing or concurrent non company spillage  contamination or property damage could result in litigation  government fines and penalties or remediation or restoration obligations  and damages 
environmental matters and costs can be significant 
the oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean up  remediation  restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
the cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors  including future changes to laws and regulations 
we have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and future growth 
possible regulations related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil  ngls and natural gas 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of the burning of refined oil products and natural gas  are examples of greenhouse gases 
the us congress is considering climate related legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in addition  at least states have developed measures to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
the epa has adopted regulations requiring reporting of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities and is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants under the existing federal clean air act 
in november  the epa adopted rules expanding the industries subject to greenhouse gas reporting to include certain petroleum and natural gas facilities 
these rules require data collection beginning in and reporting beginning in some of our facilities are subject to these rules 
passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various states  or the adoption of other regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies  that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane or carbon dioxide in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas 
our property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make property acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  ability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities  potential lack of operating experience in the geographic market where the acquired properties are located  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements  the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  revenues  capital expenditures  and operating costs  including synergies  a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses  or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate  the incurrence of other significant charges  such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties  asset devaluation  or restructuring charges  and the inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses we acquire 
our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses  and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
also  our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 

table of contents 
index to financial statements derivative transactions may limit our potential revenue  result in financial losses or reduce our income 
we have entered into oil  ngl and natural gas price derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our expected production through these derivative contracts may limit our potential revenue if oil  ngl and natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the contract 
as of december   of our crude oil derivative transactions represented hedged prices of crude oil at the west texas intermediate on the nymex with the remaining at light louisiana sweet  of the total ngl derivative transactions represented hedged prices of ngls at mont belvieu and of total natural gas derivative transactions represented hedged prices of natural gas at the houston ship channel 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative contract  or the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
our current derivative instruments are with counterparties that are lenders in our credit facilities 
our lenders are comprised of banks and financial institutions that could default or fail to perform under our contractual agreements 
a default under any of these agreements could negatively impact our financial performance 
federal legislation regarding derivatives could have an adverse effect on our ability and cost of entering into derivative transactions 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank act which  among other provisions  establishes federal oversight and regulation of the derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the legislation requires the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
cftc rulemaking is ongoing 
some rules have been finalized  while other rules are still in the proposed or earlier stages 
the effect of the rules and any additional regulations on our business is currently uncertain 
of particular concern  the dodd frank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities 
the requirements to be enacted  to the extent applicable to us or our derivatives counterparties  may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge and otherwise manage our financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in oil  ngl and natural gas commodity prices 
any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the impairment of financial institutions or counterparty credit default could adversely affect us 
our commodity derivative transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparties that include commercial banks  investment banks  insurance companies  other investment funds and other institutions 
further deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us 
we may have significant exposure to our derivative counterparties and the value of our derivative positions may provide a significant amount of cash flow 
in addition  if any lender under our revolving credit facility is unable to fund its commitment  our liquidity may be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender s commitment under our revolving credit facility 
currently  no single lender in our credit facility has commitments representing more than of our total commitments 
however  if banks continue to consolidate  we may experience a more concentrated credit risk 
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
among the changes contained in the president s fiscal year budget proposal  released by the white house on february   is the elimination of certain us federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies 
such proposed changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current

recently  members of the us congress have considered similar changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect oil and gas exploration and production companies 
it is unclear  however  whether any such changes will be enacted or  if enacted  how soon such changes would be effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in us federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  we solidified our strategy as an unconventional resource player with the development of our assets in the eagle ford shale in south texas  one of the most active shale plays in the us 
our success in the area resulted in double digit increases in production and a doubling of total proved reserves from the end of these assets also contributed to an overall decrease in our total cost structure and to a more balanced commodity mix with oil and ngls accounting for of the year s production 
our performance in demonstrated the quality of the assets that we have assembled in the eagle ford shale and our technical  commercial and financial abilities to fully realize their value 
the eagle ford shale is our largest producing area and provided approximately of our total production in our primary focus has been the development of our  acre gates ranch acreage in webb county where we have completed wells as of december  we plan to continue development of gates ranch in we have also announced our intention to increase our well density to acre spacing from the past practice of drilling on acre spacing 
we believe this may result in increased recovery of hydrocarbons from this field 
during the year  we also tested with positive results three new eagle ford areas across  net acres in the liquids windows outside gates ranch 
the newly delineated acreage expands our already strong liquids rich position  and we intend to begin development of these areas  as well as to evaluate an additional  acres in the liquids windows in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the success of our eagle ford drilling program was the basis for a significant increase in reserve estimates for the year 
as of december   our estimated proved reserves were mmboe bcfe  a increase from our estimate of mmboe bcfe as of december  with our new production base in the eagle ford shale  we continued to shift our production portfolio to higher levels of oil and ngls 
for the month ended december   more than of our production was from oil and ngls 
this trend reduced our exposure to current low natural gas prices 
approximately of the reserves that we have discovered in the eagle ford shale are liquids 
in  our average annual production rate was mboe d mmcfe d and we exited with a production rate of mboe d mmcfe d 
year over year  we achieved a increase in our annual production despite several major divestitures of legacy natural gas assets that no longer fit our unconventional resource strategy 
during the year  we completed the sale of properties in the dj basin in colorado and in the sacramento basin in california for million  less customary closing adjustments 
the proceeds were utilized to reduce our debt  and the balance was redeployed to take advantage of higher return opportunities in our eagle ford shale program 
as we streamlined our business  we finalized the reorganization of our houston staff to consolidate all of our technical resources in one location 
the timely and efficient development of our eagle ford resources has been challenging in a region where midstream services are in high demand and infrastructure is under construction 
in response  we have diligently worked to secure long term contracts for firm transportation and processing capacity to meet our growing production demand 
we now have access to four separate processing facilities which gives us more flexibility to manage service issues 
we also have agreements in place that will increase our current eagle ford firm daily gas transportation and processing capacity from mmcf d to mmcf d of gross wellhead production contracted to be available by the middle of total firm capacity of mmcf d is contracted to be available in early the overall performance of our business has been greatly improved with our success in the eagle ford shale 
our average revenue increased by per boe in compared to the previous year primarily due to significant growth in higher valued oil and ngl production 
for  approximately of our overall production mix was attributable to oil and ngl production compared to a year ago 
our effective cost control and divestiture of certain assets also resulted in a decrease in lease operating expense  which declined to per boe in from per boe in our other shale focus area lies in the southern alberta basin in northwest montana 
we control approximately  net acres in the exploration play to test the economic potential in the banff  bakken  and three forks reservoirs 
in late  we began an eleven well vertical drilling program that was completed during the second quarter of the results from that initiative contributed to the design of a seven well horizontal drilling program that is currently underway 
as of december   four wells have been drilled and the remaining three wells will be drilled in the initial test results from the two wells completed and evaluated at year end confirmed the complexity of the play and the need for continued evaluation by us and the industry 
our business goals for are based on an announced capital program of million with more than allocated to the evaluation and development of our eagle ford assets  which are expected to deliver significant production growth year over year 
our plans for include a four rig program in the eagle ford shale and the completion of new wells located both in the gates ranch area  as well as in other liquids areas of the play 
based on current development plans  market conditions and our understanding of the play  we expect the eagle ford shale program to be self funding by the end of approximately of the capital funds will be spent for leasehold costs and continued evaluation of the southern alberta basin 
in addition to our focus on execution in the eagle ford  we will also begin to evaluate new opportunities to drive the long term growth and sustainability of rosetta 
we will continue our strategy of looking at unconventional resources which will provide a viable inventory of projects 
we expect these opportunities will be a blend of new higher risk exploration  as well as producing property acquisitions

index to financial statements lease operating expense 
lease operating expense in decreased to million  or  from million in  which was a decrease of from million in the decrease in both and was primarily due to our divestiture activities  such as our divestitures of our sacramento basin assets in california and our dj basin assets in colorado as well as the divestiture of our gulf coast sabine lake asset  and our overall lease operating expense reduction efforts

treating and transportation 
treating and transportation expense in increased to million  or  from million in  which was an increase of from million in the increase was a result of increased production primarily in the eagle ford shale  where infrastructure is still under construction and transportation and processing capacity is in high demand 
production taxes 
production taxes are highly correlated to unhedged revenues and stronger commodity prices have impacted results for this expense item 
production taxes as a percentage of unhedged oil  ngl and natural gas sales were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to certain production tax credits in the state of texas 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
dd a expense in increased to million  or  from million in  which was a decrease of from million in the increase in was due to a increase in total production  as well as a lower dd a rate as a result of a increase in reserves due to significant additions of proved reserves primarily in the gates ranch area 
the decrease in was due to a decrease in total production and a lower dd a rate for as compared to due to the full cost ceiling test impairment charges recognized in the first quarter of  which decreased the carrying value of our full cost pool 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
based on quarterly ceiling test computations using twelve month first day of the month historical average prices  adjusted for hedges of oil and natural gas  we were not required to record a write down at december  or  and no write down occurred during or however  based on the quarterly ceiling test computations using hedge adjusted market prices during  the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling and we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment expense of million 
general and administrative costs 
general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  increased by million in from the increase in was primarily related to a million increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of our increased stock price and incentive compensation related to performance share units  a million increase in consultant costs related to various internal projects and divestiture activities and an increase of million of other administrative costs  offset by a decrease of million in salaries  wages and bonuses due to lower headcount as a result of closing the denver office 
in  general and administrative costs  net of capitalized exploration and development overhead costs of million  increased by million from the increase in was primarily related to a million increase in stock based compensation due to our increased stock price  a million increase in salaries  wages and bonuses and a million increase in benefit costs  offset by a million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses that were capitalized and a million decrease of other administrative costs 
total other expense total other expense includes interest expense  net of interest capitalized  interest income and other income expense  net which decreased million in from the decrease in total other expense was primarily due to our repayment of million under the restated revolver in april resulting in lower interest expense and an increase in capitalized interest resulting from an increase in our weighted average interest rate 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the weighted average interest rate of in was higher than the rate of due to the higher interest rate associated with the senior notes  which were issued in april for  total other expense increased million from the increase in total other expense was primarily due to an increase in interest expense associated with higher amounts of outstanding debt 
long term debt outstanding as of december  was million higher as compared to december  the weighted average interest rate of in was higher than the rate of due to the higher interest rate associated with the senior notes 
provision for income taxes our income tax expense was million 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate was compared to the effective tax rate of for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes differs from the taxes computed at the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to the effect of state taxes  the non deductibility of certain incentive compensation and a valuation allowance against certain state deferred tax assets 
the company provides for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million  compared to a net deferred tax asset of approximately million at december   resulting primarily from the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties and net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent  in part  on generating sufficient taxable income from the production of oil and natural gas properties prior to the expiration of loss carryforwards 
in connection with the asset divestitures in the dj basin in colorado and in the sacramento basin in california  the company concluded in that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for these states including nols would not be realized 
therefore  valuation allowances were established for these items as well as state nols in other jurisdictions in which the company previously operated but had since divested of operating assets 
in  the company released million of valuation allowance to reflect revised estimates of the utilization of state nols against gains on sale of assets in some states 
the company will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available evidence obtained in future reporting periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity and capital is our operating cash flow and cash on hand 
we also maintain a revolving line of credit  which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow 
operating cash flow 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil  ngls and natural gas and the success of our development and exploration activities as well as future acquisitions 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by executing derivative transactions to hedge the change in prices of a portion of our production  thereby mitigating our exposure to price declines  but these transactions may also limit our earnings potential in periods of rising commodity prices 
the effects of these derivative transactions on our oil  ngl and natural gas sales are discussed above under results of operations revenues 
the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels 
economic conditions and lower commodity prices could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity 
we will continue to monitor our cash flow and liquidity and  if appropriate  we may consider adjusting our capital expenditure program

index to financial statements senior secured revolving credit facility 
on may   we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated senior revolving credit agreement the restated revolver 
under this amendment  among other things  our senior secured revolving line of credit was increased from million to million and the term of the restated revolver was extended from july  to may  availability under the restated revolver is restricted to the borrowing base  which is subject to review and adjustment on a semi annual basis and other interim adjustments  including adjustments based on our hedging arrangements as well as asset divestitures 
the amount of the borrowing base is affected by a number of factors  including our level of reserves  as well as the pricing outlook at the time of the redetermination 
therefore  a significant reduction in capital spending could result in a reduced level of reserves that could cause a reduction in the borrowing base 
we utilized a portion of the proceeds from our asset divestitures to repay million of outstanding debt under the restated revolver on april  as of december   we had million outstanding with million of available borrowing capacity under the restated revolver 
amounts outstanding under the restated revolver bear interest at specified margins over the london interbank offered rate libor of to

as of december   we had total outstanding borrowings of million and for the year ended december   our weighted average borrowing rate was 
working capital our working capital fluctuates primarily as a result of changes in commodity pricing and production volumes  capital spending to fund our exploratory and development initiatives and the impact of our outstanding derivative instruments 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  the decrease in our working capital was largely due to increased liabilities associated with royalty payables resulting from increased production and higher commodity prices  increased capital spending primarily in the eagle ford shale  increased accrued compensation associated with the performance share units that are to be cash settled and a decrease in the fair value of short term commodity derivative positions 
we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
cash flows year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
key drivers of net cash provided by operating activities are commodity prices  production volumes and costs and expenses  which primarily include operating costs  taxes other than income taxes  transportation  interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities continued to be a primary source of liquidity and capital used to finance our capital expenditures in cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to this increase was largely due to higher oil and ngl prices and increased oil and ngl production during compared to cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to this increase was largely due to higher oil  ngl and natural gas prices and increased oil and ngl production during compared to investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spending  net of divestiture proceeds 

table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million in as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to net asset divestiture proceeds of million offset by expenditures of million for purchases to develop oil and natural gas assets

in  we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures as compared to approximately million in during  we participated in the drilling of gross wells as compared to the drilling of gross wells in financing activities 
the primary drivers of cash used in provided by financing activities are borrowings and repayments under the restated revolver  equity transactions associated with the exercise of stock options and the acquisition of treasury shares from employees and directors to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million in as compared to the net increase was primarily related to the million repayment under the restated revolver in april and the net impact of the million issuance of our senior notes  net repayments under the restated revolver of million and repayment of million under the restated term loan in cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million in as compared to the net increase was primarily related to the activities in noted above and the net repayment of million under the restated revolver in commodity price risk and related derivative activities the energy markets have historically been very volatile and oil  ngl and natural gas prices will be subject to wide fluctuations in the future 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices  management hedges oil  ngl and natural gas prices from time to time  primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments  including fixed price swaps  basis swaps  nymex roll swaps  costless collars and put options 
although not risk free  we believe these activities will reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations and thereby enable us to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
consistent with this policy  we have entered into a series of oil  ngl and natural gas fixed price swaps  basis swaps  nymex roll swaps and costless collars for each year through our fixed price swap  basis swap  nymex roll swap and costless collar agreements require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a notional quantity of oil  ngls and natural gas  as applicable  without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments were based on expected production from existing wells at inception of the derivative instruments

for  excludes approximately million of realized gains associated with the termination of derivatives used to hedge production from our divested pinedale properties 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivatives  all derivative instruments  unless designated as a normal purchase and normal sale  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of these hedging transactions on a quarterly basis  consistent with the documented risk management strategy for the particular hedging relationship 
gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
our crude oil basis and nymex roll swap derivative instruments do not qualify as cash flow hedges and are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values under derivative instruments  as assets and or liabilities  as applicable  and are marked to market each period with the change in fair value representing unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately as a component of oil sales 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility that can be significant from period to period  but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
the cash flow impact occurs when the settlement of the underlying contract occurs 
as of december   our commodity hedge and non qualifying derivative instruments are with counterparties that are also lenders under our credit facilities 
this allows us to satisfy any need for any margin obligation resulting from a negative change in the fair market value of the derivative contracts with the collateral securing our credit facilities  thus eliminating the need for independent collateral postings 
as of december   we had no deposits for collateral in regard to our commodity derivative instruments 
effective january   we have elected to de designate all of our commodity contracts that had previously been designated as cash flow hedges as of december   and we have elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of million million after tax of unrealized gains  representing the mark to market value of the company s cash flow hedges as of the balance sheet date 
as a result of discontinuing hedge accounting  such mark to market values that are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the de designation date will be frozen and reclassified into earnings in future periods as the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings 
we expect to reclassify into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income the frozen value related to de designated commodity cash flow hedges over the next two years
