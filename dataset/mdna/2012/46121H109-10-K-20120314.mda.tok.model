during the second quarter of  intricon submitted the centauri  its first generation cdm device  for k approval with the food and drug administration fda 
the company received fda approval in august of the features of the centauri ecg monitor are event recording combined with wireless transmission of the patient data to a remote service center  which then forwards the information to the doctor 
the sirona  a cdm device which incorporates physiolink technology  was submitted for k approval in the third quarter of the company received fda approval in november of the sirona electrocardiogram ecg platform is essentially two products in one design since it can be used as an event recorder and a holter monitor 
this platform is very small  rechargeable  and water spray proof 
the company is working to incorporate both the centauri and sirona devices into the customized software packages of future customers and believes the devices will drive further gains in latter in addition  intricon manufactures and supplies bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system 
intricon also manufactures a family of safety needle products for an original equipment manufacturing oem customer that utilizes intricon s insert and straight molding capabilities 
these products are assembled using full automation  including built in quality checks within the production lines 
hearing health intricon manufactures hybrid amplifiers and integrated circuit components hybrid amplifiers  along with faceplates for in the ear and in the canal hearing instruments 
intricon is a leading manufacturer and supplier of microminiature electromechanical components to hearing instrument manufacturers 
these components consist of volume controls  microphones  receivers  trimmer potentiometers and switches 
components are offered in a variety of sizes  colors and capacities in order to accommodate a hearing instrument manufacturer s individualized specifications 
hearing instruments  which fit behind or in a person s ear to amplify and process sound for a hearing impaired person  generally are composed of four basic parts and several supplemental components for control or fitting purposes 
the four basic parts are microphones  amplifier circuits  miniature receivers speakers and batteries  all of which intricon manufactures  with the exception of the battery 
intricon s hybrid amplifiers are a type of amplifier circuit 
supplemental components include volume controls  trimmer potentiometers  which shape sound frequencies to respond to the particular nature of a person s hearing loss  and switches used to turn the instrument on and off and to go from telephone to normal speech modes 
faceplates and an ear shell  molded to fit the user s ear  often serve as housing for hearing instruments 
intricon manufactures its components on a short lead time basis in order to supply just in time delivery to its customers and  consequently  order backlog amounts are not meaningful 

table of contents based on our investments in core technologies  specifically nanodsp and our new wireless physiolink technologies  intricon is building a new generation of affordable  high quality hearing aids and similar amplifier devices under contracts for oem s 
dsp devices have better clarity  attractive pricing points and an improved ability to filter out background noise 
during we introduced the overtus dsp amplifier 
the overtus dsp amplifier is designed to optimize open in the canal itc type fittings 
the amplifier algorithm contains two patented features  an advanced adaptive feedback canceller  reliant clear  optimized for open itc fittings and an acoustic switch  acoustap  eliminating the need for a mechanical switch and allowing for further miniaturization 
further  with the overtus technology  we have developed our own complete hearing device  the all new  patent pending apt open itc 
the apt is powered by the overtus which includes our reliant clear adaptive feedback canceller and the acoustap acoustic push button 
in addition  the apt utilizes the patent pending concha lock system technology that allows for the suspension of an open in the ear device in the ear canal 
these features create stable and effective amplification  occlusion free comfort and easy integration into existing fitting systems 
our oem customers now have the option of using overtus in their own devices  or purchasing our complete apt device 
we believe the introductions of the apt and lumen devices and the overtus amplifier will solidify our position as a leader of high performance adaptive dsp hearing instrument amplifiers 
furthermore  we believe our strategic alliance with dynamic hearing will allow us to develop new body worn applications and further expand both our hearing health and professional audio product portfolio 
in october  the company announced it has entered into a manufacturing agreement to become a manufacturer of hearing aids to hi healthinnovations  a unitedhealth group company 
hi healthinnovations launched a suite of high tech  lower cost hearing devices for the estimated million americans with hearing loss 
an estimated percent of people who can benefit from hearing devices do not use them  largely due to the high cost 
hi healthinnovations will offer consumers technically advanced hearing aids  including those based on the apt hearing aid platform 
overall  we believe the hearing health market holds significant opportunities for the company 
in the united states  europe and japan  the year old plus age demographic is one of the fastest growing segments of the population  and many of those individuals could  at some point  benefit from a hearing device that uses intricon s proprietary technology 
professional audio communications intricon entered the high quality audio communication device market in  and now has a line of miniature  professional audio headset products used by customers focusing on homeland security and emergency response needs

the company is committed to increasing its investment in the research and development of proprietary technologies  such as the ulp nanodsp and ulp wireless technologies 
the company believes the continued development of key proprietary technologies will be the catalyst for long term revenues and margin growth 
research and development expenditures were   and  in  and  respectively 
these amounts are net of customer and grant reimbursed research and development 
intricon owns a number of united states patents which cover a number of product designs and processes 
the company believes that  although these patents collectively add value to the company  the costs associated with the submission of patent applications are expensed as incurred given the uncertainty of the patents providing future economic benefit to the company 
regulation 
a large portion of our business operates in a marketplace subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the design control  development  manufacturing  labeling  record keeping  and surveillance procedures for medical devices 
united states food and drug administration fda regulations classify medical devices based on perceived risk to public health as either class i  ii or iii devices 
class i devices are subject to general controls  class ii devices are subject to special controls and class iii devices are subject to pre market approval pma requirements 
while most class i devices are exempt from pre market submission  it is necessary for most class ii devices to be cleared by a k pre market notification prior to marketing 
k establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device which was legally marketed prior to may  or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent  through the k process  after may  it is substantially equivalent if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate 
the k pre market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the fda 
the process of obtaining a k clearance typically can take several months to a year or longer 
if the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established  the fda will require the manufacturer to submit a pma application for a class iii device that must be reviewed and approved by the fda prior to sale and marketing of the device in the united states 
the process of obtaining pma approval can be expensive  uncertain  lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of fda submission  if approval is obtained at all 
the fda controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses 
the fda can withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks 
our hearing aid devices are class i medical devices  exempt from the k submission process 
they are typically marketed to fda approved manufacturers with intricon assisting in the design  development and production 
our ecg recorder devices are classified as class ii medical devices and have received k marketing clearance from the fda 
our manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the fda  whose primary purpose is to audit the company s compliance with the quality system regulations published by the fda and other applicable government standards 
strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to audit deficiencies or to product performance problems 
we believe that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the requirements of the fda regulations and this has been substantiated with no findings cited during our most recent fda audit in april of recent concerns have been raised by the public  internal fda staff and congress as to whether the current fda k program achieves its goals of making safe and effective devices available to the public while also fostering innovation 
in august  the fda center for devices and radiological health cdrh released two major fda reports recommending changes to be taken by cdrh 
the first report provides recommendations on how to strengthen the k program and the second report provided recommendations on how to incorporate new scientific information into regulatory decision making 
the recommendations were adopted in and are not anticipated to have a significant impact on the company 
in addition  the fda has requested that the institute of medicine conduct an independent study of the k program on whether legislative  regulatory or administrative changes are needed 
international regulation international regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging and labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax 
many of these regulations are similar to those of the fda 
we believe we are in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed 

table of contents the registration system for our medical devices in the eu requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to essential requirements set forth by the medical device directive mdd 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which our ecg recorder devices are produced are inspected and audited by our international organization for standardization iso registrar british standards institute bsi 
these devices are tested and certified by nemko norges elektriske material kontroll an independent norwegian company 
our authorized representative  ce partner u  maintains our technical file and registers our products with competent authorities in all eu member states 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which all of our other medical devices are produced are inspected and audited by the bsi 
these audits verify our compliance with the essential requirements of the mdd 
these certifying bodies verify that our quality system conforms to the international quality standard iso and that our products conform to the essential requirements and supplementary requirements set forth by the mdd for the class of medical devices we produce 
these certifying bodies also certify our conformity with both the quality standards and the mdd requirements  entitling us to place the ce mark on all of our ecg recorder devices 
our hearing aid devices typically bear the ce mark of our customers who assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices 
third party reimbursement the availability and level of reimbursement from third party payers for procedures utilizing our products is significant to our business 
our products are purchased primarily by oem customers who sell into clinics  hospitals and other end users  who in turn bill various third party payers for the services provided to the patients 
these payers  which include medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans and managed care organizations  reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures utilizing our products 
in response to the national focus on rising health care costs  a number of changes to reduce costs have been proposed or have begun to emerge 
there have been  and may continue to be  proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payers to curb these costs 
the development or increased use of more cost effective treatments for diseases could cause such payers to decrease or deny reimbursement for surgeries or devices to favor alternatives that do not utilize our products 
a significant number of americans enroll in some form of managed care plan 
higher managed care utilization typically drives down the payments for health care procedures  which in turn places pressure on medical supply prices 
this causes hospitals to implement tighter vendor selection and certification processes  by reducing the number of vendors used  purchasing more products from fewer vendors and trading discounts on price for guaranteed higher volumes to vendors 
hospitals have also sought to control and reduce costs over the last decade by joining group purchasing organizations or purchasing alliances 
we cannot predict what continuing or future impact these practices  the existing or proposed legislation  or such third party payer measures within a constantly changing healthcare landscape may have on our future business  financial condition or results of operations

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the risks events actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of future operations could be materially adversely affected 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our results of operations  which could adversely affect us 
factors that affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the global economy and financial markets  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of our products and our customer s products  competitive pricing pressures  global currency valuations  the availability of electronic components that we purchase from suppliers  our ability to meet demand  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  changing customer requirements  delays in new product qualifications  and the timing and extent of research and development expenses 
these factors have caused and may continue to cause us to experience fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly and or annual basis 
these fluctuations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  which in turn  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are dependent on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues 
in fiscal year  our largest customer accounted for approximately percent of our net sales and our five largest customers accounted for approximately percent of our net sales 
a significant decrease in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of customers to develop and sell products that incorporate our products 
no assurance can be given that our major customers will not experience financial  technical or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and  in turn  our results of operations 
we may not be able to collect outstanding accounts receivable from our customers 
some of our customers purchase our products on credit  which may cause a concentration of accounts receivable among some of our customers 
as of december   we had accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  of  which represented approximately percent of our shareholders equity as of that date 
as of that date  one customer accounted for approximately percent of our accounts receivable 
our financial condition and profitability may be harmed if one or more of our customers are unable or unwilling to pay these accounts receivable when due 
there are risks under our manufacturing agreement with hi healthinnovations 
in  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with hi healthinnovations  a unitedhealth group company  to supply hearing aids 
under the agreement  we are required to establish and maintain a certain level of manufacturing  supply chain and delivery capacity 
we devoted considerable time  resources and capital during to securing the agreement and preparing for the program s launch 
hi healthinnovations is not required to purchase any minimum amount under the manufacturing agreement and may cease purchases at any time 
we also agreed that during the term of the agreement  we would not sell hearing aids or accessories to another health insurer or directly to consumers 
for more information  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on november  despite signs of improvement in economic conditions  the current domestic economic environment could cause a severe disruption in our operations 
our business has been negatively impacted by the current domestic economic environment 
if this environment is prolonged or worsens  there could be several severely negative implications to our business that may exacerbate many of the risk factors we identified including  but not limited to  the following liquidity the domestic economic environment and the associated credit crisis could continue or worsen and reduce liquidity and this could have a negative impact on financial institutions and the country s financial system  which could  in turn  have a negative impact on our business 
we may not be able to borrow additional funds under our existing credit facility and may not be able to expand our existing facility if our lender becomes insolvent or its liquidity is limited or impaired or if we fail to meet covenant levels going forward 
in addition  we may not be able to renew our existing credit facility at the conclusion of its current term or renew it on terms that are favorable to us 

table of contents demand the current recession has resulted in lower sales by our customers 
additionally  our customers may not have access to sufficient cash or short term credit to obtain our products or services 
prices certain markets have experienced and may continue to experience deflation  which would negatively impact our average prices and reduce our margins 
if we are unable to continue to develop new products that are inexpensive to manufacture  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to continue to achieve our historical profit margins due to advancements in technology 
the ability to continue our profit margins is dependent upon our ability to stay competitive by developing products that are technologically advanced and inexpensive to manufacture 
our need for continued investment in research and development may increase expenses and reduce our profitability 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
if we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of the need to maintain or increase spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development  our operating results could be materially harmed if our research and development efforts fail to result in new products or if revenues fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our commitment to invest in research and development  management believes that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in the future 
we operate in a highly competitive business and if we are unable to be competitive  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
several of our competitors have been able to offer more standardized and less technologically advanced hearing and professional audio communication products at lower prices 
price competition has had an adverse effect on our sales and margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our technical capabilities or compete successfully with our existing and future competitors 
merger and acquisition activity in our hearing health market has resulted in a smaller customer base 
reliance on fewer customers may have an adverse effect on us 
several of our customers in the hearing health market have undergone mergers or acquisitions  resulting in a smaller customer base with larger customers 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with the reduced customer base  it may adversely affect our operating profits and revenue 
unfavorable legislation in the hearing health market may decrease the demand for our products  and may negatively impact our financial condition 
in some of our foreign markets  government subsidies cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids 
a change in legislation that would reduce or eliminate these subsidies could decrease the demand for our hearing health products 
this could result in an adverse effect on our operating results 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of any such legislation 
our failure to obtain required governmental approvals and maintain regulatory compliance for our required products would impact our ability to generate revenue from those products 
the markets in which our business operates are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the design control  development  manufacturing  labeling  record keeping  and surveillance procedures for our medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance or approvals from the fda for new products and new applications for existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearance approvals will be granted  or that the fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect our ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
some of our products in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval process with the fda 
the fda has the authority to control the indicated uses of a device 
products can also be withdrawn from the market due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems 
the fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect us 

table of contents the registration system for our medical devices in the eu requires that our quality system conform to international quality standards 
manufacturing facilities and processes under which our ecg recorder devices are produced are inspected and audited by various certifying bodies 
these audits verify our compliance with applicable requirements and standards 
further  the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect our facilities to determine whether we are in compliance with various regulations relating to quality systems  such as manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control  product labeling and product surveillance 
a determination that we are in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls or product seizures  suspensions or shutdown of production and  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions  depending on the nature of the violation 
implementation of our growth strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase revenues 
our growth strategy includes developing new products and entering new markets  as well as identifying and integrating acquisitions 
our ability to compete in new markets will depend upon a number of factors including  among others our ability to create demand for products in new markets  our ability to manage growth effectively  our ability to successfully identify  complete and integrate acquisitions  our ability to respond to changes in our customers businesses by updating existing products and introducing  in a timely fashion  new products which meet the needs of our customers  the quality of our new products  and our ability to respond rapidly to technological change 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may face competition in these new markets from various companies that may have substantially greater research and development resources  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations 
we have foreign operations in singapore  indonesia and germany  and various factors relating to our international operations could affect our results of operations 
in  we operated in singapore  indonesia and germany 
approximately percent of our revenues were derived from our facilities in these countries in as of december  approximately percent of our long lived assets are located in these countries 
political or economic instability in these countries could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to diminished revenues in these countries 
our future revenues  costs of operations and profit results could be affected by a number of factors related to our international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in economic conditions from country to country  changes in a country s political condition  trade protection measures  licensing and other legal requirements and local tax issues 
unanticipated currency fluctuations in the euro and other currencies could lead to lower reported consolidated revenues due to the translation of this currency into us dollars when we consolidate our revenues and results from operations 
the recent recessions in europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those geographies 
the continuing debt crisis in certain european countries could cause the value of the euro to deteriorate  reducing the purchasing power of our european customers 
financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers  including distributors  could result in product delays and inventory issues  risks to accounts receivable could also include delays in collection and greater bad debt expense 
also  the effect of the debt crisis in certain european countries could have an adverse affect on the capital markets generally  specifically impacting our ability and the ability of our customers to finance our and their respective businesses on acceptable terms  if at all  the availability of materials and supplies and demand for our products 
we may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business 
we may not be able to complete these transactions and these transactions  if executed  pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement  enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities 
we may have difficulty finding these opportunities or  if we do identify these opportunities  we may not be able to complete the transactions for various reasons  including a failure to secure financing 
any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks  including the diversion of our management s attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture  possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process  unanticipated liabilities  and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate  operate  maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees 
in addition  future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt 

table of contents we may experience difficulty in paying our debt when it comes due  which could limit our ability to obtain financing 
as of december   we had bank indebtedness of  and additional indebtedness of payable to the former shareholder of datrix 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by general economic conditions and by financial  competitive  political  business and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that availability under our existing credit facility combined with funds expected to be generated from operations and control of capital spending will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operating needs for at least the next months 
if  however  we are unable to renew these facilities or obtain waivers see liquidity and capital resources in the future or do not generate sufficient cash or complete such financings on a timely basis  we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing  additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets  as well as our own financial condition and performance 
if we fail to meet our financial and other covenants under our loan agreements with our lenders  absent a waiver  we will be in default of the loan agreements and our lenders can take actions that would adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants in our loan agreements 
in the event we are unable to comply with these covenants during future periods  it is uncertain whether our lenders will grant waivers for our non compliance 
if there is an event of default by us under our loan agreements  our lenders have the option to  among other things  accelerate any and all of our obligations under the loan agreements which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our senior management team and if we are not able to retain them  it could have a materially adverse effect on us 
we are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team  including mark s 
gorder  our president  chief executive officer and director 
we depend on the services of mr 
gorder and the other members of our senior management team to  among other things  continue the development and implementation of our business strategies and maintain and develop our client relationships 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any members of our senior management team 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our engineering and technical personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our markets 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development and growth of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
the failure to retain and recruit key technical personnel could cause additional expense  potentially reduce the efficiency of our operations and could harm our business 
we and or our customers may be unable to protect our and their proprietary technology and intellectual property rights or keep up with that of competitors 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our markets depends  in part  on our ability and the ability of our customers to protect our and their current and future proprietary technology under patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and unfair competition laws 
we cannot assure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate  or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around the proprietary rights we own or license 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs in attempting to protect our proprietary rights 
also  despite the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our and our customers products  develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we or our customers regard as proprietary 
we and our customers may be unable to successfully identify or prosecute unauthorized uses of our or our customers technology 
if we become subject to material intellectual property infringement claims  we could incur significant expenses and could be prevented from selling specific products 
we may become subject to material claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future 
we cannot assure that  if made  these claims will not be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management from other business 
any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products 

table of contents environmental liability and compliance obligations may affect our operations and results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations as well as internal programs and policies governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the storage  use  handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and chemicals  and employee health and safety 
if violations of environmental laws occur  we could be held liable for damages  penalties  fines and remedial actions 
our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws  as well as any required material modifications arising from new regulations that may be enacted in the future 
we may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or former businesses or businesses we acquire 
in addition  it is possible that we may be held liable for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities 
we are subject to numerous asbestos related lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant along with a number of other parties in lawsuits alleging that plaintiffs have or may have contracted asbestos related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos products or equipment containing asbestos sold by one or more named defendants 
these lawsuits relate to the discontinued heat technologies segment which we sold in march due to the noninformative nature of the complaints  we do not know whether any of the complaints state valid claims against us 
certain insurance carriers have informed us that the primary policies for the period august   have been exhausted and that the carriers will no longer provide a defense under those policies 
we have requested that the carriers substantiate this situation 
we believe we have additional policies available for other years which have been ignored by the carriers 
because settlement payments are applied to all years a litigant was deemed to have been exposed to asbestos  we believe when settlement payments are applied to these additional policies  we will have availability under the years deemed exhausted 
if our insurance policies do not cover the costs and any awards for the asbestos related lawsuits  we will have to use our cash or obtain additional financing to pay the asbestos related obligations and settlement costs 
there is no assurance that we will have the cash or be able to obtain additional financings on favorable terms to pay asbestos related obligations or settlements should they occur 
the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty 
in light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos lawsuits  there is no guarantee that these lawsuits will not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile  which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want to and at prices they find attractive 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile  and there has been limited trading volume in our common stock 
the common stock market price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results  the timing and announcement of sales or acquisitions of assets by us or our competitors  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  adverse or unfavorable publicity about our products  technologies or us  the commencement of material litigation  or an unfavorable verdict  against us  terrorist attacks  war and threats of attacks and war  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
such volatility and decline has affected many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad fluctuations and limited trading volume may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  and your ability to sell our common stock 
most of our outstanding shares are available for resale in the public market without restriction 
the sale of a large number of these shares could adversely affect the share price and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or make acquisitions for common stock 

table of contents anti takeover provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions in pennsylvania law and our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
these provisions could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could reduce the amount that shareholders might receive if we are sold 
for example  our charter provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without shareholder approval 
in addition  our bylaws provide for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
directors may be removed by shareholders only with the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of all of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote 
further  under an agreement that we entered into with hi healthinnovations  a unitedhealth group company  in connection with our manufacturing agreement  we are required to  among other things  offer to united healthcare services  inc the right to complete the acquisition of our company by a health insurer on the same terms and conditions and the right to participate in certain other sales of our company  all of which may have an anti takeover effect 
for more information  see our current report on form k filed with the sec on november  if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential shareholders and customers could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business  the trading price of our stock and our ability to retain our current customers or obtain new customers 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  referred to as section  we are required to include in our annual reports on form k  our management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
currently  we are not required to include a report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls because we are a smaller reporting company under sec rules  therefore  shareholders do not have the benefit of an independent review of our internal controls 
while we have reported no material weaknesses in the form k for the fiscal year ended december   we cannot guarantee that we will not have material weaknesses reported by our management in the future 
compliance with the requirements of section is expensive and time consuming 
if in the future we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner  or if we determine that we have a material weakness  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  any failure to establish an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential investors and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the securities exchange act of  which could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock

table of contents results of operations compared with consolidated net sales our net sales are comprised of three main markets medical  hearing health  and professional audio collectively our body worn device segment 
below is a recap of our sales by main markets for the years ended december  and change dollars percent medical hearing health professional audio communications consolidated net sales in  we experienced a percent decrease medical sales primarily due to extended regulatory lead times and anticipated fluctuations in demand 
the persisting economic softness and regulatory delays has caused many patients to defer discretionary medical procedures  and hospitals and doctors to cut back on purchases of legacy med tech products 
as a result  during the course of  a few large medical customers experienced fluctuations in demand 
as the year progressed  we were encouraged by the reengagement of medtronic and other key medical customers  driving four quarters of sequential growth 
management believes there is an industry wide trend toward further miniaturization and ambulatory monitoring enabled by wireless connectivity  referred to as bio telemetry  which in the past resulted in further growth in our medical business 
additionally  we are actively involved with medtronic for future development of next generation products 
we are also working with our strategic partner  ame  on proprietary bio telemetry technologies that will enable us to develop new devices that connect patients and care givers  providing critical information and feedback 
net sales in our hearing health business for the year ended december  remained flat compared to the same period in driven by growth in our dsp circuits and sales to hi healthinnovations  offset by temporary declines in legacy products 
we believe long term prospects in our hearing health business remain strong as we continue to develop and launch advanced technologies  such as our nanodsp  overtus  apt and lumen products  which will enhance the performance of hearing devices 
in addition  we believe that the hi healthinnovations agreement holds tremendous potential 
further  we believe the market indicators in the hearing health industry  including the aging world population  suggest long term industry growth 
net sales to the professional audio device sector decreased percent in compared to the same period in we believe that the primary driver of the decrease was due to the possible us government shutdown and budgetary approval process which delayed our contract product launches with certain government organizations 
we believe our extensive portfolio of communication devices that are portable  smaller and perform well in noisy or hazardous environments will provide for future long term growth in this market 
gross profit gross profit  both in dollars and as a percent of sales  for and  were as follows change dollars percent of sales dollars percent of sales dollars percent gross profit in  gross profit decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes  costs related to establishing the company s indonesian facility and ramp up costs associated with the hi healthinnovations agreement

if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash from operations  or if we incur additional unanticipated liabilities  we may be required to seek additional financing or sell equity or debt on terms which may not be as favorable as we could have otherwise obtained 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing  additional borrowing or sale of equity or debt will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and equity capital markets  as well as our own financial condition 
while management believes that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next months  no assurance can be given that we will be able to do so

new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k  for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
certain accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their importance to the consolidated financial statements and possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly 
the accounting policies of the company with significant estimates and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the customer takes ownership  primarily upon product shipment  and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
customers have days to notify the company if the product is damaged or defective 
beyond that  there are no significant obligations that remain after shipment other than warranty obligations 
contracts with customers do not include product return rights  however  the company may elect in certain circumstances to accept returns of products 
the company records revenue for product sales net of returns 
sales and use tax are reported on a net basis  excluding them from sales and cost of sales 
in general  the company warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship and will fully conform to and perform to specifications for a period of one year 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that it has experienced in the past 
accounts receivable reserves this reserve is an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are uncollectible 
the reserve is based on a combination of specific customer knowledge  general economic conditions and historical trends 
management believes the results could be materially different if economic conditions change for our customers 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of our cost or market value 
market value is an estimate of the future net realizable value of our inventory 
it is based on historical trends  product life cycles  forecasts of future inventory needs and on hand inventory levels 
management believes reserve levels could be materially affected by changes in technology  our customer base  customer needs  general economic conditions and the success of certain company sales programs 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets considerable management judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows and other factors affecting the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  including the operating and macroeconomic factors that may affect them 
the company uses historical financial information  internal plans and projections and industry information in making such estimates 
the company did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill or intangible assets during fiscal  or  other than that related to discontinued operations described in note to the company s financial statements 
while the company currently believes the expected cash flows from these assets exceeds the carrying amount  materially different assumptions regarding future performance and discount rates could result in future impairment losses 
in particular  if the company no longer believes it will achieve its long term projected sales or operating expenses  the company may conclude in connection with any future impairment tests that the estimated fair value of its goodwill  including intangible assets  are less than the book value and recognize an impairment charge 
such impairment would adversely affect the company s earnings 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is periodically assessed to insure their carrying value does not exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from their expected use and eventual disposition 
this assessment includes certain assumptions related to future needs for the asset to help generate future cash flow 
changes in those assessments  future economic conditions or technological changes could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of these assets 
deferred taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
actual future operating results  as well as changes in our future performance  could have a material impact on the valuation allowance 
employee benefit obligations we provide retirement and health care insurance for certain domestic and retirees and former selas employees 
we measure the costs of our obligation based on our best estimate 
the net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the post retirement benefit 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
changes in actuarial assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality and withdrawal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency risk we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign currency exchange rates through operational and financial market actions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
we manufacture and sell our products in a number of locations around the world  resulting in a diversified revenue and cost base that is exposed to fluctuations in european and asian currencies 
this diverse base of foreign currency revenues and costs serves to create a hedge that limits our net exposure to fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are occasionally managed by financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of six months or less to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of the nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables relating to select contracts 
the decision by management to hedge any such transaction is made on a case by case basis 
foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in the same currency as the receivable or payable being covered  and the term and amount of the forward foreign exchange contract substantially mirrors the term and amount of the underlying receivable or payable 
the receivables and payables being covered arise from bank debt  trade and intercompany transactions of and among our foreign subsidiaries 
we cannot assure you that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents all assets and liabilities of foreign operations with foreign functional currency are translated into us dollars at prevailing rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange for the year 
the functional currency of the company s german operations is the european euro 
as of january   the functional currency of the company s singapore operations changed from the singapore dollar to the us dollar 
the functional currency of the company s indonesian operations is the us dollar 
adjustments resulting from the process of translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax  where appropriate 
foreign currency transaction amounts included in the statements of operation include losses of  and in  and  respectively 
for more information regarding foreign currency risks  see foreign currency fluctuation above 
interest rate risk from time to time  the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps in managing its interest rate exposure 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
when entered into  the company formally designates the derivative financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure if such criteria are met  and documents both the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge 
the company formally assesses  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposure 
because of the high correlation between the derivative financial instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative financial instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument s change in fair value would be immediately recognized in earnings 
interest rate swaps  which are considered derivative instruments  of are reported in the balance sheets at fair value in other current liabilities at december  for more information on the interest rate swaps outstanding see note in the notes to the company s financial statements
