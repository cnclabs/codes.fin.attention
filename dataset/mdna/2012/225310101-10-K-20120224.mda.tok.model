overview we provide auto loans to consumers regardless of their credit history 
our product is offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing  from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers  and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our product  but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing 
for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the same period in and million  or per diluted share  for the same period in the growth in consolidated net income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our loan portfolio 
the growth in consolidated net income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our loan portfolio and an improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio 
critical success factors critical success factors include our ability to access capital on acceptable terms  accurately forecast consumer loan performance  and maintain or grow consumer loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate  with an objective to maximize economic profit 
economic profit is a financial metric we use to evaluate our financial results and determine incentive compensation 
economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital  both debt and equity  and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business 
access to capital our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to maintain consistent financial performance  maintain modest financial leverage  and maintain multiple funding sources 
our funded debt to equity ratio is as of december  we currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing a revolving secured line of credit  warehouse facilities  term abs financings  and senior notes 
consumer loan performance at the time a consumer loan is submitted to us for assignment  we forecast future expected cash flows from the consumer loan 
based on the amount and timing of these forecasts and expected expense levels  an advance or one time purchase payment is made to the related dealer partner at a price designed to achieve an acceptable return on capital 
if consumer loan performance equals or exceeds our original expectation  it is likely our target return on capital will be achieved 

table of contents we use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each consumer loan at the time of assignment 
we continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each consumer loan subsequent to assignment 
our evaluation becomes more accurate as the consumer loans age  as we use actual performance data in our forecast 
by comparing our current expected collection rate for each consumer loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment  we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast 
the following table compares our forecast of consumer loan collection rates as of december   with the forecasts as of december   as of december   and at the time of assignment  segmented by year of assignment forecasted collection percentage as of variance in forecasted collection percentage from consumer loan assignment year december  december  december  initial forecast december  december  initial forecast consumer loans assigned in   and have yielded forecasted collection results materially better than our initial estimates  while consumer loans assigned in and have yielded forecasted collection results materially worse than our initial estimates 
for all other assignment years presented  actual results have been very close to our initial estimates 
for the year ended december   forecasted collection rates improved for consumer loans assigned during    and and declined for consumer loans assigned during the forecasted collection rates were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for all other assignment years presented 
forecasting collection rates precisely at loan inception is difficult 
with this in mind  we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  even if collection rates are less than we currently forecast 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of december  all amounts  unless otherwise noted  are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
the table includes both dealer loans and purchased loans 
as of december  consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread of forecast realized represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections 

table of contents the risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the consumer loans age 
for and prior consumer loan assignments  the risk of a material forecast variance is modest  as we have currently realized in excess of of the expected collections 
conversely  the forecasted collection rates for more recent consumer loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized 
the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate declined during the through period as we increased advance rates during this period in response to a more difficult competitive environment 
during and  the spread increased as the competitive environment improved  and we reduced advance rates 
in addition  during  the spread was positively impacted by better than expected consumer loan performance 
during and  the spread decreased as we increased advance rates during this period in an attempt to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate in response to an increase in the amount of capital available to fund new loans 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  and the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate as of december  for dealer loans and purchased loans separately 
all amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread dealer loans purchased loans represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
the advance rates presented for each consumer loan assignment year change over time due to the impact of transfers between dealer and purchased loans 
under our portfolio program  certain events may result in dealer partners forfeiting their rights to dealer holdback 
we transfer the dealer partner s consumer loans from the dealer loan portfolio to the purchased loan portfolio in the period this forfeiture occurs 
although the advance rate on purchased loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on dealer loans  purchased loans do not require us to pay dealer holdback 

table of contents consumer loan volume the following table summarizes changes in consumer loan assignment volume in each of the last quarters as compared to the same period in the previous year year over year percent change three months ended unit volume dollar volume march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
consumer loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including the overall demand for our product  the amount of capital available to fund new loans  and our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support 
our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate  within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints 
unit and dollar volumes were positively impacted by an increase in active dealer partners and advance rate increases made during the first and fourth quarters of and the second and third quarters of dollar volumes were also positively impacted by an increase in the size of the average consumer loan assignment 
while the advance rate increases reduced the return on capital we expect to earn on new assignments  we believe it is very likely the advance increases had a positive impact on economic profit 
unit volume for the one month ended january  increased by as compared to the same period in 
table of contents the following table summarizes the changes in consumer loan unit volume and active dealer partners for the years ended december  change to to consumer loan unit volume active dealer partners average volume per active dealer partner active dealer partners are dealer partners who have received funding for at least one loan during the period

the average yield on our loan portfolio for the year ended december  decreased as compared to the same period in due to lower yields on new loans  partially offset by improvements in forecasted collection rates throughout and premiums earned 
for the year ended december   premiums earned increased million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily due to growth in the size of our reinsurance portfolio which resulted from growth in new consumer loan assignments throughout and that was partially offset by the termination of our arrangement with one of our third party insurers during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents other income 
for the year ended december   other income increased million  or  as compared to the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in gap profit sharing income and dealer enrollment fees 
the increase in gap profit sharing income of million was the result of an increase in the annual profit sharing payment received and recognized during the first quarter of and an acceleration in our revenue recognition for this income beginning in the second quarter of under our arrangement with our third party gap provider  we receive annual profit sharing payments based on the performance of our gap program 
prior to the second quarter of  we received and recognized gap profit sharing payments annually in the first quarter of each year 
during the second quarter of  we began recognizing this income over the life of the gap contracts 
these increases were partially offset by million of income recognized during related to discontinued arrangements with a third party vehicle service contract provider and a vendor that processes payments 
we have not recognized any income related to these arrangements since the second quarter of operating expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in the change in operating expenses is due to the following an increase in sales and marketing expense of million  or  primarily due to increased sales commissions resulting from our growth in consumer loan assignment volume and the expansion of our sales force 
an increase in salaries and wages expense of million  or  resulting from higher servicing expenses associated with increased staffing levels needed to manage the greater volume of consumer loans in our portfolio  partially offset by reduced support expenses associated with information technology activities 
a decrease in general and administrative expense of million  or  primarily due to decreased support expenses  including consulting fees related to the development of software  a refund received in the current year from the successful appeal of a property tax assessment  and legal costs 
provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses increased million  or  as compared to under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  when the present value of forecasted future cash flows decline relative to our expectations at the time of assignment  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
for purposes of calculating the required allowance  dealer loans are grouped by dealer partner and purchased loans are grouped by month of purchase 
as a result  regardless of the overall performance of the portfolio of consumer loans  a provision can be required if any individual loan pool performs worse than expected 
conversely  a previously recorded provision can be reversed if any previously impaired individual loan pool experiences an improvement in performance 
during the year ended december   overall consumer loan performance exceeded our expectations at the start of the year 
however  the performance of certain loan pools declined from our expectations during the year  resulting in a provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december   of which million related to dealer loans partially offset by a reversal of provision of million related to purchased loans 
during the year ended december   overall consumer loan performance exceeded our expectations at the start of the year 
however  the performance of certain loan pools declined from our expectations during the year  resulting in a provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december   of which million related to dealer loans and million related to purchased loans

the average outstanding debt balance increased compared to the same period in due to the use of the debt proceeds to fund the growth in new consumer loan assignments and stock repurchases 
the decline in our pre tax average cost of debt resulted from a reduction in fixed fees as a percentage of average outstanding debt and a change in the mix of our outstanding debt 
provision for claims 
for the year ended december   provision for claims increased million  or  as compared to the increase was due to an increase in the size of our reinsurance portfolio and an increase in claims paid per reinsured vehicle service contract 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate increased to  from compared to the increase is primarily due to the impact of the lower effective tax rate in the prior year resulting from the reversal of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions that were resolved and settled with the internal revenue service irs and adjustments to our state tax liability

for the year ended december   other income increased million  or  as compared to the increase in other income was primarily a result of million of income recognized during the second quarter of related to an arrangement with one of our third party vehicle service contract providers 
this arrangement was discontinued in and no additional income is expected beyond the amount recognized to date 
while we continue to generate income from vehicle service contracts  such amounts are captured through vsc re and recorded over the life of the contracts as premiums earned less provision for claims 
operating expenses 
for the year ended december   operating expenses decreased million  or  as compared to the same period in the change in operating expenses is due to the following a decrease in salaries and wages expense of million  or  resulting from decreased support expenses associated with information technology activities  and reduced servicing expenses related to efficiencies realized through the implementation of strategic initiatives and fewer delinquent accounts 
a decrease in general and administrative expense of million  or  primarily due to decreased support expenses  including legal costs  consulting fees related to the irs examination  sales tax expense  and depreciation expense related to a reduction in capital expenditures

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment  and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 

table of contents finance charge revenue allowance for credit losses balance sheet captions loans receivable allowance for credit losses income statement captions finance charges provision for credit losses nature of estimates required estimating the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments 
assumptions and approaches used for accounting purposes  we are not considered to be an originator of consumer loans  but instead are considered to be a lender to our dealer partners for consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program  and a purchaser of consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
as a result of this classification  our accounting policies for recognizing finance charge revenue and determining our allowance for credit losses may be different from other lenders in our market  who  based on their different business models  may be considered to be a direct lender to consumers for accounting purposes 
for additional information regarding our classification as a lender to our dealer partners for accounting purposes  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents we recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
for dealer loans  finance charge revenue and the allowance for credit losses are calculated after first aggregating dealer loans outstanding for each dealer partner 
for the same purpose  purchased loans are aggregated according to the month the loan was purchased 
an allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net asset value loan balance less the allowance to the value of forecasted future cash flows discounted at the yield established at the time of assignment 
the discounted value of future cash flows is comprised of estimated future collections on the loans  less any estimated dealer holdback payments related to dealer loans 
we write off loans once there are no forecasted future collections on any of the associated consumer loans 
actual cash flows from any individual dealer loan or pool of purchased loans are often different than estimated cash flows at the time of assignment 
if such difference is favorable  the difference is recognized prospectively into income over the remaining life of the dealer loan or pool of purchased loans through a yield adjustment 
if such difference is unfavorable  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
because differences between estimated cash flows at the time of assignment and actual cash flows occur often  an allowance is required for a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
an allowance for credit losses does not necessarily indicate that a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans is unprofitable  and in recent years  very seldom are cash flows from a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans insufficient to repay the initial amounts advanced or paid to the dealer partner 
future collections on dealer and purchased loans are forecasted based on the historical performance of consumer loans with similar characteristics  adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns 
dealer holdback is forecasted based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each dealer loan 
key factors variances in the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods 
a decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on loans as of december  would have reduced net income by approximately million 

table of contents premiums earned balance sheet caption accounts payable and accrued liabilities income statement caption premiums earned nature of estimates required estimating the pattern of future claims on vehicle service contracts 
assumptions and approaches used premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience 
in developing our cost expectations  we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term  as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past 
we will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate  including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence  and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified 
premiums earned for the year ended december  include million of revenue related to a revision in our revenue recognition timing 
we revised our revenue recognition timing during the third quarter of in order to better match the timing with our expected costs of servicing those contracts 
key factors variances in the pattern of future claims from our current estimates would impact the timing of premiums recognized in future periods 
a change in premiums earned for the year ended december  would have affected net income by approximately million 

table of contents stock based compensation expense balance sheet caption paid in capital income statement caption salaries and wages nature of estimates required stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date the equity instrument is granted or awarded by us  and is recognized over the expected vesting period of the equity instrument 
we also estimate expected forfeiture rates of restricted stock awards 
assumptions and approaches used in recognizing restricted stock based compensation expense  we make assumptions regarding the expected forfeiture rates of the restricted stock awards 
we also make assumptions regarding the expected vesting dates of performance based restricted stock awards 
the fair value of restricted stock awards are estimated as if they were vested and issued on the grant date and are recognized over the expected vesting period of the restricted stock award 
for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which are incorporated herein by reference 
key factors changes in the expected vesting dates of performance based restricted stock awards and expected forfeiture rates would impact the amount and timing of stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods

assumptions and approaches used with assistance from our legal counsel  we determine if the likelihood of an adverse judgment for various claims and litigation is remote  reasonably possible  or probable 
to the extent we believe an adverse judgment is probable and the amount of the judgment is estimable  we recognize a liability 
for information regarding the potential various claims against us  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
key factors negative variances in the ultimate disposition of claims and litigation outstanding from current estimates could result in additional expense in future periods 

table of contents uncertain tax positions balance sheet captions income taxes receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities income statement caption provision for income taxes nature of estimates required estimating the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return 
assumptions and approaches used we follow a two step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions 
first  we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  for positions that we determine are more likely than not to be sustained  we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being sustained 
we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or more information becomes available 
on june   we reached a settlement with the irs which concluded the examination of our federal income tax returns for through and closed the respective years 
as a result of the settlement  we agreed to pay a total of million in federal and state taxes and interest related to these years 
the settlement includes million of taxes that represent an acceleration of taxes already provided for in prior periods and the payment did not have an impact on our net income during the reporting periods 
we also concluded that all through uncertain federal jurisdiction tax positions taken in previous periods are effectively settled and we recorded a reversal of corresponding accrued reserves and interest 
this reversal had a favorable impact of million after tax on our net income for the year ended december  for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
key factors to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in future periods could be materially affected 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we need capital to maintain and grow our business 
our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  collections of consumer loans and borrowings under a revolving secured line of credit  warehouse facilities  term abs financings  and senior notes 
there are various restrictive debt covenants for each financing arrangement and we are in compliance with those covenants as of december  for information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes  which  together with the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes we issued on february   are governed by an indenture  dated as of february   as amended and supplemented the indenture  among us  as the issuer  our subsidiaries buyers vehicle protection plan  inc and vehicle remarketing services  inc  as guarantors the guarantors  and us bank national association  as trustee 
the senior notes issued during the first quarter of have the same terms as the previously issued senior notes  other than issue price and issue date  and all of the senior notes are treated as a single class under the indenture 
the senior notes mature on february  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  computed on the basis of a day year comprised of twelve day months and payable semi annually on february and august of each year 
the senior notes issued during the first quarter of were issued at a price of of their aggregate principal amount  resulting in gross proceeds of million  and a yield to maturity of per annum 
during the second quarter of  we extended the maturity of our revolving secured line of credit facility from june  to june  additionally  the amount of the facility was increased from million to million 
the financial covenant that required us to maintain a minimum ratio of assets to debt and the floor on the libor rate were eliminated 
during the second quarter of  we extended the date on which warehouse facility ii will cease to revolve from june  to june  the interest rate on borrowings under the facility was decreased from the commercial paper rate plus to the commercial paper rate plus 
during the second quarter of  we decreased the interest rate on warehouse facility iii from libor plus to libor plus 
during the third quarter of  we entered into warehouse facility iv with a facility limit of million 
the facility will cease to revolve on february  borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a million term abs financing which was used to repay outstanding indebtedness 
the financing has an expected annualized cost of approximately including the initial purchaser s fees and other costs and it will revolve for months after which it will amortize based upon the cash flows on the contributed loans 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  from million as of december  our total balance sheet indebtedness increased to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily due to the growth in new consumer loan assignments and the completion of a tender offer to purchase million of our common stock using the proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes and borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility

the amounts are presented on a gross basis to exclude the net unamortized debt premium of million 
we are also obligated to make interest payments at the applicable interest rates  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
based on the actual amounts outstanding under our revolving secured line of credit  our warehouse facilities  and our senior notes as of december   the forecasted amounts outstanding on all other debt and the actual interest rates in effect as of december   interest is expected to be approximately million during  million during  and million during and thereafter 
purchase obligations consist primarily of contractual obligations related to our information system and facility needs 
other future obligations included in the above table consist solely of reserves for uncertain tax positions 
payments are contingent upon examination and would occur in the periods in which the uncertain tax positions are settled 
we have contractual obligations to pay dealer holdback to our dealer partners  however  as payments of dealer holdback are contingent upon the receipt of consumer payments and the repayment of advances  these obligations are excluded from the table above
