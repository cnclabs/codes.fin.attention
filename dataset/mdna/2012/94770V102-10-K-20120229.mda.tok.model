introduction our company 
webmd health corp 
is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering on september  our common stock trades under the symbol wbmd on the nasdaq global select market 
from the completion of our initial public offering through the completion of our merger which we refer to as the merger with hlth corporation which we refer to as hlth on october   we were more than owned by hlth 
on october   stockholders of hlth and webmd approved the merger and the transaction was completed later that day  with hlth merging into webmd and webmd continuing as the surviving corporation 
webmd automatically succeeded to all of hlth s assets  liabilities and commitments upon completion of the merger other than the shares of webmd class b common stock owned by hlth which were cancelled in the merger 
in the merger  each share of hlth common stock was converted into shares of webmd common stock 
the shares of webmd s class a common stock were unchanged in the merger and continue to trade on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol wbmd  however  they are no longer referred to as class a because the merger eliminated both webmd s class b common stock and the dual class stock structure that had existed at webmd 
the key reasons for the merger included allowing hlth s stockholders to participate directly in the 
table of contents ownership of webmd  while eliminating hlth s controlling interest in webmd and the inefficiencies associated with having two separate public companies  increasing the ability of webmd to raise capital and to obtain financing  and improving the liquidity of webmd common stock by significantly increasing the number of shares held by public stockholders 
webmd was the only operating business of hlth at the time the merger closed 
accordingly  the completion of the merger did not have a significant effect on the operations of webmd since there were no hlth business operations to combine with webmd s business operations and  while hlth had previously been providing certain corporate services to webmd under a services agreement and had certain other agreements with webmd  those agreements ceased when webmd acquired hlth 
the employees and resources of hlth used to provide services to webmd under the services agreement became employees and resources of webmd upon completion of the merger 
basis of presentation  accounting treatment of the merger 
the applicable accounting treatment for the merger resulted in hlth being considered the acquiring entity of the webmd non controlling interest 
accordingly  the pre acquisition consolidated financial statements of hlth became the historical financial statements of webmd following the completion of the merger  adjusted as described in the next paragraph 
accordingly  in this md a  webmd or the use of we  our  or similar words refers not only to webmd itself but also  where the context requires  to hlth 
the specific names of hlth and webmd are used only where there is a need to distinguish between the legal entities 
in addition  all references in this md a to amounts of shares of hlth common stock and to market prices or purchase prices for hlth common stock have been adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio in the merger which we refer to as the exchange ratio and are expressed as the number of shares of webmd common stock into which the hlth common stock would be converted in the merger and the equivalent price per share of webmd common stock 
similarly  the exercise price of options and warrants to purchase hlth common stock and the number of shares subject to those options and warrants have been adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio 
for all periods prior to the year ended december  in the selected financial data included in item of this annual report a the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing income per common share have been adjusted by multiplying the historical weighted average shares outstanding for hlth by the exchange ratio  and b basic and diluted income per common share have been recalculated to reflect the adjusted weighted average shares outstanding for the periods presented 
for the year ended december   these adjustments only apply to the portion of that year prior to the completion of the merger on october  the consolidated accounts of hlth included  until the completion of the merger  of the assets and liabilities of webmd  which was more than owned by hlth until the merger 
in the consolidated statements of operations included in this annual report including those in item  net income attributable to company stockholders reflects an adjustment for the noncontrolling stockholders share of the net income of webmd until completion of the merger

background information on certain trends influencing the use of our services 
several key trends in the healthcare  consumer products and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends are described briefly below use of the internet by consumers and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare related issues  motivated in part by the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers 
the internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information  enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of the advertisers and sponsors of our public portals  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will  over time  result in increasing demand for our services 
in addition  in an effort to improve operating efficiencies  some pharmaceutical companies have been reducing their field sales forces in the past several years 
we believe that  in their effort to achieve greater overall marketing efficiency  pharmaceutical companies will  over time  increase the use of online promotional marketing to physicians and other healthcare professionals  including through the use of our services 
however  notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand  we cannot predict how long it will take for pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies to shift a more significant portion of their marketing expenditures to online services 
in addition  our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including general economic and regulatory conditions and the following the majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months 
we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts 

table of contents the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program  as well as the additional time period before our services are delivered  may be longer than expected  especially for larger contracts  and may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals  including internal approvals relating to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the marketing of healthcare products 
during  we experienced a lengthening of this internal review process by pharmaceutical companies  which resulted in delays in contracting as well as delays in recognizing expected revenue under executed contracts and which may continue to cause such delays 
other factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors  or receipt of revenue under such contracts  include the timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products  the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products and any increase in the number or significance of such approvals or of withdrawals of products from the market  the timing of roll outs of new or enhanced services on our public portals  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 
reaching health conscious consumers 
more than half of the traffic to our consumer portals is in areas of health and wellness that are not related solely to diseases and conditions 
we expect that the demand for reaching health conscious consumers will continue to grow 
in addition to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies  our public portals advertisers and sponsors include consumer products companies whose products relate to health  wellness  diet  fitness  lifestyle  safety and illness prevention 
we plan to continue to focus on increasing sponsorship revenues from consumer products companies  retailers and other companies that are interested in communicating health related or safety related information about their products or services to our audience 
however  our services for these clients are subject to competition from traditional media  internet search engines  social media internet sites  general purpose consumer sites  and numerous other alternatives 
in addition  revenues from consumer products companies are more likely to reflect general economic conditions  and to be reduced to a greater extent during economic downturns or recessions  than revenues from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies 
accordingly  revenues from this portion of our business may fail to increase or may increase more slowly than we expect and may be subject to significant quarter to quarter variations 
recent developments in the business outlook for our public portals 
notwithstanding our general expectation for increased future demand for our public portal services  we experienced reduced revenue in our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to the prior year period  as a result of what we believe was a more cautious business outlook by many of our larger customers 
certain of our pharmaceutical company customers experienced patent expirations for highly profitable drugs in and others expect to do so in and such patent expirations allow for competition from lower priced generic versions of these drugs and generally result in the termination of marketing efforts for the drug 
additionally  we believe that these patent expirations have also led to  and may continue to lead to  significant overall reductions in marketing expenditures by some of these pharmaceutical companies across their entire product portfolios  as well as delays in their budgeting and purchase decisions 
as a result  we experienced reduced revenues in late  and expect to continue to experience such reductions for much of  particularly in the area of direct to consumer pharmaceutical marketing and advertising 
while we expect to see an increase in the number of new  pharmaceutical products coming to market in  marketing for these products is not anticipated to begin until the second half of and  as a result  sales of advertising and sponsorship services that we may make relating to these new products  if any  are not likely to contribute significantly to revenue until 
table of contents use of health management applications 
in a healthcare market where a greater share of the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been shifting to consumers  use of information technology to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that  through our private portals  we are well positioned to play a role in this environment 
however  our strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members and being able to demonstrate a sufficient return on investment and other benefits for our private portals clients from those services 
increasing usage of our private portal services requires us to continue to develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of healthcare decision support tools and online health management applications and health information services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
we also expect that  for clients and potential clients that have been adversely affected by general economic conditions or are seeking to reduce expenses for other reasons  we may continue to experience some reductions in initial contracts  contract expansions and contract renewals for our private portal services  as well as reductions in the size of existing contracts 
initiatives to improve and expand our services 
in the past several years  video and multi media applications have become an increasingly important part of what users expect from internet sites 
in addition  consumers are increasingly using the internet to access social media as a means to communicate and exchange information  including regarding health and wellness 
similarly  physicians and other healthcare professionals are increasingly participating in condition or topic specific community groups and other interactive applications 
consumers and healthcare professionals are also increasingly using mobile devices to access the internet  with physicians increasingly using mobile devices in diagnosis and treatment at the point of care 
mobile  while not yet a meaningful source of revenue for us  is expected to be an important area of growth for the future 
we are focused on delivering a multi screen platform that extends the user experience beyond the desktop portal onto the mobile device 
we have invested and intend to continue to invest in software and systems that allow us to meet the demands of our users and sponsors  including customized content management and publishing technology to deliver interactive content  multimedia programming and personalized health applications that engage our users 
the following are some initiatives we have pursued or plan to pursue to improve the user experience on our websites  expand our services and increase our user base physician connect  our social networking platform for physicians  enables them to exchange information online on a range of topics  including patient care  drug information  healthcare related legislation and practice management 
physicians can also create polls to assess the opinions of their colleagues on a range of topics 
we also offer third parties the opportunity to sponsor physician connect discussions and polls so that they can gain insights into physicians perspectives and areas of interest 
as of december   physician connect had attracted approximately  physician members 
medscape also offers a variety of sponsored and unsponsored blogs where healthcare professionals can share their thoughts and opinions with the medscape community 
webmd community  our social networking initiative for consumers  gives them the ability to connect online with health experts and with other webmd members to exchange information  experiences and support regarding specific health conditions or concerns and to participate in discussions on other health and wellness topics 
registered webmd members can become members of the specific webmd communities they select 
webmd communities may include chat rooms  moderated message boards  expert blogs and other forums 
medscape mobile is a free medical application that includes medscape s specialty specific news  comprehensive drug information and clinical reference tools 
medscape mobile also includes cme activities organized by specialty and designed for use on a mobile device 
medscape mobile was launched for iphone and ipod touch users in  for blackberry users in april and for ipad tm and android tm users in january as of december   medscape mobile had attracted approximately million registered users 

table of contents webmd for iphone and webmd for ipad are free applications for consumers that provide mobile access to certain webmd content and tools on an iphone or ipad tm  including symptom checker  first aid  and pill identifier applications  as well as other health information 
in may  webmd launched webmd for android  with similar content and tools 
as of february   these mobile applications had been downloaded a total of approximately million times 
in addition  our websites can be accessed through any mobile electronic device that includes an internet browser 
webmd baby 
in january  we launched the webmd baby application for iphone and ipod touch  a free mobile application for parents of infants and toddlers 
webmd baby gives new parents access to pediatrician approved baby health and wellness information 
webmd baby content was created exclusively for the application and is personalized for a baby s specific age 
webmd baby helps keep parents informed with easily accessible baby health and wellness information that they can trust 
a personal growth chart for baby toddler is also integrated into the application  allowing information to be easily added right from the pediatrician s office 
during the first four weeks after its launch  webmd baby was downloaded more than  times 
international 
we are pursuing opportunities to expand the reach of our brands outside the united states 
in certain markets outside the united states  we expect that we would accomplish this through partnerships or joint ventures with other companies having expertise in the specific country or region 
in october  we launched our first major consumer portal outside the united states in partnership with boots  the united kingdom s leading pharmacy led health and beauty retailer 
in addition  in certain markets outside of the united states  we expect to provide some of our online services directly to healthcare professionals and  to a lesser extent  consumers 
healthcare reform legislation 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of which we refer to as the reform legislation  was signed into law in march the reform legislation makes extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the united states 
in general  the reform legislation seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal united states residents by  among other things  requiring individuals to carry  and certain employers to offer  health insurance or be subject to penalties 
the reform legislation also imposes new regulations on health insurers  including guaranteed coverage requirements  prohibitions on certain annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to plan members  increased restrictions on rescinding coverage  establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements  a requirement to cover certain preventive services on a first dollar basis  the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages  and greater limitations on how health insurers price certain of their products 
the reform legislation also contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies  including new taxes on certain sales of their products 
many of the provisions of the reform legislation that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until  and many provisions require regulations and interpretive guidance to be issued before they will be fully implemented 
some provisions do not apply to health plans that were in place when the reform legislation was enacted and have not been substantially changed since 
in addition  it is difficult to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the reform legislation 
furthermore  the reform legislation will result in future state legislative and regulatory changes  which we are unable to predict at this time  in order for states to comply with certain provisions of the reform legislation and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities 
in addition  a number of parties have filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of the reform legislation 
the supreme court is considering the constitutionality of the individual mandate aspect of the reform legislation and certain other matters regarding the reform legislation and is expected to render its decision by june while we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on webmd as a direct result of the application of the reform legislation to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer  we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts of the reform legislation will be on webmd s business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants  including pharmaceutical and 
table of contents medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of our public portals and employers and health plans that are clients of our private portals 
healthcare industry participants may respond to the reform legislation or to uncertainties created by the reform legislation by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions  including expenditures for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
however  we believe that certain aspects of the reform legislation and future implementing regulations that seek to reduce healthcare costs may create opportunities for webmd  including with respect to our personal health record applications and health and benefits decision support tools and  more generally  with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education 
for example  the reform legislation encourages use of wellness programs through grants to small employers to establish such programs  permission for employers to offer rewards  in the form of waivers of cost sharing  premium discounts  or additional benefits  to employees for participating in these programs and meeting certain standards  and the inclusion of wellness services and chronic disease management among the essential health benefits that certain plans are required to provide 
however  we cannot yet determine the scope of any such opportunities or what competition we may face in our efforts to pursue such opportunities 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online and mobile services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our business from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
background information on certain transactions and other significant developments convertible notes

the total cost of the september tender offer was  which includes of costs directly attributable to the purchase

in this md a  we refer to this tender offer as the tender offer 
the total cost of the tender offer was  which includes of costs directly attributable to the purchase 
each of the tender offers described in this paragraph represented an opportunity for webmd to return capital to stockholders who elected to tender their shares of webmd common stock  while stockholders who chose not to participate in a tender offer automatically increased their relative percentage interest in our company at no additional cost to them 
on february   we announced our intention to commence a modified dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to million of our common stock at a price within the range of to per share the dutch auction tender offer 
based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  we will determine the lowest per share price within the range that will enable us to buy million in shares  or such lesser number of shares that are properly tendered 
all shares accepted for payment will be paid the same price  regardless of whether a shareholder tendered such shares at a lower price within the range 
the dutch auction tender offer is expected to commence in march  subject to a number of terms and conditions 
sale of porex  senior secured notes 
sntc holding  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of our company  entered into a stock purchase agreement  dated as of september   for the sale of our porex business which we refer to as porex for which we received  in cash at closing  received  in senior secured notes which we refer to as the senior secured notes and incurred approximately  of transaction expenses

through the ars option  we received cash proceeds of  during the period from april  through december  and  during the year ended december  
table of contents divestiture of the little blue book print directory business 
in march  we decided to divest the little blue book print directory business which we refer to as lbb 
as a result  the historical financial information for lbb has been reflected as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
during the three months ended june   we recorded an impairment charge of  to reduce the carrying value of lbb to its current estimated fair value 
on september   we completed the sale of lbb in which we received cash proceeds of  indemnification obligations to former officers and directors of emdeon practice services 
on september   hlth completed the sale of emdeon practice services  inc which we refer to as eps to sage software  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the sage group plc which we refer to as the eps sale 
hlth had certain indemnity obligations to advance amounts for reasonable defense costs for initially ten  and later four  former officers and directors of eps which we refer to as the eps indemnification obligations who were indicted in connection with an investigation by the united states attorney for the district of south carolina which we refer to as the investigation that began in the investigation related principally to issues of financial accounting improprieties relating to medical manager corporation  a predecessor of hlth by its merger into hlth in september  and  more specifically  hlth s former medical manager health systems  inc subsidiary 
medical manager health systems was a predecessor to eps 
on december   the united states attorney announced the indictments of ten former officers and employees of medical manager health systems 
the indictment initially charged the defendants with conspiracy to commit mail  wire and securities fraud  a violation of title  united states code  section and conspiracy to commit money laundering  a violation of title  united states code  section h but the second count was dismissed in one of the defendants passed away in and was dismissed from the indictment 
four of the defendants were dismissed from the case and two defendants were severed from the case and their cases were transferred to tampa  florida 
in addition  one of the defendants entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the united states pursuant to which all charges were dismissed against him on july  the trial of two of the former officers of medical manager health systems began on january  and  on march   both men were found guilty by the jury  however  the court set the verdict aside on may  and entered a judgment of acquittal 
in connection with the eps sale  hlth agreed to retain the responsibility for the eps indemnification obligations and webmd assumed that responsibility upon completion of the merger in october during the year ended december   based on information available at that time  hlth determined a reasonable estimate of the range of probable costs with respect to its indemnification obligations and  accordingly  recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of  which represented its estimate of the low end of the probable range of costs related to this matter 
hlth had reserved the low end of the probable range of costs because no estimate within the range was a better estimate than any other amount 
that estimate included assumptions as to the duration of the trial and pre trial periods  and the defense costs to be incurred during these periods 
we updated the estimated range of the indemnification obligations based on new information received during the years ended december  and  and as a result  recorded additional pre tax charges of  and  respectively 
as described above  two of the former officers and directors of eps were found guilty  however  the court set the verdict aside on may  and entered a judgment of acquittal 
the government entered a notice of appeal with respect to the court s order 
at that time  two other former officers of eps were awaiting trial in tampa  florida  which was scheduled to begin on october   however  on july   the court in tampa placed the case against those defendants on hold pending resolution of the appeal of the south carolina ruling 
on june   upon the motion of the government  the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit dismissed the government s appeal of the district court s rulings  thereby ending the government s case against the two defendants in south carolina 
on july   upon the motion of the government  the united states district court for the middle district of florida granted a motion to dismiss the government s case against the remaining two defendants in florida 
as a result of these two decisions  it is our understanding that the investigation has concluded 
as of december   the remaining accrual with respect to the eps indemnification obligations was  and was included within liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we reversed the remainder of this accrual as we determined that we no longer had any remaining liability with respect to the eps 
table of contents indemnification obligations as a result of the june  and july  decisions described above 
the reversal of the remaining accrual of  is included in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  within our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  also included within liabilities of discontinued operations related to this matter was  as of december   which represented certain reimbursements received from our insurance carriers between july  and december  under certain directors and officers liability insurance policies which we refer to as the policies for expenses that we had incurred and expected to continue to incur for the eps indemnification obligations 
we deferred recognizing these insurance reimbursements within the consolidated statement of operations because of the possibility they might have to be repaid to the insurance carriers under the terms of the applicable policies 
however  as a result of the june  and july  dismissals described above  we believe that the insurance carriers do not have the ability to recover this amount and accordingly  we reversed this accrual during the year ended december  the reversal of  is included in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  within our consolidated statements of operations during the year ended december  during the year ended december   income from discontinued operations primarily related to the release back to us of  for certain eps related compensation that was previously held in escrow  offset by a charge related to the settlement with one of our directors and officers liability insurance carriers 
during the year ended december   we received reimbursements for eps indemnification obligations from our insurance carriers under the policies in the amount of  and recognized that amount within consolidated income from discontinued operations during the year ended december  seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
our public portal advertising and sponsorship revenue is seasonal  primarily due to the annual spending patterns of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and generally increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  many of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and website development costs  the

critical accounting policies we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  information services and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as related health coaching services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period that we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables that were entered into prior to january   revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on its relative fair value determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
in certain instances where fair value did not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements to the extent vsoe exists for the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value did not exist for the undelivered elements  the entire consideration is recognized over the period that the last element is delivered 
contracts that contain multiple deliverables that were entered into subsequent to january  are subject to accounting standards update no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu requires the allocation of revenue to each deliverable of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
it also changes the level of evidence of selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a company to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when more objective evidence of selling price is not available 
we adopted asu on a prospective basis for arrangements entered into or materially modified on or subsequent to january  beginning january   pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue to each deliverable based on relative selling price 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our revenue recognition policies over the period that delivery occurs 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical pricing trends for specific products and services 
tpe is based on competitor prices of similar deliverables when sold separately 
we are generally not able to determine tpe of selling price as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors selling prices are for comparable services  combined with the fact that our services often contain unique features and customizations such that comparable services do not exist 
the determination of best estimate of selling price is a judgmental process that considers multiple factors including  but not limited to  recent selling prices and related discounting practices for each service  market conditions  customer classes  sales channels and other factors 
as a result of the adoption of asu  revenue for the year ended december  was higher by than the revenue that would have been recognized under the previous accounting standard 
this resulted from services that were provided or partially provided during the year ended december   for certain deliverables of our multiple deliverable arrangements for which we would have previously deferred the related revenue under the previous accounting standards 
during the year ended december   we assigned value to these deliverables using our best estimate of selling price  and 
table of contents recognized revenue as they were delivered 
the multiple deliverable arrangements that were impacted by asu related to our public portal revenues and the services underlying such arrangements are generally delivered over periods of twelve months or less 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting asu on future periods as the impact will vary based on many factors including  but not limited to  the quantity and size of new or materially modified multiple deliverable arrangements entered into  as well as the nature of the various services contained within those arrangements and the time periods over which those services are delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on fair value using exit price and market participant view  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell 
there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets noted as a result of our impairment testing in fair value of investments in auction rate securities ars 
through april   we held investments in ars which were backed by student loans  guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of these ars holdings approximated par value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  substantially all auctions involving these securities have failed 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars holdings will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets develop 
additionally  approximately one half of the auction rate securities we held were  during  either downgraded below aaa or placed on watch status by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
during the periods that we held them  we estimated the fair value of our ars holdings using an income approach valuation technique 
using this approach  expected future cash flows are calculated over the expected life of each security and are discounted to a single present value using a market required rate of return 
some of the more significant assumptions made in the present value calculations included i the estimated weighted average lives for the loan portfolios underlying each individual ars and ii the required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows over the estimated life of each security  which considered both the credit quality for each individual ars and the market liquidity for these investments 
additionally  effective april   we adopted new authoritative guidance which required us to separate losses associated with our ars into two categories  the portion of the loss which is considered credit loss and the portion of the loss which is due to other factors 
as discussed above  certain of the auction rate securities we held were  during  downgraded below aaa by one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
these revised credit ratings were a significant consideration in determining the estimated credit loss associated with our ars 
our ars were classified as level assets as their valuation  including the portion of their valuation attributable to credit losses  required substantial judgment and estimation of factors that were not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars holdings  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of those investments 
table of contents could have been significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
in connection with the sale of our ars on april   we retained an option which we refer to as the ars option  for a period of two years a to repurchase from the purchaser the same principal amount of any or all of the various series of ars sold  at the agreed upon purchase prices received on april   and b to receive additional proceeds from the purchaser upon certain redemptions of the various series of ars sold 
during and  we recognized aggregate gains of  and  respectively  related to the ars option  and received cash proceeds of  and  during and  respectively 
the value of the ars option as of december  is estimated to be  and has been classified as a level asset as its valuation requires substantial judgment 
the historical redemption activity of the specific ars underlying the ars option was the most significant assumption used to determine an estimated value of the ars option 
we are required to reassess the value of this ars option at each reporting period  and any changes in value will be recorded within the statement of operations in future periods 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information regarding our ars option 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
the grant date fair value for stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of the share based payment awards 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards held by employees  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years  related to our stock based compensation plans 
deferred taxes 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits 
these net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets  including the portion related to excess tax benefits of stock based awards  are reserved for by a valuation allowance as required by relevant accounting literature 
the remaining portion of our net deferred tax assets are no longer reserved for by a valuation allowance 
management determines the need for a valuation allowance by assessing the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance in the future 
tax contingencies 
our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from applications of various statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable 
however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
consistent with our historical financial reporting  we have elected to reflect interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision benefit

table of contents explanatory note regarding adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed as supplemental to  and not as an alternative for  consolidated income from continuing operations or net income attributable to company stockholders calculated in accordance with gaap 
our management uses adjusted ebitda as an additional measure of performance for purposes of business decision making  including developing budgets  managing expenditures  and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures 
period to period comparisons of adjusted ebitda help our management identify additional trends in financial results that may not be shown solely by period to period comparisons of consolidated income from continuing operations or net income attributable to company stockholders 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our performance 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by our management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions 
in addition  we believe that providing adjusted ebitda  together with a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to consolidated income from continuing operations or to net income attributable to company stockholders  helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies that may have different capital structures  different effective income tax rates and tax attributes  different capitalized asset values and or different forms of employee compensation

table of contents deployed across our public and private portal websites in order to enable us to service future growth in unique users and page views  as well as to create new sponsorship areas for our customers  and to improve the systems used to provide our private portal applications 
based on our plans and expectations we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the cash commitments of our convertible notes and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  for at least the next twenty four months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  implementation of new or updated application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments and potential future acquisitions 
in addition  our ability to generate cash flow is subject to numerous factors beyond our control  including general economic  regulatory and other matters affecting us and our customers 
we plan to continue to enhance our online services and to continue to invest in acquisitions  strategic relationships  facilities and technological infrastructure and product development 
we intend to grow each of our existing businesses and enter into complementary ones through both internal investments and acquisitions 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities

recent accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an update to the existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the update simplifies how a company tests goodwill for impairment by allowing both public and nonpublic entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under that option  an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  entities have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
for public entities  the amendment is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment will result in a change only to our current presentation of comprehensive income 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to the existing guidance on fair value measurement 
the amendments are intended to create consistency between us generally accepted accounting standards and international financial reporting standards on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value 
table of contents measurements 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including i the application of the highest and best use valuation premise concepts  ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and iii quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level in addition  the amendments require additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  these changes are required to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this amendment may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our cash and money market investments  which approximate billion at december   are not subject to changes in interest rates 
the notes and notes issued in january and march  respectively  have a fixed interest rate  changes in interest rates will not impact our results of operations or financial position 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex  which was sold on october  and included in discontinued operations  was exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro

porex did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
foreign currency translation gains losses relating to our porex operations were million in
