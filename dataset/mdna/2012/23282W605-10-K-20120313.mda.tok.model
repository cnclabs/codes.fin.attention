item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions 
our research and development activities relating to the biology of muscle function have evolved from our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton  a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell 
our current research and development programs relating to the biology of muscle function are directed to small molecule modulators of the contractility of cardiac  skeletal and 
table of contents smooth muscle 
we have  and intend to continue  to leverage our experience in muscle contractility in order to expand our current pipeline into new therapeutic areas  and expect to continue to be able to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development 
our cardiac muscle contractility program is focused on the cardiac sarcomere  the basic unit of muscle contraction in the heart 
our lead drug candidate from this program  omecamtiv mecarbil formerly known as ck  is a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator 
amgen holds an exclusive license to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil worldwide  except japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
an intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil is currently the subject of a phase iib clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who are hospitalized with acute heart failure  known as atomic ahf acute treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to increase contractility in acute heart failure 
oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil are being studied in healthy volunteers  and we anticipate that one or more of these oral formulations will also be studied in stable heart failure patients 
we also are conducting joint research with amgen directed to next generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program 
ck is the lead drug candidate from our skeletal sarcomere activator program 
the skeletal muscle sarcomere is the basic unit of skeletal muscle contraction 
we believe ck may be useful in treating diseases or medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting 
we are currently conducting a phase ii clinical trials program for ck  including two ongoing phase ii clinical trials in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also known as als or lou gehrig s disease and an ongoing phase iia clinical trial in patients with myasthenia gravis 
we have also conducted a phase iia clinical trial of ck in patients with claudication  which is pain or cramping in the leg muscles due to inadequate blood flow during exercise  associated with peripheral artery disease 
ck has received orphan drug designations from the fda and the european medicines agency for the treatment of als 
we are also advancing a structurally distinct  fast skeletal muscle sarcomere activator  ck  in non clinical studies intended to enable the filing of an ind with the fda 
our skeletal sarcomere activators selectively activate the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex  which is a set of regulatory proteins that modulates the contractility of the fast skeletal muscle sarcomere 
in our smooth muscle contractility program  we are conducting preclinical research on compounds that directly inhibit smooth muscle myosin  the motor protein central to the contraction of smooth muscle 
these compounds cause the relaxation of contracted smooth muscle  and so may be useful as potential treatments for diseases and conditions complicated by bronchoconstriction  such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
two of our drug candidates directed to muscle contractility have now demonstrated pharmacodynamic activity in patients omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure and ck in patients with als and in patients with claudication associated with peripheral artery disease 
in  we expect to continue to focus on translating the observed pharmacodynamic activity of these compounds into potentially meaningful clinical benefits for patients 
our potential drug candidate ck has demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models 
muscle contractility programs cardiac muscle contractility our lead drug candidate from this program is omecamtiv mecarbil  a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure  including omecamtiv mecarbil 
the agreement provided amgen with a non exclusive license and access to certain technology 
the agreement also granted amgen an option to obtain an exclusive license worldwide  except japan  to develop and commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil and other drug candidates arising from the collaboration 

table of contents in may  amgen exercised its option 
in connection with the exercise of its option  amgen paid us an exercise fee of million 
as a result  amgen is now responsible for the development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and related compounds at its expense worldwide excluding japan  subject to our development and commercialization participation rights 
under the agreement  amgen will reimburse us for agreed research and development activities we perform 
the agreement provides for potential pre commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate on omecamtiv mecarbil and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration  and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement 
the agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co funding phase iii development costs of drug candidates under the collaboration 
if we elect to co fund such costs  we would be entitled to co promote omecamtiv mecarbil in north america and participate in agreed commercialization activities in institutional care settings  at amgen s expense 
we conducted a clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil comprised of multiple phase i and phase iia clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profiles of both intravenous and oral formulations in a diversity of patients  including patients with stable heart failure and patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy 
in these trials  omecamtiv mecarbil exhibited generally linear  dose proportional pharmacokinetics across the dose ranges studied 
the adverse effects observed at intolerable doses in humans appeared similar to the adverse findings which occurred in preclinical safety studies at similar plasma concentrations 
these effects are believed to be related to the mechanism of action of this drug candidate which  at intolerable doses  resulted in an excessive prolongation of the systolic ejection time ie  the time in which the heart is contracting 
however  these effects resolved promptly with discontinuation of the infusions of omecamtiv mecarbil 
we expect omecamtiv mecarbil to be developed as a potential treatment across the continuum of care in heart failure both as an intravenous formulation for use in the hospital setting and as an oral formulation for use in the outpatient setting 
atomic ahf 
in april  amgen initiated an international  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  phase iib clinical trial of an intravenous formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil  now known as atomic ahf acute treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to increase contractility in acute heart failure  in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure 
this clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately patients in three sequential  ascending dose cohorts 
the primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of hours of intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil compared to placebo on dyspnea shortness of breath in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction hospitalized for acute heart failure 
the secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil compared with placebo and to evaluate the effects of hours of treatment with intravenous omecamtiv mecarbil on additional measures of dyspnea  patients global assessments  change in n terminal pro brain type natriuretic peptide a biomarker associated with the severity of heart failure and short term clinical outcomes in these patients 
in addition  the trial will evaluate the relationship between omecamtiv mecarbil plasma concentrations and echocardiographic parameters in patients with acute heart failure 
patient dosing in the first cohort of this trial is continuing 
a review of data from the first cohort of this trial will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee 
a decision regarding the potential progression to the second cohort of the trial is anticipated in the first half of oral formulation development 
in february  amgen initiated a phase i study designed to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral formulations of omecamtiv mecarbil in healthy volunteers 
this clinical trial will be used to guide selection of an oral formulation of omecamtiv mecarbil for later stage clinical trials 
we and amgen are discussing plans for the initiation of an additional clinical trial designed to assess the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral omecamtiv mecarbil in stable heart failure patients 
next generation research 
in the fourth quarter of  we agreed with amgen to additional research activities intended to be conducted through under the research plan directed to next generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program 
under our collaboration agreement  amgen will reimburse us for the agreed research activities we perform 

table of contents the clinical trials program for omecamtiv mecarbil may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from sales of this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and the drug is commercialized 
omecamtiv mecarbil is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when this may occur 
we funded all research and development costs associated with this program prior to amgen s option exercise in may we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recognized research and development revenue from amgen of million in and million in  consisting of reimbursements of full time employee equivalent fte and other expenses 
we recognized research and development revenue from amgen of million in the  consisting of million for the transfer of our existing inventories of omecamtiv mecarbil and related reference materials to amgen and million for reimbursements of ftes and other costs 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase if we participate in the future advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen terminates development of omecamtiv mecarbil or related compounds and we elect to develop them independently  or if we elect to co fund later stage development of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen 
skeletal muscle contractility ck is the lead drug candidate from this program 
we are also advancing a potential drug candidate from this program  ck  in non clinical studies intended to enable the filing of an ind 
ck and ck are structurally distinct and selective small molecule activators of the fast skeletal sarcomere 
these compounds activate the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex by increasing its sensitivity to calcium  leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility 
we are evaluating the potential indications for which ck and ck may be useful 
each of ck and ck has demonstrated encouraging pharmacological activity in preclinical models 
in addition  with respect to ck  evidence of potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects has been observed in healthy volunteers  in patients with als  and in patients with peripheral artery disease and claudication 
in july  we were awarded a grant in the amount of approximately million by the ninds  which is intended to support for three years our research and development of ck for the potential treatment of myasthenia gravis 
the grant was awarded under the american recovery and reinvestment act of we recognized revenue of million and million under this grant arrangement in and  respectively  which we recorded as research and development  grant and other revenues 
in  we initiated three evidence of effect phase iia clinical trials of ck two of these trials have been completed  one in patients with als and one in patients with symptoms of claudication associated with peripheral artery disease 
a trial in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis is ongoing 
these studies are intended to translate the mechanism of action of ck into potentially clinically relevant pharmacodynamic effects as we did in healthy volunteers  which may then form the basis for larger clinical trials designed to demonstrate proof of concept and possibly even to support registration 
in march  ck received an orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of als 
in march  ck received an orphan medicinal product designation from the european medicines agency 
ck clinical development phase i healthy volunteers 
a phase i clinical trial of single doss of ck in healthy volunteers demonstrated the maximum tolerated single oral dose to be mg 
in addition  single doses of 
table of contents ck from to mg were shown to produce concentration dependent  statistically significant increases versus placebo in the force developed by the tibialis anterior muscles of healthy volunteers in response to transcutaneous neuronal stimulation 
in a multiple dose phase i clinical trial  ck displayed generally dose proportional pharmacokinetics and only modest accumulation during dosing to steady state 
ck was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported in these phase i trials 
als phase i drug drug interaction cy 
in  we conducted a phase i drug drug interaction study of ck administered orally to healthy volunteers 
the co administration of ck and riluzole  the current standard of care for als  approximately doubled the average maximum plasma levels of riluzole  it also reduced the variability of plasma levels of riluzole in the study subjects 
accordingly  we believe that in future ck clinical trials  a standard dose adjustment to the riluzole dose could be made for all patients receiving ck  regardless of the dose level of ck data from the part of this study investigating the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of ck administered orally indicated that ck may be best administered to patients in a fasting state 
phase iia evidence of effect cy 
in april  data from our phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial in als patients were presented at the clinical trials session at the rd annual meeting of the american academy of neurology 
in that trial  the single doses of ck evaluated appeared generally well tolerated 
in addition  both patients and investigators perceived a positive change in the patients overall status  in a dose dependent fashion  at hours after dosing with ck  based on a global assessment in which the patient and the investigator each independently assessed patients status compared to prior to dosing 
there was a clear relationship between improvements in global assessments and the ck plasma concentration 
also at this hour time point  there was a trend towards decreased muscle fatigability  as evidenced by data from a test of sub maximal hand grip endurance 
data from that clinical trial also demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the maximum volume of air patients could inhale and exhale in twelve seconds maximum voluntary ventilation at both and hours after mg of ck  and small but statistically significant increases in maximum strength of certain muscle groups tested 
phase ii multiple dose cy 
in  we initiated a two part  phase ii safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic clinical trial of multiple doses of ck in als patients 
part a of this trial  which was completed in  enrolled patients who were not taking riluzole 
part b of this trial  which is ongoing  is designed to evaluate patients who are concurrently taking riluzole 
in december  at the nd international symposium on als and motor neurone disease in sydney  australia  we presented data from part a 
ck appeared well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated which ranged from mg to mg  once daily  for two weeks 
plasma concentrations of ck increased in proportion with dose 
the incidence and persistence of dizziness appeared dose related but was mild in severity in all patients who completed study drug treatment 
most reports of dizziness began early after initiating treatment and resolved spontaneously within the first week of treatment in all but one patient who nevertheless completed the trial 
no serious adverse events were reported 
due to the small sample size  the large inter patient variability and the short  two week duration  part a of this trial lacked the statistical power to detect significant differences in clinical outcome measures 
however  trends to improved clinical outcome measures were observed  especially at the highest ck dose of mg daily 
we anticipate that data from part b of this phase ii trial will be available in the first half of phase ii dose titration cy 
in november  we initiated a phase ii  double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  ascending dose titration clinical study designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple ascending doses of ck an estimated patients with als who are also receiving riluzole are planned to be enrolled 
patients will be randomized to one of two dosing groups and receive twice daily oral ascending doses of ck or placebo 
the primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of this alternative dosing regimen of ck in patients with als 
the secondary objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate the alsfrs r  other measures 
table of contents of pulmonary function  muscle strength and fatigue  relationships between dose  plasma concentrations and functional effects and physician and patient global assessments in these patients while receiving two weeks of treatment with ck at the indicated doses or placebo 
we anticipate that data from this trial will be available in first half of claudication phase iia evidence of effect cy 
in june  at the nd annual scientific sessions of the society of vascular medicine  we presented final data from our phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial of ck in patients with symptoms of claudication associated with peripheral artery disease 
the primary objective was to demonstrate an effect of single doses of ck on measures of skeletal muscle function and fatigability in these patients 
the secondary objectives were to evaluate and characterize the relationship  if any  between the doses and plasma concentrations of ck and its pharmacodynamic effects  and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ck administered as single doses to these patients 
accordingly  in this hypothesis generating trial  multiple pharmacodynamic assessments were made without specifying a single primary pharmacodynamic endpoint 
patients were enrolled in this trial 
patients were administered single oral doses of placebo and of different dose levels of ck in a double blind fashion and in random order  at least days apart 
as evidenced by heel raise testing  ck increased calf muscle performance in these patients 
the increases in calf muscle performance and the occurrence of adverse events both appeared related to increasing dose and plasma concentrations of ck conversely  performance on a minute walk test was inversely related to increases in both the dose and plasma concentration of ck dose related adverse events  particularly dizziness and others related to walking  may explain this negative effect on minute walk performance 
the authors concluded that ck merits further study and that potential next steps could include studies to explore whether the adverse events observed  such as dizziness  might abate with repeated dosing  alternate dosing regimens and or gradual dose titration 
myasthenia gravis phase iia evidence of effect cy 
in january  we initiated our phase iia evidence of effect clinical trial of ck in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis 
at least and up to patients may be enrolled in this trial 
the primary objective of this trial is to assess the effects of ck on measures of muscle strength  muscle fatigue and pulmonary function 
the secondary objectives of this clinical trial are to evaluate and characterize the relationship  if any  between the doses and plasma concentrations of ck and its pharmacodynamic effects  to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ck administered as single doses to patients with myasthenia gravis  and to evaluate the effect of ck on investigator and patient determined global functional assessment and the modified mg symptom score  an assessment combining patient reports and physician evaluations to assess the severity of symptoms due to myasthenia gravis 
we are continuing to conduct this trial  and anticipate that data will be available from this trial in the first half of ck planned clinical development 
we have met with the fda center for drug evaluation and research s division of neurology products and with the european medicines agency to discuss the progress in the development of ck as a potential treatment for patients with als and our strategy for its further development  including potential registration strategies 
based on this discussion  we are assessing options that may enable the initiation of a registration program for ck we anticipate additional interactions in with us and european regulatory authorities to discuss the development of ck as a potential treatment for patients with als  including potential registration strategies 
ck planned development 
throughout  we progressed ck in studies intended to support an ind or foreign equivalent 
we expect to continue to conduct these studies and anticipate filing an ind for ck by the end of 
table of contents ongoing research in skeletal muscle activators 
our research on the direct activation of skeletal muscle continues in two areas 
we are conducting translational research in animal models of disease and muscle function with fast skeletal troponin activators to explore the potential clinical applications of this novel approach in preclinical studies 
we also intend to conduct preclinical research on other chemically and pharmacologically distinct mechanisms to activate the skeletal sarcomere 
ck and ck are at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from their commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance ck  ck or other compounds from this program into and through development 
smooth muscle contractility overview 
smooth muscle is a non striated form of muscle that is found in the circulatory  respiratory  digestive and genitourinary organ systems and is responsible for the contractile properties of these tissues 
the contractile elements in non striated muscle are not arranged into sarcomeres and the regulation of smooth muscle differs from that in cardiac and skeletal muscles 
smooth muscle contractility is driven by smooth muscle myosin  a cytoskeletal motor protein that is directly responsible for converting chemical energy into mechanical force 
our smooth muscle contractility program is focused on the discovery and development of small molecule smooth muscle myosin inhibitors  and leverages our expertise in muscle function and its application to drug discovery 
our inhaled smooth muscle myosin inhibitors have demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of bronchoconstrictive diseases and may have applications for indications such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
our smooth muscle myosin inhibitors  administered orally or intravenously  have also demonstrated pharmacological activity in preclinical models of vascular constriction 
we intend to continue to conduct research of compounds from this program 
ongoing research in smooth muscle myosin inhibitors 
we are continuing to conduct early research activities to develop direct smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for potential use in acute or chronic settings 
our research focus is to differentiate our compounds from existing drugs that are bronchodilators or vasodilators that act by indirectly causing smooth muscle relaxation  such as commonly used beta agonists and calcium channel blockers 
we are particularly interested in potential applications for our compounds where the benefits of currently available treatments are constrained by adverse side effects or limited effectiveness 
our smooth muscle myosin inhibitors are at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from their commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our smooth muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our smooth muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance compounds from this program into and through development 
development risks the successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to decisions made by amgen with respect to the development of omecamtiv mecarbil  
table of contents the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed  our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms  if at all  including  but not limited to  our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design  management  conduct and funding of clinical trials  delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  including variability in patient response  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates  the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility  and possible delays in the characterization  formulation and manufacture of potential drug candidates 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  and other risk factors 
revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years  if at all 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen and glaxosmithkline gsk for license fees and agreed research activities 
in december  we entered into our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  under which we received an upfront  non refundable  non exclusive license and technology access fee of million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with amgen 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to amgen for net proceeds of million  of which the million purchase premium was recorded as deferred revenue 
through may  we amortized the upfront non exclusive license and technology access fee and stock purchase premium to license revenue ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which was four years 
in june  we recognized as revenue the remaining balance of million of the related deferred revenue when amgen exercised its option  triggering the end of the non exclusive license period 
in june  we received a non refundable option exercise fee from amgen of million  which we recognized in revenue as license fees from a related party 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain pre commercialization and commercialization milestones 
none of the future contingent milestone payments pursuant to this arrangement as of january  are considered substantive as they are the results of amgen s performance 
therefore  they are not considered milestones under accounting standard codification topic  revenue recognition milestone method asc 
table of contents we have received reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we recorded as revenue as the related expenses were incurred 
we may be eligible to receive further reimbursements from amgen for agreed research and development activities  which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
revenues related to the reimbursement of ftes were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes 
revenues from gsk in were received pursuant to our strategic alliance entered into in  which was directed to the research and development of mitotic kinesin inhibitors  which was an earlier focus for us prior to our refocusing of our research and development activities on the modulation of muscle function 
these revenues were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses  which we recorded as the related expenses were incurred 
in  gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june in  we received a million milestone payment from gsk relating to its initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized in connection with this strategic alliance were non refundable  even if the relevant research effort was not successful 
we agreed with gsk to terminate this strategic alliance effective february  we have retained all rights to develop and commercialize mitotic kinesin inhibitors from the strategic alliance including ispinesib  sb and gsk  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other pre commercialization milestones under our strategic alliance with amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
if one or more of our drug candidates is approved for sale as a drug  we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to amgen under our strategic alliance and from those licensed to future partners  and from direct sales of our drugs 
we retain a product by product option to co fund certain phase iii development activities under our strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
if we exercise our co promotion rights under this strategic alliance  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure in accordance with agreed upon research and development plans with amgen 
we expect to incur research and development expenses for the continued conduct of preclinical studies and non clinical and clinical development for ck  ck and potentially other skeletal sarcomere activators for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  preclinical studies and non clinical development of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with bronchoconstriction  vascular constriction  or both  and our research programs in other disease areas 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb in november  under an amendment to our strategic alliance  we assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of ispinesib and sb  at our sole expense 

table of contents research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research and manufacturing  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our skeletal muscle contractility program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors program  million for our proprietary technologies and million for other research programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including  but not limited to  finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance 
restructuring in october  we announced a restructuring plan to realign our workforce and operations in line with our continued commitment to focus primarily on the development of our key later stage development programs for ck and omecamtiv mecarbil and on our follow on skeletal muscle troponin activator program and joint research with amgen directed to next generation compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program 
we plan to focus our resources on the partnering and advancement of ck  including the planning and initiation of a clinical trial in als patients that may potentially support registration 
we intend to retain a research and development organization focused to these programs and certain other research and development programs  also directed to muscle biology 
as a result of the restructuring plan  in  we recorded total restructuring charges of million for employee severance and benefit related costs 
we have completed substantially all restructuring activities and recognized all anticipated restructuring charges 
we expect to record only immaterial charges to the accrued restructuring costs during  primarily related to employee benefits and outplacement services 
in september  we announced a restructuring plan to realign our workforce and operations in line with a strategic reassessment of our research and development activities and corporate objectives 
we completed all restructuring activities and recognized all anticipated restructuring charges by december  stock compensation the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to stock options  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units  and employee stock purchases for  and in thousands years ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested restricted stock units  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to alternative minimum tax amt 
however  due to the department of the treasury s further guidance clarifying that utilization of the amt net operating loss nol was not limited to as part of the year nol carryback provision brought about by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  the amt liability was reversed in in addition to the  benefit related to the amt liability  we also recognized a  benefit related to the monetization of the federal research tax credit for a total benefit of approximately  in we did not record an income tax provision in the year ended december  because we had a net taxable loss in the period 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december   and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance increased by million in  increased by million in  and decreased by million in we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for the tax year and have made adjustments to our deferred balances for nol carryforwards  research credits  and charitable contribution carryovers as a result of information obtained from the irs examination 
as we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the adjustments resulted in no additional tax expense in the current period 
we have also adjusted our unrealized tax benefits accordingly 
however  in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
we had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million and state nol carryforwards of approximately million before federal benefit at december  if not utilized  the federal and state nol carryforwards will begin to expire in various amounts beginning and  respectively 
the nol carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
when utilized  the portion related to stock option deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and california state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change nol and tax credits to offset future taxable income 
our existing nols and tax credits are subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes 
future changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code and result in additional limitations 
during the year ended december   we conducted a study and determined that we would not be able to utilize a portion of 
table of contents our federal research credit as a result of such a restriction 
accordingly  we reduced our deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance by million 
as a result  the research credit amount as of december  reflects the restriction on our ability to use the credit 
accounting guidance for income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
it also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the unrecognized tax benefits on our research credits are based on our evaluation of the underlying research expenditures 
we have reduced the respective deferred tax assets and valuation allowance to reflect the unrecognized tax benefits 
these adjustments did not have an impact on the income tax expense as we maintained a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties were zero for and we account for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next twelve months

the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain and maintain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

auction rate securities ars 
our short term investments at december  included at par value million of ars 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  these ars experienced multiple failed auctions beginning in february  as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result  the ars ceased to be liquid 
the fair values of the ars as of december  were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis

we plan to continue to conduct non clinical development of our fast skeletal troponin activator ck and  following clearance of an ind  clinical development 
we plan to progress one or more of our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds through non clinical and clinical development 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our other compounds from our muscle contractility programs through research to candidate selection 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  non clinical development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil or other compounds for the potential treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates  the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development of drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities  including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  
table of contents the expansion and advancement of our research programs  the hiring of additional employees and consultants  the expansion of our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million since inception and there can be no assurance that we will attain profitability 
we are subject to risks common to development stage companies including  but not limited to  development of new drug candidates  dependence on key personnel  and the ability to obtain additional capital as needed to fund our future plans 
our liquidity will be impaired if sufficient additional capital is not available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our common stock and convertible preferred stock  contract payments under our collaboration agreements  debt financing arrangements  government grants and interest income 
until we achieve profitable operations  we intend to continue to fund operations through payments from strategic collaborations  additional sales of equity securities  government grants and debt financings 
we have never generated revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever 
our success is dependent on our ability to obtain additional capital by entering into new strategic collaborations and or through equity or debt financings  and ultimately on our and our collaborators ability to successfully develop and market one or more of our drug candidates 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available from such collaborators or financings when needed or on satisfactory terms 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any of drugs based on our drug candidates will be accepted in the marketplace or that any future products can be developed or manufactured at an acceptable cost 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results  financial position and cash flows 
based on the current status of our development plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investments and interest earned on investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates or of other research and development programs 
alternatively  we might raise funds through strategic relationships  public or private financings or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all  or in accordance with our planned timelines 
furthermore  financing obtained through future strategic relationships may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates 
similarly  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investments available for sale and trading investments 
our investments have consisted of ars  municipal and government agency bonds  commercial paper  us treasury securities  and money market funds 
we designated all investments  except for our ars held by ubs  as available for sale 
therefore  they are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we reclassified our ars held by ubs from available for sale to trading securities 
investments that we designate as trading assets are reported at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
see notes to financial statements note cash equivalents and investments for further detailed discussion 
investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
other than temporary impairment 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
factors considered by management in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred include the nature of the investment  whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment  the financial condition of the investee  the severity and the duration of the impairment  and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
when we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other than temporary decline occurred 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in other income or expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest and other  net 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third 
table of contents parties for agreed research and development activities  may include non refundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our collaborations prior to january  with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there was vendor specific objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we received was allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria were applied to each of the separate units 
the consideration we received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met 
on january   accounting standard codification asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc on the recognition of revenues for agreements with multiple deliverables became effective and applies to any agreements we may enter into on or after january  under this updated guidance  revenue will be allocated to each element using a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
asc established the milestone method as an acceptable method of revenue recognition for certain contingent event based payments under research and development arrangements 
under the milestone method  a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is an event i that can be achieved based in whole or in part on either our performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
the determination that a milestone is substantive is based on management s judgment and is made at the inception of the arrangement 
milestones are considered substantive when the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is i commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
other contingent event based payments received for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the results of a collaborative partner s performance are not considered milestones under asc in accordance with asc  such payments will be recognized as revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
prior to january   we recognized milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions were not met  we deferred the milestone payment and recognized it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we completed our performance obligations 
we have concluded that all of the future contingent milestone payments pursuant to our research and development arrangements entered into as of january  are not considered substantive as they are the results of a collaborative partner s performance 
therefore  they are not considered milestones under asc research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are negotiated rates that are based upon our costs  and which we believe approximate fair value 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue 
table of contents arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we evaluate the payments to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
funds received from third parties under grant arrangements are recorded as revenue if we are deemed to be the principal participant in the grant arrangement as the activities under the grant are part of our development programs 
if we are not the principal participant  the grant funds are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
grant funds received are not refundable and are recognized when the related qualified research and development costs are incurred and when there is reasonable assurance that the funds will be received 
funds received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed utilizing third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation we apply the accounting guidance for stock compensation  which establishes the accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
under the guidance for stock compensation for non employees  we measure the fair value of the award each period until the award is fully vested 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates at the time  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if conditions change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and 
table of contents liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in due to amt 
however  due to the department of the treasury s further guidance clarifying that utilization of the amt nol was not limited to as part of the year nol carryback provision brought about by the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  the amt liability was reversed in in addition to the  benefit related to the amt liability  we also recognized a  benefit related to the monetization of the federal research tax credit for a total benefit of approximately  in we did not record an income tax provision in the year ended december  because we had a net taxable loss in the period 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results  we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets as of december   and the valuation allowance was determined pursuant to the accounting guidance for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance increased by million in  increased by million in  and decreased by million in we also follow the accounting guidance that defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
we are currently under examination by the irs for the tax year and have made adjustments to our deferred balances for nol carryforwards  research credits  and charitable contribution carryovers as a result of information obtained from the irs examination 
as we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the adjustments resulted in no additional tax expense in the current period 
we have also adjusted our unrealized tax benefits accordingly 
however  in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for the purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties were zero for and we account for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next twelve months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our 
table of contents investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest the majority of our excess cash in us treasuries and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure in any one issuer and investment class  with the exception of obligations of the us treasury and federal agencies  for which there are no such limits 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by attempting to limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us bonds and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short and long term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our equipment financing lines and investment portfolio dollars in thousands beyond total fair value at december  assets investments average interest rate liabilities equipment financing lines average interest rate
