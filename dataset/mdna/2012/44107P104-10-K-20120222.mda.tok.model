item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview host inc operates as a self managed and self administered reit 
host inc is the sole general partner of host lp and holds of its partnership interests 
host lp is a limited partnership operating through an umbrella partnership structure 
as of february   we own hotels  primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties 
host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareit s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are luxury and upper upscale that are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort conference hotels 
while our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy should allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business and contract business  which accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our room sales 
similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels 
therefore  we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the three key subcategories of the transient business group are retail this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it typically is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates 
it includes the rack rate  which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs 
weekend stays 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate 
discount this category encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 
group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
the three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 

table of contents other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements  pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other hotel level expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  which distribution reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation 
revenues for owned hotels represent of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  entertainment and other guest services 
hotel operating expenses represent approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 

table of contents of operating costs and expenses other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenues  such as parking  golf courses  spas  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items 
taken separately  these costs represent approximately of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators 
revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it generally is considered the key indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels  as well as incremental operating profit  than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage revenue  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in additional room related costs  with the exception of those charged as a percentage of revenue 
as a result  changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels 
in discussing our operating results  we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage or large scale capital improvements 
we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non gaap financial measures 
each of these non gaap financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit  net income and earnings per share 
we provide a more detailed discussion of these non gaap financial measures  how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in non gaap financial measures 
our non gaap financial measures include nareit funds from operations ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share 
we use nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
nareit adopted ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we also 
table of contents adjust nareit ffo for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt  acquisition costs and litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business  which we believe provides useful supplemental information about our ongoing operating performance 
hotel adjusted operating profit 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service  depreciation and corporate expenses and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property level profitability 
we use hotel adjusted operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
earnings before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization ebitda  is a commonly used measure in many industries 
management believes that such measure provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations as it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we adjust ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain items  such as gains and losses related to real estate transactions and impairment losses adjusted ebitda  provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance

while the recovery in the overall economy has been slower than we expected  marked the second year of solid growth in the lodging industry as increases in business investment and corporate profits  as well as low levels of new supply  offset the effects of lower than anticipated gdp growth and continued high unemployment 
as expected during the recovery process  initially the growth in revpar was driven primarily by improvements in occupancy 
during  as occupancy approached more normalized levels  revpar growth was driven increasingly by increases in average rates 
for  revpar growth reflects the increase in average daily rates  and an occupancy improvement of percentage points 
the revpar growth of our properties was tempered  however  by the effects of major capital projects that were on going throughout the year  particularly those at some of our largest properties  such as the sheraton new york hotel towers and the philadelphia marriott downtown 
revpar would have increased an additional basis points for the full year if the results of these two properties were excluded 
combined with the improvements in revpar  total owned hotel revenues increased due to the inclusion of the operations of hotels acquired in and the recent acquisitions  which increased revenues by million and million  respectively 

table of contents rate increases for the year have been driven primarily by increases in transient business across all segments in the category  as well as improvements in corporate group business 
group demand has recovered more slowly as weak association group demand has offset the improvement in corporate group demand 
food and beverage revenue for increased by compared to  which increase was driven by a improvement in comparable hotel food and beverage revenue and incremental food and beverage revenues from our recent acquisitions of million  or for the year 
improvements in banquet and audio visual revenue were a significant driver of the growth in comparable food and beverage revenues 
as a result of these trends  total comparable revenues for our owned hotels increased million  or  to approximately billion for the year 
in addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above  our other revenues increased million due to incremental revenue from the courtyard by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust that previously had been sublet the hpt portfolio  see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
therefore  total revenues increased million  or  to approximately billion for operating margins calculated based on gaap operating profit as a percentage of gaap revenues increased basis points for the full year operating margins calculated using gaap measures are significantly affected by several items  including our recent acquisitions 
our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins  which exclude  among other items  operations from our recently acquired hotels  depreciation and corporate expenses  increased basis points 
net loss for host inc decreased million in to a loss of million and adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to  million 
net loss  gaap operating profit and adjusted ebitda all were affected negatively by the forfeiture of the million deposit on the terminated transaction to acquire the grand hyatt  washington  dc in december host inc s diluted loss per common share decreased 
to a loss in of 
the reduction in our loss per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above 
host inc s nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share of 
and  respectively  increased and for for  the million deposit forfeiture discussed above reduced nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share by 
the trends and transactions described above for host inc similarly affected the operating results for host l 
p  as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year  host lp s net loss declined million to million  and the loss per diluted unit declined 
to 
per unit 
investing activities acquisitions 
we believe that the lodging industry continues to present opportunities to purchase assets with high growth potential at a significant discount to replacement cost 
many of the prospective acquisition opportunities are expected to be driven by debt maturities on over leveraged assets that were refinanced in and as owners may look to sell as they face refinancing challenges with lower loan to value ratios and higher interest rates 
in many cases  we expect that these owners will seek to meet their financing obligations through an all cash sale of the hotel 
as the recovery continues  we expect to see more competition in the acquisition market  especially from private equity and foreign sovereign wealth firms 
during  we completed the following acquisitions on september   we acquired the remaining partnership interest in the tiburon golf ventures  lp  which owns the golf club surrounding the ritz carlton  naples golf resort  for million 
we previously held a limited partner interest in the entity 
on april   we acquired a common voting interest and a preferred interest in the joint venture that owns the room hilton melbourne south wharf  australia 
the total transaction value  including 
table of contents the voting interest retained by the previous owners  was a million million and included the assumption of an existing a million million mortgage loan 
we are entitled to receive a cumulative priority return of based on our initial investment of a million million plus of the distributable cash after our partner s subordinated preferred interest 
on march  we acquired the room new york helmsley hotel for million 
the property is managed by starwood and will be converted to the westin brand in on march   we acquired the  room manchester grand hyatt san diego for million which includes the payment of million for the existing ff e replacement fund 
the transaction was comprised of cash consideration of million  including the repayment of million of existing loans and the issuance of approximately million op units valued at million 
on february   we acquired a portfolio of seven midscale and upscale hotels totaling  rooms in new zealand for approximately nz million million  at which time we entered into an nz million million mortgage 
the properties are operated by accor under the ibis and novotel brands 
also during the year  as part of the expansion of the euro jv  we transferred the le m ridien piccadilly to fund ii thereof and received proceeds from the transfer of million 
fund ii also purchased the pullman bercy  paris in for approximately million million 
redevelopment and return on investment capital expenditures 
during and  we invested a total of million and million  respectively  in redevelopment and roi expenditures that primarily consisted of large scale redevelopment projects at numerous properties 
we expect that our investment in redevelopment and roi expenditures in will total approximately million to million 
significant redevelopment capital expenditures during the year included the following projects sheraton new york hotel towers the complete renovation of all  rooms  as well as major mechanical upgrades to the heating and cooling system  atlanta marriott perimeter center complete redevelopment of the hotel  including rooms renovation  lobby enhancements  mechanical systems upgrades  parking garage and exterior enhancements  chicago marriott o hare complete redevelopment of the hotel  including rooms renovation  new meeting space and the creation of a new great room and lobby  san diego marriott marquis marina continuation of the extensive renovation and redevelopment project begun in  and sheraton indianapolis renovation of rooms  lobby  fitness center  bar and restaurant  as well as the conversion of an existing tower into apartments 
included in our roi expenditures are capital projects at our recently acquired hotels that we considered as part of our initial investment 
in  acquisition capital expenditures accounted for million of our roi capital expenditures as we began the renovation of all rooms at the w new york union square and the rebranding of the new york helmsley hotel to a westin  including a redesign of all rooms and a new lobby bar and restaurant 
these projects will continue in and will include the planned renovation of all of the guestrooms at the manchester grand hyatt san diego 
during  we anticipate that these projects will account for million to million of our roi expenditures 
renewal and replacement capital expenditures 
in addition to the redevelopment roi expenditures described above  we spent million and million on renewal and replacement expenditures during and  respectively 
during  our renewal and replacement projects included the renovation of over  rooms   square feet of public space and  square feet of meeting space 
these expenditures are 
table of contents designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace 
major projects completed in included the renovation of the  square foot broadway ballroom and rooms at the new york marriott marquis  over  square feet of meeting space and  rooms in the main tower of the philadelphia marriott downtown and  square feet of meeting space at the sheraton boston 
major renewal and replacement projects that were underway during the fourth quarter of included all rooms at the jw marriott desert springs and  square feet of meeting space at the new orleans marriott 
we expect our investment in renewal and replacement expenditures in will total approximately million to million 
dispositions 
we disposed of one non core property in for proceeds of million 
during  we plan to increase our disposition activity  subject to market conditions that remain challenging 
we believe that transaction activity will increase as the year progresses and we remain committed to our strategy of reducing our exposure to non core hotels located in secondary and tertiary markets 
we also will consider selling properties in primary markets on an opportunistic basis 
financing activities during  we continued to make progress in our goal to strengthen the balance sheet by lowering our debt to equity ratio and improving our overall credit statistics  as defined in our credit facility and senior note indentures 
as our operations have improved during and  we have focused on strategically raising and deploying capital to improve our overall leverage ratios  while at the same time completing substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments 
specifically  during the year we completed the following significant financing transactions 
we issued million of series y senior notes and million of series w senior notes for aggregate net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the senior notes issuances were used to redeem or repay million of debt  including the remaining million of series k senior notes  million of exchangeable senior debentures and million under our credit facility 
additionally  we intend to use the proceeds from the issuance of the series y senior notes  along with available cash  to redeem the remaining million of our exchangeable senior debentures the debentures on april   at which time they can be put to us for cash by the holders 
in june  holders of million of our exchangeable debentures the debentures elected to exchange their debentures for million common shares of host inc upon our notice of intent to redeem million of the debentures in may 
the remaining million was paid in cash 
we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility that replaced our existing senior revolving credit facility that allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to billion  an increase of million 
the interest rate spread for libor based borrowings ranges from to basis points 
the spread on us dollar based borrowings based on our credit statistics as of december  is basis points 
the new facility has an initial maturity of november with an option to extend for one additional year  subject to certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee 
we refinanced the million mortgage loan that we had assumed as part of the acquisition of the hilton melbourne south wharf  lowering the all in interest rate by basis points to 
we issued million common shares under our at the market offering programs 
the shares were issued at an average price of per share for net proceeds of million 
proceeds from these issuances were used to fund acquisitions and capital investments 
we believe  based on the overall strength of our balance sheet  that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our near term debt maturities  fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities for a detailed discussion  see liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents outlook while the uncertain economic conditions and the european sovereign debt crisis will clearly impact our business  we believe that  other than in europe  lodging demand will continue to grow based on a number of positive signs 
these signs include consensus estimates for us gdp growth of in  coupled with expected increases in business investment  a key driver for the lodging industry  rising corporate profit and slight improvements in employment 
we believe the combination of these factors will result in solid growth in the lodging industry in as the recovery continues  we anticipate that improvements in revpar will be driven by increases in both rate and occupancy  though rate growth likely will be the key driver 
at the same time  we also anticipate that supply growth in the lodging industry will continue to remain at historically low levels in as the disruption in the credit markets and weak lodging performance caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts over the last two years 
this decline particularly may be relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with luxury and upper upscale lodging properties in urban and resort destinations 
as a result  we believe that supply growth should remain below the historical trend for the lodging industry for  resulting in occupancy gains that will have a positive effect on revenues and cash flow growth 
based on the trends discussed above and the forecast redevelopment and roi projects  as well as other capital expenditures at our properties  we anticipate that comparable hotel revpar will increase to during we believe that the positive trends in the lodging industry create the opportunity for business improvements  which  when combined with our strategy to enhance our portfolio through acquisitions and capital projects  ultimately will improve the competitive position of our properties and increase stockholder value 
however  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns

results in our mountain region were mixed  as the denver market experienced a increase in revpar primarily due to strong group and transient demand  while the phoenix market experienced a decline in revpar  which was partially attributable to the renovation of a significant amount of meeting space at two hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the westin kierland 
our dc metro region underperformed the portfolio in terms of revpar growth  which underperformance reflects difficult comparisons to the prior year  particularly during the first quarter  due to the presidential inauguration and other government related activities 

table of contents hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which information is available from our managers 
in  overall transient revenues increased when compared to  reflecting an increase in total room nights of  and an increase in average rates of 
the rate increase was driven primarily by a increase in average rate for corporate transient business and a shift in mix away from discounted business 
during  group revenues increased approximately  reflecting an increase in total room nights of  partially offset by a decrease in average rates of 
typically  recovery in the group segment will follow improvement in transient demand due to longer booking lead times 
as a result  a large portion of the group business was sold at the lower rates in effect in prior periods 
therefore  while we did experience improvements in group demand  improvements in overall group revenue continues to lag that of transient revenue 
property level operating expenses change to change to in millions in millions rooms food and beverage other departmental and support expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level operating expenses compared to and compared to our operating costs and expenses  both of which are fixed and variable  are affected by a number of factors 
as previously discussed  room expense is affected mainly by occupancy  which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
food and beverage expense correlates closely with food and beverage revenues  and is affected by occupancy as well as the type of customers staying at the hotel 
however  the most significant expense for both room expense and food and beverage expense is related to wages and employee benefits  which comprise approximately of these expenses in any year 
other property level expenses consist of property taxes  which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities  and property and general liability insurance  and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
the overall increases in operating expenses in and are consistent with higher overall revpar at our properties and increases in occupancy and rates at our hotels 
the increase also is a result of the inclusion of expenses for recent acquisitions  which were million and million in and  respectively 
property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented  which costs are included in discontinued operations 
rooms 
the increase in rooms expenses reflects a increase in expenses at our comparable hotels  due primarily to higher wages  benefits  travel agent commissions and reservations expenses  as well as the increase in occupancy during the year 
rooms expense also increased due to the inclusion of an incremental million in expenses from our recent acquisitions 
the increase in rooms expenses in was consistent with the overall increase in occupancy during the year and higher wage costs 
food and beverage 
the increase in food and beverage expenses at our hotels reflects a increase at our comparable hotels due to increases in food and beverage business  however  the overall productivity for the department improved 
food and beverage expense also increased due to the inclusion of an incremental million in expenses from our recent acquisitions 
the increase in food and beverage costs in reflects the increase in revenues  partially offset by the positive shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio visual revenues 
however  for  weak productivity in banquet sales hurt overall profitability 

table of contents other departmental and support expenses 
the increase in other departmental and support expenses in resulted from the recent acquisitions  along with increases in sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
the increase in revenues drove an increase in non controllable hotel expenses during  such as credit card commissions  bonus expense  loyalty rewards program expenses and cluster and shared service allocations 
management fees 
our base management fees  which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues  increased for and in  which is a result of the increase in revenues at our comparable hotels  as well as the inclusion of management fees for our recent acquisitions 
the incentive management fees  which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has received a priority return on its investment  increased in and in  consistent with the increase in operating profit at those properties earning the incentive fees 
other property level expenses 
these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance 
for and  the increase was driven primarily by the inclusion of the hpt hotel expenses discussed below 
for  expenses for hotels leased from hpt include rental expense of million due to hpt  as well as million of hotel expenses 
for  expenses for hotels leased from hpt include rental expense of million due to hpt  as well as the million of hotel expenses incurred subsequent to the sublease termination 
for  expenses for hotels leased from hpt represent rental expense due to hpt of million 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation expense in is due to the inclusion of depreciation expense for newly acquired properties and recent capital expenditures 
the decline in depreciation expense in is due to impairment charges of approximately million recorded in other income statement line items corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs  such as employee stock based compensation expense  travel  corporate insurance  legal fees  acquisition related costs  audit fees  building rent and systems costs 
corporate expenses increased approximately million in due to the million loss on the forfeited deposit for the grand hyatt washington  dc transaction and the accrual of million of additional litigation costs  which was largely offset by the decline in employee stock compensation 
the stock based compensation is based on employee performance  as well as host inc s stockholder return relative to other reits and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in host inc s stock price 
corporate expenses decreased million in compared to the decrease primarily was due to litigation costs of million accrued in for a potential litigation loss 
the decrease was offset partially by an increase in stock based compensation expense and bonus accruals  as they returned to more normalized levels in  and an increase of million due to costs associated with consummated property acquisitions 
gain on insurance settlement 
during  we recorded a gain of million related to the receipt of business interruption insurance for our two properties in christchurch  new zealand  both of which were affected by an earthquake in february the two properties were damaged substantially and remain closed 
we believe the property damage is covered under our insurance policy 
we recorded a gain on insurance settlement of million in for business interruption insurance related to our two hotels in chile  both of which were affected by the earthquake in july interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense during is due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with debt extinguishments including the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts  which totaled million in  compared to million in after adjusting for debt extinguishment  interest expense was comparable to levels 
in addition  savings from the fixed to floating interest rate swap that we entered into in the second half of for our million mortgage on the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel spa reduced interest expense by million for and and million in 
table of contents the increase in interest expense during from is due primarily to costs associated with debt extinguishments totaling million  compared to a net gain of million on debt extinguishments in this increase was offset partially by a net decrease in our overall debt balance  which resulted in interest savings of approximately million 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
the increase in earnings of affiliates during primarily is due to the inclusion of the operations of the le m ridien piccadilly and the pullman paris bercy in fund ii of the euro jv and also reflects a growth in revpar at the comparable hotels within the joint venture due to rate improvements 
in  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in the euro jv exceeded its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million  which significantly decreased equity in earnings losses of affiliates for  particularly when compared to and benefit for income taxes 
we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes 
the difference between hotel level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss  on which we record an income tax provision or benefit 
the decrease in the tax benefit in each of and reflects year over year improvements in property operations recognized by our trs  as well as increases in foreign taxes in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of one hotel disposed of in  two hotels disposed of in and six hotels disposed of in and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the indicated periods 
the following table summarizes the revenues  loss before taxes  and the gain loss on dispositions  net of tax  of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition for the periods presented in millions revenues loss before taxes gain loss on dispositions  net of tax liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are derived primarily from the activities of host lp host lp generates the capital required by our business through its operations  the direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness and the issuance of op units 
host inc is a reit and its only material asset is the ownership of partnership interests of host lp  therefore  its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp  except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock 
proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units 
additionally  funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore  while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp  we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources of each entity as the discussion below can be applied to both host inc and host lp overview 
we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash  debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility  given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry 
during  as operations have improved  we maintained our focus on strategically decreasing our debt to equity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments  the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances  and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt to extend maturity dates and lower interest rates 
we also look to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing  primarily senior notes  exchangeable debentures and corporate credit facility draws  as well as mortgage debt 
generally  this means that we will look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt  minimize near term maturities  and maintain a balanced maturity schedule 
as of december   of our hotels were unencumbered by mortgage debt and approximately of our debt consists of senior notes  exchangeable 
table of contents debentures and borrowings under our credit facility  all of which are not collateralized by specific hotel properties 
additionally  our maturities for are of our total debt million of senior notes and million of exchangeable debentures 
we also entered into a new senior revolving credit facility that expanded our revolving borrowing capacity to billion and has an initial maturity of november as a result  our liquidity position remains very strong  with approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available capacity under our credit facility 
as a result of the current operating environment and the flexibility provided by our credit facility  we anticipate that over time we will reduce our available cash balances closer to the million to million level 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio  withstand declines in operating cash flow  pay our near term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs 
we may continue to access the capital markets if favorable conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs

we use cash primarily for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses  as well as dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders 
as a reit  host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain  on an annual basis 
funds used by host inc to make cash distributions are provided by host lp our primary sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances 

table of contents below is a schedule of our debt maturities through as of december   our weighted average interest rate is and our weighted average maturity is years 
see financial condition for more information on our debt maturities 
during  we took advantage of lower interest rates to issue new debt and used the proceeds to repay near term maturities  resulting in the issuance of approximately million of senior notes and mortgage debt  that has been or will be used to fund the repayment or redemption of million of senior notes and exchangeable debentures including the million of debentures that we expect to be put to us in april of and million of mortgage debt

the million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at december  our exchangeable senior debentures are due in  but are subject to a put option by the holders on april  the million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at december  this mortgage can be extended for one year  at our option  provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met 
capital resources 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  which was a decrease of million from december  we also had million available under our credit facility at december  as of december   our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately billion  which represents approximately of our overall indebtedness  and is secured by of our hotels 
we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
as a result  the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure 
therefore  our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt  make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants  which include  among other things  the allowable amounts of leverage  interest coverage and fixed charges 
during and  we have decreased our near term debt maturities  expanded our borrowing capacity under our senior revolving credit facility and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants 
if  at any time  we determine that market conditions are favorable  after taking into account our liquidity requirements  we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings  including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange nyse under our existing or a future at the market offering program  or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock 
we also may seek to cause host lp to issue debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes 
given our total debt level and maturity schedule  we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time  taking advantage of favorable market conditions 
in february of  host inc s board of directors authorized repurchases up to million of senior notes  exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms 
separately  the board of directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of million principal amount of our exchangeable debentures 
any redemption of the exchangeable debentures will not reduce the million of board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities 
we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities 
table of contents pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
accordingly  in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile  and given the movement in prevailing conditions in the capital markets and relative pricing  we may  at any time  subject to applicable securities laws  be considering  or be in discussions with respect to  the purchase or sale of common stock  exchangeable debentures and or senior notes 
any such transactions may  subject to applicable securities laws  occur simultaneously 
on april   host inc entered into a new sales agency financing agreement with bny mellon capital markets  llc  through which host inc may issue and sell  from time to time  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
the agreement followed the completion of million of sales under a similar agreement  also with bny mellon capital markets  inc  that was entered into in the sales will be made in at the market offerings under sec rules  including sales made directly on the nyse 
bny mellon capital markets  llc is acting as sales agent 
host inc is not under an obligation to sell any shares 
during  we issued million shares  through this new program and the remaining capacity of the program  at an average price of per share  for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we have million of capacity remaining under this program 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk  which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price 
we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact  if any  of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions  access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts 
our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited 
our exposure with regard to our cash and the million available under our credit facility is mitigated  as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions 
at december   the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions 
sources and uses of cash 
during  our sources of cash included cash from operations  proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale or transfer of assets 
uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions  investments in our joint ventures  capital expenditures  operating costs  debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders 
during  we anticipate that our primary uses of cash will include acquisitions and investments  capital expenditures at our hotels  the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near term and distributions to equity holders 
we anticipate that our primary sources of cash for will include cash from operations and proceeds from equity and debt issuances and hotel dispositions 
cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations for increased million to million compared to due to improvements in our gaap operating profit  after adjusting for non cash items  which primarily consist of depreciation expense 
cash used in investing activities 
approximately billion of cash was used in investing activities during this included approximately billion of acquisitions  which is net of debt and other liabilities assumed and million of capital expenditures 
we also invested approximately million of cash in our unconsolidated joint ventures  which was offset partially by the million of proceeds we received for the transfer of the le m ridien piccadilly to the euro jv fund ii 
during  we purchased hotel assets located in new york  san diego  melbourne  australia  and four cities in new zealand for an aggregate amount of approximately billion 
we recognized the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interests in the acquiree at the fair value on the acquisition date 
while we continue to actively explore potential acquisitions  given the nature of the transactions  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotel properties that we may review  bid on or negotiate to purchase 
we may acquire additional properties through various structures  including transactions involving single assets  portfolios  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets 
table of contents of other reits 
we anticipate that future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from equity offerings of host inc  or issuance of op units by host lp  but potentially also from the proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio  the incurrence of debt  available cash or advances under our credit facility 
in  total capital expenditures increased million to million 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for were approximately million  which reflects an increase of approximately from levels 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically funded with approximately of property revenues and by our available cash 
we also spent approximately million in on roi redevelopment projects  which reflects an increase of approximately compared to levels  as these projects include some of our largest hotels 
capital expenditures have totaled approximately billion over the past five years 
as a result  we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors

senior notes 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp pledges and guarantees 
under the senior notes indenture  all host lp subsidiaries which guarantee host lp debt similarly are required to guarantee debt issuances under the indenture 
also  to the extent the equity of any subsidiaries of host lp are pledged to secure borrowings under the credit facility  such collateral is likewise required to secure senior note issuances under the senior notes indenture 
because both the pledges and guarantees supporting the prior credit facility were released upon entering into the new senior bank credit facility in november  the collateral pledges and guarantees that benefited ratably host lp s senior notes also were released  such that all existing and future issuances of senior notes under the senior notes indenture similarly are on an unsecured basis and do not have the benefit of any subsidiary guarantees 
while the current credit facility initially does not include any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests  they subsequently will be required in the event that host lp s leverage ratio exceeds x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating 
in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered  the guarantees and pledges would benefit ratably the credit facility  as well as the senior notes issued under the senior notes indenture and certain hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x 
this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters  giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded in related to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture  however  in certain circumstances  we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
these unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants unless they are 
table of contents guarantors and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture 
if we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries  neither the ebitda generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these entities would be included in our ratio calculations 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  host inc s ability to pay dividends and host lp s ability to make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values  excluding intangible assets  and maintaining secured indebtedness and subsidiary indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions  we still are permitted to incur certain types of debt  including i credit facility debt  ii refinancing debt  iii up to million or million  depending on the series of senior notes  of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount  and iv up to million or million  depending on the series of senior notes  of other debt 
we also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc s reit status 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as host lp s ability to make distributions on  redeem or repurchase its op units  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets defined in the indenture as undepreciated property book value of not less than of the aggregate amount of unsecured indebtedness 
this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above whose consequences  where we fall below the coverage level  are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions  but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture 
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the senior notes indenture 
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture as of december  actual ratio covenant requirement unencumbered assets tests minimum ratio of total indebtedness to total assets maximum ratio of secured indebtedness to total assets maximum ratio of ebitda to interest coverage ratio x minimum ratio of x exchangeable debentures 
as of december   we have three series of exchangeable senior debentures outstanding million of debentures that were issued on december  the debentures  million of debentures that were issued on march  the debentures and million of debentures that were issued on march  the debentures 
we refer to these collectively as the debentures

if  at any time  we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price  we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price 
the exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host inc s common stock 
upon exchange  the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock  the debentures would be exchanged for a combination of cash for the principal balance of the debentures and host inc s common stock for the remainder of the exchange value and the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock  cash or a combination thereof  at our option

on november   we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  jpmorgan chase bank  na  as syndication agent  wells fargo bank  na  deutsche bank ag new york branch and the bank of nova scotia as co documentation agents  and certain other agents and lenders 
the new credit facility replaces our existing senior revolving credit facility which would have expired in september the new credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to billion  including a foreign currency subfacility for canadian dollars  australian dollars  new zealand dollars  japanese yen  euros and british pounds sterling of up to the foreign currency equivalent of million  subject to a lower amount in the case of new zealand dollar borrowings 
the credit facility also provides a subfacility of up to million for swingline borrowings and a subfacility of up to million for issuances of letters of credit 
host lp also has the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility by up to million  subject to obtaining additional loan commitments and satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity of november  with an option for host lp to extend the term for one additional year  subject to certain conditions  including the payment of an extension fee 
at december   we 
table of contents have million of remaining available capacity under our credit facility 
the amounts that remained outstanding at the time we entered into the new credit facility were transferred over to the new credit facility and remain outstanding 
collateral and guarantees 
the credit facility does not initially require any subsidiary guarantees or pledges of equity interests in our subsidiaries  and the guarantees and pledges are required only in the event that host lp s leverage ratio exceeds x for two consecutive fiscal quarters at a time that host lp does not have an investment grade long term unsecured debt rating 
in the event that such guarantee and pledge requirement is triggered  the guarantees and pledges would ratably benefit the credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under host lp s senior notes indenture  interest rate and currency hedges and certain other hedging and bank product arrangements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
even when triggered  the guarantees and pledges only would be required by certain us and canadian subsidiaries of host lp and a substantial portion of our subsidiaries would provide neither guarantees nor pledges of equity interests 
prepayments 
voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid in the event that asset sales reduce adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values to below billion if we do not reinvest the proceeds of those assets sales in new investments 
at december   we have adjusted total assets  as defined in our credit facility  of billion 
financial covenants 
the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage 
currently  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio is not in excess of x  our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than x 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
hence  so long as there are no amounts outstanding  we would not be in default if we do not satisfy the financial covenants and we do not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants 
these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters  giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and non cash interest expense due to the implementation in of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept  under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of million are deducted from our total debt balance 
we are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility 
the following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility as of december  actual ratio covenant requirement for all years leverage ratio x maximum ratio of x fixed charge coverage ratio x minimum ratio of x unsecured interest coverage ratio a x minimum ratio of x a if at any time our leverage ratio is above x  our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to x 
interest and fees 
we pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to libor plus a margin either i ranging from to basis points depending on host lp s consolidated leverage ratio  or ii following the date on which host lp s long term unsecured debt rating is investment grade and host lp elects ratings based pricing  ranging from to basis points depending on host lp s unsecured long term debt rating 
based on our leverage ratio at december  of x  we would be able to borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points 
while we are using leverage based pricing  to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of to basis points  depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period 
upon attainment of 
table of contents an investment grade unsecured debt rating and election of ratings based pricing  in lieu of paying an unused commitment fee  we instead would pay a facility fee ranging from basis points to basis points  depending on our rating and regardless of usage 
other covenants and events of default 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments  dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions generally are consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host inc s tax status as a reit 
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature  and provides that  upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  payment of all amounts payable under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders commitments may be terminated 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default  all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
mortgage and other debt

additionally  we have non controlling interests in partnerships and joint ventures that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method 
the portion of the mortgage and other debt of these partnerships and joint ventures attributable to us  based on our percentage of ownership thereof  was million at december  this debt balance primarily is attributable to our approximate one third ownership interest in the euro jv 
the mortgage debt related to the hotels owned by our euro jv contains operating covenants that could result in the joint venture being required to escrow cash from operations or make principal repayments without penalty 
the debt of all of our unconsolidated partnerships or ventures is non recourse to us

distribution dividend policy 
host inc is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash 
funds used by host inc to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host lp as of february   host inc is the owner of approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
each op unit may be offered for redemption by the holders thereof for cash or  at the election of host inc  host inc 
common stock based on the then current conversion ratio 
the current conversion ratio was adjusted from to shares of host inc common stock for each op unit as a result of host inc s special dividend in  of which was paid in shares of host inc common stock 
this adjustment was made to avoid any unintended dilution as a result of the portion of host inc s dividend paid in common stock to its stockholders 
investors should take into account the non controlling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders  as these holders of op units share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units 
for example  if host inc paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on the payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc  as well as to other common op unitholders 
during  host inc s board of directors declared dividends of per share beginning in first quarter at and increasing by each quarter thereafter on host inc s common stock 
accordingly  host lp made a distribution of per unit on its common op units 
host inc s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its taxable income 
host inc intends to declare a dividend of per share in the first quarter of the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host inc s board of directors

we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements  under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements european joint venture 
we have general and limited partner interests in the euro jv that consists of two separate funds with apg strategic real estate pool nv  an affiliate of a dutch pension fund  and jasmine hotels pte ltd  an affiliate of the real estate investment company of the government of singapore investment corporation pte ltd gic re 
we serve as the general partner for the joint venture and have a combined ownership interest in euro jv fund i and a combined interest in euro jv fund ii 
due to the ownership structure and substantive participating rights of the non host limited partners  including approval over financing  acquisitions and dispositions  and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
as of december   the aggregate size of the euro jv is approximately billion billion 
our investment is approximately million million  of which euro jv fund i is approximately million million and euro jv fund ii is approximately million million 
as general partner  we earn a management fee based on the amount of equity commitments and equity investments 
in  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million of management fees  respectively 
as of december   the partners have funded approximately million  or  of the total equity commitment for euro jv fund i and expect to utilize the remainder for capital expenditures and financing needs 
on june   the euro jv was expanded through the creation of euro jv fund ii  in which each of the partners holds a limited partner interest and we hold the general partner interest 
the euro jv fund ii has a target size of million of new equity and a target investment of approximately billion  after taking into account anticipated debt 
as part of the expansion  we transferred to euro jv fund ii the le m ridien piccadilly at a price of million million  including the assumption of the associated million million mortgage 
in addition to the expansion of the capacity of the euro jv  we have extended its term from to  subject to two one year extensions 
on september   the euro jv fund ii acquired the room pullman bercy  paris  for approximately million  including certain acquisition costs of million and a million mortgage loan 
we contributed million million to the euro jv to finance our portion of the acquisition 
the euro jv fund ii will invest an additional million to renovate the rooms and public space at the hotel 
the euro jv has million of mortgage debt  all of which is non recourse to us and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of our debt 
in  the euro jv negotiated various agreements with the lenders of a significant portion of this debt in order to cure actual or potential covenant defaults  cash sweeps  or non payment defaults that expire throughout the million mortgage secured by a portfolio of six hotels located in spain  italy  poland and the united kingdom and the million mortgage secured by le m ridien piccadilly mature in additionally  the million mortgage secured by the amsterdam hotel matures in  but has two one year extension options  subject to small fees and certain financial covenants 
due to the difficult economic climate in europe  the refinancing options may be limited and we expect that lenders may require more stringent financial covenants  higher rates of interest and lower loan to value ratios on future loans  which would require an equity contribution or debt paydowns with the proceeds from asset sales to reduce the loan principal balance 
we have entered into five foreign currency forward sale contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the euro jv

we have a interest in the asian jv  which is structured as a singapore corporation with reco hotels jv private limited  an affiliate of gic re  to explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout asia and the pacific region 
the initial term of the asian jv is for a period of seven years 
due to the ownership structure and the substantive participating rights of the non host limited partner  including approval over financing  acquisitions and dispositions  and annual operating and capital expenditure budgets  the asian jv is not consolidated in our financial statements 
the commitment period for equity contributions to the asian jv expires in march we do not plan to extend the commitment period beyond the current expiration date  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to invest in asia with our strategic partners 
during  the asian jv invested approximately million of which our share was million of its million commitment to acquire a interest of a joint venture in india with accor sa and interglobe enterprises limited 
this joint venture is developing seven properties  totaling approximately  rooms in three major cities in india  bengaluru  chennai and delhi 
the hotels will be managed by accor under the pullman  ibis and novotel brands 
the first two hotels are expected to be fully opened by march of hospitality properties trust 
we own a leasehold interest in courtyard by marriott properties  which properties were sold to hospitality properties trust hpt and leased back to us in and in conjunction with our conversion to a reit  we entered into subleases with barcel crestline for these properties  as well as residence inn by marriott properties 
in june  hpt sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet net worth covenants  which would have triggered an event of default by us under the leases between us and hpt 
as a result  we terminated the subleases effective july  and we resumed acting as owner under the management agreements 
effective upon termination of the subleases  we recorded the operations of the hotels as opposed to rental income in and on december   we entered into a settlement with barcel crestline  who had guaranteed rent payments to hpt as part of the sublease  related to the termination of the subleases  which resulted in an additional million of income being recorded in to compensate us for a portion of our operating losses subsequent to the sublease termination 
we terminated the master lease with hpt on the residence inn properties effective december  and received million of deferred proceeds related to the initial sale and additional amounts held in the tenant collection account 
on november   we gave notice that we will not extend the lease on the courtyard by marriott properties  which will result in termination of the lease effective december  at the expiration of the lease  hpt is obligated to pay us deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of approximately million  subject to damages arising out of an event of default  if any  under the lease plus additional amounts held in a tenant collection account 
tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  inc  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under these tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements

one of these agreements expires in and the other in 
table of contents guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not recorded on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances  including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent certain restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which currently owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with respect to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote and  in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 
information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements entitled guarantees and contingencies 
contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in this category based on the weighted average interest rate 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and is  therefore  not determinable 
the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
hotels acquired in a business combination 
we record our investments in hotel properties based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we evaluate several factors  including market data for similar assets  expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets 
other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets  capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts  including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
capital lease obligations that are assumed as part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are measured at fair value and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we record the corresponding right to use assets 
classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
in certain situations  a deferred tax liability may be created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date 
any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill 
in very limited circumstances  we may record a bargain purchase gain if the consideration paid is less than the net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
impairment testing 
we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable 
we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property s carrying value over its fair value 
to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
in the absence of other factors  we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements 
we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise  such as an expiring ground lease  or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life 
we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties  including critical infrastructure  which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life 

table of contents we test for impairment in several situations  including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or when other events  trends  contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  both from operations and the eventual disposition  expected useful life and holding period  future required capital expenditures  and fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
while we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows  we reviewed the actual year to date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december  the projected cash flows consider items such as booking pace  occupancy  room rate and property level operating costs 
as a result of our review  we identified six properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations 
to appropriately evaluate if the carrying value of the assets was recoverable  we projected a growth rate such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of over the remaining estimable lives of the properties 
this stabilized growth rate is lower than the projected growth rate for the urban upper upscale properties  which we believe is most representative of our portfolio  over the period from through based on this test  no properties exhibited an impaired value at december  for purposes of this test  if we had assumed a growth rate of after the return to normalized levels of operations  none of the six properties identified above would have required further analysis 
management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions 
during  we recognized impairment expense in the aggregate amount of million on two properties based on a change in their estimated hold periods 
one of the properties was disposed of in other than temporary impairment of an investment 
we review our equity method investments for other than temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment  a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment 
our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties  therefore  we generally will have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment  as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums  ie we use certain inputs  such as available third party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties  to estimate the expected cash flows 
if an equity method investment is impaired  a loss is recorded for the difference between its fair value and its carrying value 
based on this test  no other than temporary impairment was recorded in classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will not occur 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we typically will classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met host inc s board of directors has approved the sale to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 

table of contents to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions  including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of net deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we occasionally will enter into derivative products  including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss  based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts and guarantees 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from host inc s share based payment transactions over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards 
the classification of host inc s restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
awards are classified as liability awards to the extent that settlement features allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services 
during  host inc implemented an employee stock plan for our senior management that covered the period and included the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
these awards vest based on the total shareholder return relative to other reits and lodging companies 
they are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo model  to determine the fair value of host inc s restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host inc s common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of host inc s awards expected to be forfeited 

table of contents restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions 
these awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target  which will be based on the employee s specific management business objectives 
compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable 
if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable  recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome 
these awards are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions 
therefore  the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host inc 
s share price on the reporting date 
stock option awards 
the stock option awards are equity classified awards  as they do not include cash settlement features 
therefore  the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in fair value 
vesting for these awards is based on service conditions 
the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
on january   the compensation policy committee of the board of directors adopted a new compensation plan for senior management the plan  which plan replaces the expired compensation program discussed above 
components of the plan include cash bonuses based on corporate and employee performance measures and grants of restricted stock that vest based on market conditions total stockholder return relative to the nareit equity index  the s p index  and select hospitality companies that serve as relevant industry asset specific competitors for capital and performance conditions employee s specific management business objectives  as well as the issuance of stock options 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the subsidiary 
for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner  we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the assumption of control as the general partner 
limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us  as the general partner  without cause and substantive participating rights  primarily through voting rights 
we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies 
if a subsidiary is a vie  it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies 
we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  we reviewed our subsidiaries and affiliates to determine if i they should be considered vies  and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in their characteristics 
foreign currency translation 
the operations of foreign subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency  which generally is the local currency  and are translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period 
the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates 
the resulting exchange differences are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives  except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as qualifying net investment hedges 

table of contents comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared  and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
of the hotels that we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods hilton melbourne south wharf acquired in april  new york helmsley hotel acquired in march  manchester grand hyatt san diego acquired in march  the portfolio of seven hotels in new zealand acquired in february jw marriott  rio de janeiro acquired in september  w new york  union square acquired in september  westin chicago river north acquired in august  atlanta marriott perimeter center business interruption due to significant renovations  chicago marriott o hare business interruption due to significant renovations  sheraton indianapolis hotel at keystone crossing business interruption due to significant renovations  and san diego marriott marquis marina business interruption due to significant renovations 
the operating results of the le m ridien piccadilly  which was transferred to the euro jv fund ii  and of the three hotels we disposed of in and  as well as the courtyard by marriott properties leased from hpt  are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results relate to our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 
geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international australia  brazil  canada  chile  mexico and new zealand

reporting periods 
for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its us and canadian marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host inc  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott  modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december in order to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott  but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately of total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results typically will differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations

these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp  ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted  as a measure of performance for host inc  and iii comparable hotel operating results  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization 
management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
management uses ebitda to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and  like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share  it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs 
adjusted ebitda historically  management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating host inc and host lp performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income  is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is also a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios 
we adjust ebitda for the following items  which may occur in any period  and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda real estate transactions we exclude the effect of gains and losses  including the amortization of deferred gains  recorded on the disposition or acquisition of assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets 
in addition  material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset value often does not reflect its market value as noted below for ffo 
equity investment adjustments we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation  amortization and interest expense  which are excluded from ebitda 
we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investment 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture 

table of contents consolidated partnership adjustments we deduct the non controlling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non controlling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of non controlling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non controlling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle infrequently  the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we exclude these one time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period 
impairment losses we exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
in addition  we believe that impairment charges are similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense  both of which are also excluded from ebitda 
acquisition costs under gaap  costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred 
we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures  interest expense and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda and adjusted ebitda presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda in millions reconciliation of net loss to ebitda  adjusted ebitda year ended december  net loss interest expense depreciation and amortization income taxes ebitda losses on dispositions acquisition costs non cash impairment charges amortization of deferred gains equity investment adjustments equity in earnings losses of affiliates pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments consolidated partnership adjustments pro rata adjusted ebitda attributable to non controlling partners in other consolidated partnerships adjusted ebitda nareit ffo  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share 
we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period  as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities  divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines 
nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation  amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata ffo of those entities on the same basis 
we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization  impairments and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits  even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
effective with this form k  we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance 
while we are presenting adjusted ffo per diluted share as part of this form k for the first time  management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance  in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share  when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit  
table of contents provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance 
we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items  which may occur in any period  and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt  including the acceleration of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired 
we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock 
we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs 
acquisition costs under gaap  costs associated with completed property acquisitions are expensed in the year incurred 
we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company 
litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business 
we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance 
we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of host inc stockholders

table of contents comparable hotel operating results 
we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store  basis as supplemental information for investors of both host inc and host lp we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs  including expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all information in this section applies to host inc and host lp interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks 
the interest payments on of our debt are fixed in nature this percentage does not include million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments  which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments  discounted at risk adjusted rates 
the senior notes and the debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  our future earnings and cash flows by approximately million in the table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in millions  except percentages expected maturity date thereafter total fair value liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total debt interest rate derivative fixed to variable notional fair value asset liability average pay rate average receive rate variable to fixed notional fair value asset liability average pay rate average receive rate the amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums 
the interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of december  no adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate 
interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
we have designated our floating to fixed interest rate swap derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the swaps 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded to other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying balance sheets 
the hedges were fully effective as of december  
table of contents in connection with the acquisition of the hilton melbourne south wharf on april   we assumed an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of a million million related to its mortgage debt 
in november  as part of the refinancing of this loan  we paid approximately million to settle the original swap and entered into a new interest rate swap with a notional amount of a million million and a maturity date of november  the purpose of the interest rate swap is to hedge against changes in cash flows interest payments attributable to fluctuations in the reuters bbsy 
as a result  we will pay an all in rate of on the notional amount of the swap 
we designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
as a result of the change in fair value of this swap  a million loss was recorded to other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of this swap 
on february   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of nz million million related to the mortgage debt on the seven properties acquired in new zealand on february  we entered into the swap in order to hedge against changes in cash flows interest payments attributable to fluctuations in the month nz bank bill rate 
as a result  we will pay an all in rate of on the notional amount of the swap  which includes the basis point spread over the nz bank bill rate plus an additional basis point commitment fee 
we have designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
as a result of the change in fair value of this derivative  a million loss was recorded to other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of this swap 
interest rate swap derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
we have designated our fixed to floating interest rate swap derivatives as fair value hedges 
we enter into these derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt that occur as a result of changes in market interest rates 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps 
the change in the fair value of the derivative is offset largely by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the month libor rate  which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt 
any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt  which was not significant for the periods presented  is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss 
we have three interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of million related to the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel spa mortgage loan in the amount of million 
as of december  and december   we recorded assets of million and million  respectively  related to the fair value of the swaps
