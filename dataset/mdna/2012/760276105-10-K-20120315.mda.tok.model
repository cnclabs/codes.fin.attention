item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a delaware holding company organized in that offers scheduled passenger services through our wholly owned operating air carrier subsidiaries chautauqua airlines  inc chautauqua  shuttle america corporation shuttle  republic airline inc republic airline and frontier airlines  inc frontier 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the terms the company  we  us  or our  refer to republic airways holdings inc and our subsidiaries 
as of december   our operating subsidiaries offered scheduled passenger service on  flights daily to cities in states  canada  mexico  and costa rica under our frontier operations and through fixed fee code share agreements with amr corp  the parent of american airlines  inc american  continental airlines  inc 
continental  delta air lines  inc delta  united air lines  inc united  and us airways  inc 
us airways collectively referred to as our partners 
currently  we provide our partners with fixed fee regional airline services  operating as americanconnection  continental express  delta connection  united express  or us airways express  including service out of their hubs and focus cities 
fleet composition the following table outlines the type of aircraft our subsidiaries operate and their respective operations within our business units as of december  schedule of operational aircraft operating subsidiaries aircraft size frontier american continental delta united us airways spares number of aircraft chautauqua airlines to shuttle america to republic airline to frontier to total number of operating aircraft during  our operational fleet increased from to the company took delivery of eight a aircraft  two e aircraft  placed into service three a aircraft  sold five a aircraft  four of which have remained in the fleet under sale leaseback agreements  and sold one q the company also returned two e aircraft and three e aircraft to the lessors 
included in the operational fleet there are eleven erj aircraft and one e aircraft that operated as charter service  serve as operational spares  or are temporarily parked 
we continue to look for opportunities to redeploy spare aircraft into our fixed fee business  or outright sell or sublease these aircraft to another airline 
our branded operations consist of all airbus operations at frontier  and includes aircraft operated by chautauqua and republic marketed as frontier 
frontier  which we purchased out of bankruptcy in  is a low fare carrier that has the second largest market share in denver  colorado 
during  we successfully completed an out of court restructuring of the business which will enhance financial performance by more than million in we view frontier as an efficient  low cost producer of narrowbody capacity and believe it is well positioned to compete in denver 
in  we remain focused on further lowering the unit costs of frontier by increasing the average seat density of its aircraft and increasing the percentage of customers who use flyfrontier 
com to purchase tickets on frontier 
we have fixed fee regional jet code share agreements with each of our partners that are subject to our maintaining specified performance levels 
pursuant to these fixed fee agreements  which provide for minimum aircraft utilization at fixed rates  we are authorized to use our partners two character flight designation codes to identify our flights and fares in our partners computer reservation systems  to paint our aircraft in the style of our partners  to use their service marks and to market ourselves as a carrier for our partners 
our fixed fee agreements have historically limited our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
certain of these agreements contain minimum guarantee amounts  penalty provisions for either the early removal of aircraft or agreement termination for activity levels below the minimums 
business strategy fixed fee continue to operate a high quality fleet of aircraft across an efficient network we intend to maintain a modern  high quality fleet of embraer aircraft that meets or exceeds stringent industry operating standards and complies with the terms of our fixed fee regional jet code share agreements 
we believe we have highly efficient flight and maintenance operations due to leveraging large crew and maintenance bases across multiple partners networks 
continue to provide efficient and effective solutions to our partners we have strong  long term relationships with each of our partners and have historically worked together with them to meet their operational and network needs 
historically  we have provided safe  reliable  and cost efficient solutions for our partners 
we remain focused on anticipating and continuing to assist our partners with their business strategies 
take advantage of growth opportunities to operate larger regional jets network carrier consolidation  along with high fuel prices  has limited the economic use of smaller regional jets 
all of our partners  including american  have shown an interest in having more  larger regional jets in their networks 
we believe our existing relationship with our partners and our strong relationship with embraer make us well positioned to take advantage of any growth opportunities 
branded compete effectively by providing our customers with low fares on our low cost  narrowbody aircraft frontier offers a differentiated customer experience with its livetv and bundled fare offerings through its classic and classic plus products  which are available for purchase on frontierairlines 
com 
we believe the restructuring completed in provides frontier with low cost narrowbody aircraft  which allows us to compete effectively in our highly contested markets 
further lower our unit costs cost per available seat mile casm to become an ultra low cost carrier we are focused on our effort to further reduce operating costs at frontier by reducing sales and distribution  marketing and costs associated with our airport operations 
additionally  frontier will add six seats to its a aircraft  which will reduce casm by approximately on the a fleet 
this is a highly cost efficient project that will have a quick payback as we continue to see record load factors on frontier 
take advantage of opportunities resulting from industry consolidation and expand frontier s network outside of denver  colorado frontier continues to reduce its fleet complexity by removing regional aircraft flown by our other subsidiaries 
we remain focused on our network and intend to develop new point to point opportunities outside of denver in markets where we have competitive advantages 
revenue fixed fee service under our code share arrangements with our partners  we receive fixed fees  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior performance 
for the years ended december   and  all of our fixed fee revenue was earned under our fixed fee arrangements 
the number of aircraft we operate and aircraft utilization are the most significant drivers of our revenue  as opposed to the number of passengers we carry or the fare the passengers pay 
passenger service branded passenger service includes passenger ticket revenue on our branded airlines frontier beginning october  midwest beginning august  and mokulele from april to october 
unlike our fixed fee business  the most significant drivers of our revenue are the number of passengers we carry and the fare paid by the passenger 
cargo and other cargo and other revenues is comprised principally of the revenue from the marketing component of the sale of our miles for our co branded credit cards  sublease revenue  licensing revenue from slots leased to other airlines  charter revenue  cargo revenue  interline and ground handling fees 
operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expenses line items follows 
wages and benefits this expense includes not only wages and salaries  but also expenses associated with various employee benefit plans  employee incentives  stock compensation  and payroll taxes 
these expenses will fluctuate based primarily on our level of operations  changes in wage rates for contract  and non contract employees and changes in costs of our benefit plans 
aircraft fuel as of december   the majority of our aircraft fuel for the fixed fee operations is supplied directly by our code share partners  and thus we do not record expense or the related revenue for those gallons of fuel 
beginning in may and june  we did not record fuel expense and the related revenue for the american and delta operations  respectively 
we also did not pay for or record fuel expense and the related revenue for continental or us airways operations 
all fuel costs including into plane fees and taxes are expensed as incurred for our branded operations 
aircraft fuel also includes the realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments on fuel derivatives 
landing fees and airport rents this expense consists of an estimate of fees charged by airports for each aircraft landing and airport rental fees for ticket counter  gate and common space 
under our fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of landing fees 
landing fees and airport rents are expensed as incurred for the branded operations 
aircraft and engine rent this expense consists of the costs of leasing aircraft and spare engines 
the leased aircraft and spare engines are operated under long term operating leases with third parties 
aircraft rent is reduced by the amortization of deferred credits received from the aircraft manufacturer for parts and training 
the credits are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease of the aircraft 
maintenance and repair maintenance and repair expenses include all parts  materials  tooling and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
we have entered into long term maintenance power by the hour service contracts with third party maintenance providers under which we are charged fixed rates for each flight hour accumulated by the majority of our engines and some of the major airframe components 
the effect of such contracts is to reduce the volatility of aircraft maintenance expense over the term of the contract 
all other maintenance is expensed as incurred under the direct expense method of accounting 
insurance and taxes this expense includes the costs of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance  war risk insurance and all other insurance policies  other than employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes personal and real property taxes  including aircraft property taxes 
under our current fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of passenger liability insurance  war risk insurance  aircraft hull insurance and property taxes  subject to certain restrictions 
under our us airways and united fixed fee agreements  we are reimbursed for the actual costs of such items other than aircraft hull insurance  which is reimbursed at agreed upon rates 
depreciation and amortization this expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft  and the amortization of intangible assets with definite lives 
promotion and sales this expense is incurred on our branded operation only and consists of advertising costs  passenger reservation and booking fees  credit card processing fees and commissions 
other impairment charges this expense includes the impairment of aircraft and other equipment  trade names  and other assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of the frontier trade name and airport slots 
we apply a fair value based impairment test to the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
due to the net loss of the branded business the company ensured the fair value was greater than the carrying value by completing an impairment test 
the key assumptions in our impairment test for the frontier tradename include our projected revenues  an estimated weighted average cost of capital  assumed discount rates depending on the asset and a tax rate 
in evaluating the airport slots the company used a market approach by reviewing historical airport slot sales and auction values 
these assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use 
since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  the actual amounts may differ from these estimates 
other intangibles with an indefinite life are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
as of december  there was no impairment charge recorded by the company for indefinite lived intangible assets 
aircraft and other equipment we record impairment losses on aircraft and other equipment used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
factors which could cause impairment include  but are not limited to  a decision to permanently or temporarily remove aircraft and other equipment from operations  significant changes in the estimated useful life  significant changes in projected cash flows  permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values  and changes to the regulatory environment 
for long lived assets held for sale  we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell 
to determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations  we group assets based on aircraft type family the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity  passenger mile yield  fuel costs  labor costs and other relevant factors 
if an impairment occurs  the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
we estimate aircraft fair values using published sources  appraisals and bids received from third parties  as available 
as of december   the company recorded an impairment of million on aircraft  million of an impairment on assets held for sale  and million of an impairment on inventory related to these aircraft 
gain on bargain purchase this represents the amount that the fair values of assets acquired exceeds the assumed liabilities and purchase price from the acquisition of frontier 
other this expense includes the costs of crew training  crew travel  airport  passenger and ground handling related expenses  all hangar and administrative lease expenses  professional fees  and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
additionally  if incurred  this expense will include aircraft return costs  gains and losses on disposal of assets  reorganization costs  severance costs and bad debt expenses

revenue passenger miles are the number of scheduled miles flown by revenue passengers 
available seat miles are the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of scheduled miles those seats are flown 
passenger load factor is revenue passenger miles divided by available seat miles 
total operating costs divided by available seat miles 
costs in all periods exclude impairments and other expenses not attributable to either fixed fee or branded segments 
total operating and interest expenses excluding goodwill impairment and other impairment charges is not a calculation based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered as an alternative to total operating expenses 
cost per available seat mile utilizing this measurement is included as it is a measurement recognized by the investing public relative to the airline industry

liquidity and capital resources compared to as of december   we had total cash of million of which million was unrestricted 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
the company currently anticipates that its unrestricted cash on hand  the cash generated from operations  and other financings will be sufficient to meet its anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under certain of our financing arrangements 
we are required to maintain million of unrestricted cash  maintain certain cash flow  debt service coverage and working capital covenants 
our ability to maintain unrestricted cash levels above this minimum unrestricted cash covenant is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations to fund operating expenses  maintenance deposits for leased aircraft  maturities of debt  capital expenditures and other contractual obligations 
the company currently anticipates that its unrestricted cash on hand  the cash generated from operations  and potential other liquidity initiatives  including but not limited to asset sales  or financings will be sufficient to meet its minimum cash covenants and anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  however  there can be no assurances to that effect 
working capital deficits are customary for airlines since the air traffic liability and a portion of the deferred frequent flyer revenue are classified as current liabilities 
our liquidity depends on the number of passengers who fly in our frontier operations  the fares they pay  the cost of fuel  our operating and capital expenditures  our financing activities  the financial strength of our partners in relation to our fixed fee business  and the amount of cash holdbacks imposed by our credit card processors 
we cannot predict what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  an economic recession  a global credit and liquidity crisis  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million decrease in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the lower net income and timing differences in our working capital in compared to net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the change in proceeds from the sale of aircraft and aircraft slots  offset by the change in aircraft purchased year over year 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in net cash used was primarily due to the company receiving net proceeds of million from a second public offering completed in november of the company made principal repayments of million and retired million of aircraft debt totaling million compared to repayments of million and retirements of million totaling million in the company received proceeds of million in  compared to million from the financing of other equipment during compared to as of december   we had total cash of million of which million was unrestricted

net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the reduction on our credit card holdbacks and the timing of the processing of the holdback settlements 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to timing differences in our working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company did not purchase any aircraft but spent million on engines and million on other maintenance and equipment  which was offset by sold aircraft and other equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in during  the company received net proceeds of million from a second public offering completed in november 
the company made principal repayments of million and retired million of aircraft debt totaling million compared to repayments of million and retirements of million totaling million in the company received proceeds of million from the financing of other equipment during other liquidity initiatives the company s possible financing sources include the issuance of new debt secured by spare parts  sale of aircraft  the sale or monetization of certain assets  the issuance of unsecured debt 
a substantial portion of the company s assets are encumbered  and the company has a limited quantity of assets that could be used as collateral in future financings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining financings at sufficient levels or at acceptable terms 
an inability to obtain necessary additional funding on acceptable terms could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under certain of our financing arrangements 
we are required to maintain a certain level of minimum unrestricted cash and maintain certain cash flow and working capital covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all our covenants 
letters of credit as we enter new markets  increase the amount of space we lease  or add leased aircraft  we are often required to provide the airport authorities and lessors with a letter of credit 
we also provide letters of credit for our workers compensation insurance 
as of december  and  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively  all of which are bond and cash collateralized 
the cash collateralized against the letters of credit are recorded in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
fuel hedging transactions our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk  we periodically purchase call options  enter in fuel swap agreements  or enter into costless collars on various oil derivative commodities 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we choose not to designate these derivatives as hedges  and  as such  realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments are included in aircraft fuel expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a one dollar change in price per barrel of crude oil or the crack spread will increase or decrease our fuel expense by million 
a one cent change in the cost of each gallon of fuel would impact our pre tax income by approximately million per year based on our current fleet and aircraft fuel consumption 
under our fixed fee agreements we are not exposed to changes in fuel prices 
our fixed fee agreements provide for our partners to purchase fuel directly or reimburse us for fuel expense as a pass through cost 
as of december   we did not have a hedge position 
we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and may take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available 
aircraft leases and other off balance sheet arrangements we have significant obligations for aircraft and engines that are classified as operating leases and  therefore  are not reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet 
aircraft leases expire between and as of december   our total mandatory payments under operating leases for aircraft aggregated approximately billion and total minimum annual aircraft rental payments for the next months under all non cancelable operating leases is approximately million 
other non cancelable operating leases consist of engines  terminal space  operating facilities  office space and office equipment 
the leases expire through as of december   our total mandatory payments under other non cancelable operating leases aggregated approximately million 
total minimum annual other rental payments for the next months are approximately million 
commitments and obligations as of december   the company had firm orders to purchase cs aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in early and continuing through  and sixty airbus neo aircraft and twenty airbus neo aircraft that have scheduled delivery dates beginning in early  and continuing through the company also has a commitment to acquire eight spare aircraft engines and expects to take delivery of two engines in  two engines in  three engines in and one engine beyond we expect to fund future capital and funding commitments through internally generated funds  third party aircraft financings  and debt and other financings 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  include the following in millions payments due by period beyond total long term debt including interest operating leases tax liability for uncertain tax positions debt or lease financed aircraft purchase obligations engines under firm orders total contractual cash obligations the company has maintenance agreements for engines  auxiliary power units apu and other airframe components for our e and e aircraft 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the engines  apus  avionics  wheels and brakes  and select rotable parts through october  june  december  june  and september  respectively 
for our e aircraft  we have agreements to maintain the avionics  wheels and brakes  apus  engines  emergency slides  and select rotable parts through december  february  july  december  may  and january  respectively 
under these agreements  we are charged for covered services based on a fixed rate for each flight hour or flight cycle accumulated by the engines or airframes in our service during each month 
the rates are subject to annual revisions  generally based on certain bureau of labor statistics labor and material indices 
we believe these agreements  coupled with our ongoing maintenance program  reduce the likelihood of unexpected levels of engine  apu  avionics  wheels and brakes  emergency slides  and select rotable parts maintenance expense during their term 
certain of these agreements contain minimum guarantee amounts  penalty provisions for either the early removal of aircraft or agreement termination for activity levels below the minimums 
while the company does not have long term maintenance agreements for airbus except for wheels and brakes through december and q fleets  it has made significant deposits with the aircraft lessors for future maintenance events which will reduce future cash requirements 
as of december  and  we had maintenance deposits of million and million  respectively 
total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  million  and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant tax payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed fee service under our fixed fee arrangements with our partners  the company receives fixed fees for our capacity purchase agreements  as well as reimbursement of specified pass through costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior service 
these revenues are recognized in the period the service is provided  and we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
the reimbursement of specified costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger liability and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes  fuel  landing fees and catering 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed for reimbursement 
under the company s code share agreements  the company is reimbursed an amount per aircraft designed to compensate the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
the company has concluded that a component of its fixed fee service revenues under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during  and was million  million  and million  respectively  and has been included in fixed fee service revenues in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition passenger service passenger service revenues are recognized when the transportation is provided or after the tickets expire which is either immediately upon the scheduled departure of the flight or up to thirteen months after the date of issuance depending on the type of ticket purchased  and are net of excise taxes  passenger facility charges and security fees 
passenger service revenues that have been deferred are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as air traffic liability 
included in passenger service revenue are change fees imposed on passengers for making schedule changes to non refundable tickets 
change fees are recognized as revenue at the time the change is made for the passenger as these fees are a separate transaction that occur subsequent to the date of the original ticket sale 
the company is required to charge certain taxes and fees on passenger tickets 
these taxes and fees include us federal transportation taxes  federal security charges  airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes 
these taxes and fees are legal assessments on the customer  for which the company has an obligation to act as a collection agent 
because the company is not entitled to retain these taxes and fees  such amounts are not included in passenger service revenue 
the company records a liability when the amounts are collected and reduces the liability when payments are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier 
frequent flyer programs the company has a frequent flyer program that offers incentives to travel on its airlines and promotes customer loyalty 
the program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on frontier and through participating companies  such as credit card companies  hotels  and car rental agencies 
the company also sells mileage credits to nonairline businesses 
the mileage credits may be redeemed for free air travel on frontier  as well as hotels  rental cars  and other awards 
mileage credits earned on frontier the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated selling price of the air transportation for mileage credits awarded and recognizes that amount as passenger service revenue when the mileage credit is redeemed and the transportation is provided 
the estimated selling price of the air transportation component is determined utilizing the deferred revenue method as further described below 
the initial revenue deferral is presented as deferred frequent flyer revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
when recognized  the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as passenger service revenue in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company s accounting policy for its frequent flyer program is the deferred revenue method 
the deferred revenue method is to record the frequent flyer obligation by allocating an estimated selling price to each outstanding mile based on projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed 
such value is estimated assuming redemptions on our airline  and other redemption choices and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service and redemption choices 
the estimated selling price of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required 
for example  management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on the company s airline versus on other redemption choices 
since the estimated selling price of miles redeemed on frontier and other redemption choices can vary greatly  this assumption can materially affect the estimated selling price from period to period 
management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of frontier customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles  each of which can have materially different estimated values 
such choices include different classes of service and award levels 
customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes  which occur from time to time  introducing new award choices or making material changes to the terms of existing award choices 
management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior  which requires the use of significant judgment 
management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates  but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior patterns  which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in historical changes to deferred frequent flyer revenue balances and to recognized revenue 
the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles  regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award 
eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to redeem awards  or their account will deactivate after a period of inactivity  in which case the company will recognize the related revenue when the miles expire as passenger service revenue 
current and future changes to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred frequent flyer revenue balance as well as recognized revenue from the program 
mileage credits sold the company has agreements with its co branded credit card partner that require its partner to purchase miles as they are awarded to the co branded partner cardholders 
the company continues to use the residual method of allocation for this multiple element arrangement as the agreement has not been materially modified since january   the adoption date of accounting standards update the air transportation element for the awarded miles is included in deferred frequent flyer revenue at the estimated fair value of the air transportation element and the residual marketing element is recorded as other revenue when the miles are awarded 
the deferred frequent flyer revenue is subsequently recognized as other revenue when the transportation is provided 
the company also sells mileage credits in its frequent flyer programs to third parties 
for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   the estimated selling price of the travel portion of the sale is recognized as part of deferred frequent flyer revenue 
the estimated selling price of the marketing component  is recognized as other revenue in the month the miles are sold 
for revenue arrangements that have not been materially modified since january   the travel portion of the sale is recognized as part of the deferred frequent flyer revenue liability 
the remaining portion  referred to as the marketing component  is recognized as other revenue in the month the miles are sold 
aircraft leases the company has aircraft that are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is responsible for all other maintenance costs of its aircraft and must meet specified return conditions upon lease expiration for both the airframes and engines 
impairments to long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and residual values for our definite lived assets 
as a result of the company s impairment test for the indefinite lived other intangible assets and aircraft and other equipment the company recorded an impairment for aircraft and other equipment 
see note in item impairments to goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the following table reflects the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  in millions gross carrying amount impairment net balance at january  impairment during midwest acquisistion during balance at december   and during and prior to the acquisition of midwest in july  the company had one reporting unit and all of the goodwill of million was assigned to that unit 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company makes a determination of the fair value of its business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon projections of future revenues  expenses  and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the regional airline industry 
an impairment loss will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information included in the company s determination of fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  market valuation comparisons to similar airlines  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
during the first quarter of  the company performed an interim test of its goodwill 
factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential triggering event included record high fuel prices  a softening us economy and the differences between market capitalization of our stock as compared to the book value of equity 
as a result of the testing  the company determined that the goodwill was completely impaired and recorded an impairment charge during the first quarter of to write off the full value of goodwill 
the company s acquisition of midwest resulted in approximately million of goodwill which was assigned to the company s branded operations reporting unit 
as of december   the company performed its annual assessment of the recoverability of its goodwill 
the branded operations reporting unit book value of invested capital exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
the company determined the fair value of the branded invested capital utilizing the income  market  and cost approach 
the company s fair value calculations for goodwill are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
as a result of failing step one  the company was required to perform step two of the asc topic goodwill impairment testing methodology 
in step two of the impairment testing  the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the company utilized its recent valuations of tangible and intangible assets related to the branded operations reporting unit to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities 
as a result of the step two testing  the company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a full impairment charge on december   the company s annual assessment date 
factors attributable to the impairment of goodwill consisted of the following increased competition in our key markets including denver and milwaukee  current economic conditions and forecasts within the united states  volatility of fuel prices  and other related factors 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
the company charges expenses as incurred under the direct expense method 
engines and certain airframe component overhaul and repair costs are subject to power by the hour contracts with external vendors and are expensed as the aircraft are flown 
as a result of the acquisition of frontier  the company acquired deposits related to leased aircraft at frontier 
the company has determined that it is probable that substantially all maintenance deposits will be refunded through qualifying maintenance activities  except for deposits related to certain aircraft that are expected to be returned to the lessor in deposits are reimbursed based on the specific event for each specified deposit  as determined by the lease 
the projected ultimate cost was based on actual historical repair invoices as well as estimates 
this analysis was performed by lease and by deposit type 
as of december   the company has evaluated its carrying amount of maintenance deposits and believes the deposits are recoverable when the future maintenance event occurs and the company is reimbursed 
the company will continue to evaluate whether it is probable the deposits will be returned to reimburse the costs of the maintenance activities incurred 
as the company makes future payments  if the deposits are less than probable of being returned  they will be recognized as additional expense at that time 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
certain of our nols generated prior to july and acquired from midwest and frontier are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of deferred tax asset  and other carry forwards becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized

pertaining to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance will affect accounting and reporting for companies that enter into multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with their customers when those arrangements are within the scope of accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance was effective for the company prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted this accounting standard on january  and the impact to the consolidated financial statements was not material 
in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc 
this amendment requires disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this amendment is effective for periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company has adopted this amendment on january  by adding additional disclosures  except for the additional recurring level requirements 
the company did not have any recurring level activity for the year ended december in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board on fair value measurements 
the guidance clarifies how a principal market is determined  addresses the fair value measurement of instruments with offsetting market or counterparty credit risks  addresses the concept of valuation premise and highest and best use  extends the prohibition on blockage factors to all three levels of the fair value hierarchy  and requires additional disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have been and are subject to market risks  including commodity price risk such as  to a limited extent  aircraft fuel prices and interest rate risk 
interest rates our earnings can be affected by changes in interest rates due to the amount of cash and securities held and variable rate debt 
at december  and  approximately million and million of our outstanding debt was at variable interest rates  respectively 
a one hundred basis point change in the libor rate would have increased or decreased interest expense by million and million for and we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through the manufacturer  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements our reimbursement rates may not be adjusted higher or lower to reflect any changes in our aircraft rental rates 
aircraft fuel price risk our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices 
in an effort to manage our exposure to this risk  we periodically purchase call options  enter into fuel swap agreements  or enter into costless collars on various oil derivative commodities 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we choose not to designate these derivatives as hedges  and  as such  realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments are included in aircraft fuel expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
a one dollar change in price per barrel of crude oil will increase or decrease our fuel expense by million 
a one cent change in the cost of each gallon of fuel would impact our pre tax income by approximately million per year based on our current fleet and aircraft fuel consumption 
under our fixed fee agreements we are not exposed to changes in fuel prices 
our fixed fee agreements provide for our partners to purchase fuel directly or reimburse us for fuel expense as a pass through cost 
as of december   we did not have a hedge position on any of its anticipated volume of fuel 
we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available
