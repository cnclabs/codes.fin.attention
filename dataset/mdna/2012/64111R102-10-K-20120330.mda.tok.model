we developed and launched in the fourth quarter of a beta test version of the yapik mobile application on android and ios platforms and we are developing and preparing to launch the website legalguru 
com in the second quarter of see development of business in part i  item of this report 
we believe that our technology platforms and development expertise will enable us to enhance the digital distribution of content in a variety of industries 
accordingly  we are exploring the possibility of acquiring other internet portal properties and companies with similar goals of connecting people in various vertical markets  such as the medical  educational and sports markets 
from time to time  we may be engaged in various discussions to acquire businesses or formulate joint venture or other arrangements 
our policy is not to disclose discussions or potential transactions until definitive agreements have been executed 
where appropriate  acquisitions will be financed with our equity securities  which may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
on november   we changed our fiscal year end from march to december accordingly  our first full month fiscal year ran from january  through december  the nine month period from april  through december  is presented as comparative financial information 
accordingly  reflects twelve months of operations as an online media company and fiscal reflects the nine month transition period from april through december  when we had no significant operations until we acquired openfilm  llc on december  management recognizes that we must raise capital sufficient to fund our business activities until such time as we can generate sufficient revenues and net cash flows in amounts necessary to enable us to continue operations  of which there can be no assurance 
see going concern and liquidity and capital resources below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
in applying estimates  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by outside sources  trade journals and other sources  as appropriate 
deferred taxes 
estimates of deferred income taxes and items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and the probability of the realization 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in tax law  operating results that vary from budget or the review of our tax returns by the irs 
valuation of stock based compensation 
stock based compensation has been provided by the company in order to preserve the cash flow necessary to grow our business 
in addition  we entered into the subscription agreement described above to strengthen our available sources of capital 
we believe the estimate of stock based compensation is a critical accounting estimate that significantly affects our results of operations 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with our board of directors and the board of directors has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this report 
capitalized website costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs 
generally  costs for developing website application and infrastructure  creating the initial graphics of the website  and adding upgrades and enhancements are capitalized whereas costs for planning  adding content  and operating the website are expensed as incurred 
net capitalized website costs are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is provided for on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the website 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment exists 
revenue 
we recognize revenue when the persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
we recognize revenue on a gross basis and publisher expenses that are directly related to a revenue generating event are recorded as a component of cost of revenue

as a result of our history of recurring losses and our accumulated deficit and stockholders deficiency  the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm as of december  contains a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
management recognizes that we must raise capital sufficient to fund business activities until such time as we can generate sufficient revenues and net cash flows in amounts necessary to enable us to continue contemplated operations  of which there can be no assurance 
we have historically been dependent upon tgr capital  llc  enerfund  llc or mike zoi as a result of his controlling interest in tgr capital and enerfund to fund our operations and we are exploring additional sources of financing in order to meet our financial requirements 
as of the date this report was filed with the commission  management expects that our cash flows from operations and proceeds received from the subscription agreements of felix vulis and kenges rakishev described above will be sufficient to meet our financial requirements through the end of may management currently believes that we will require an additional  in financing to continue operations as currently conducted and to pay for anticipated capital expenditures over the next months 
additional funds may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues or cash flows from operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets 
any equity financing or debt financing that requires the issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted  which dilution may be substantial 
also  any additional equity securities issued may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if such financings are not available when required or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to implement our business plans or take advantage of business opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations and may ultimately require us to suspend or cease operations 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  fair value measurement asu 
the primary focus of asu is the convergence of accounting requirements for fair value measurements and related financial statement disclosures under us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
while asu does not significantly change existing guidance for measuring fair value  it does require additional disclosures about fair value measurements and changes the wording of certain requirements in the guidance to achieve consistency with ifrs 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and is required to be applied prospectively 
the company does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption in in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this guidance requires companies to present the components of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either method  amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income oci to net income for each reporting period must be displayed as components of both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements 
the guidance does not change the items that are reported in oci 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  other than presentational changes  the company does not anticipate a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption in in september  the fasb issued amendments to its accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
this permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment test performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the company did not early adopt this guidance and does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption in item a
