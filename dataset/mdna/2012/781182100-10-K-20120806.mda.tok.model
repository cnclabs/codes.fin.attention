we also operate truffles restaurants pursuant to a license agreement and franchise the ruby tuesday  lime fresh  and wok hay concepts in selected domestic and international markets 
our mission is to be the best in the bar grill segment of casual dining by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
while we are in the bar grill sector because of our varied menu  it is our goal to operate at the higher end of casual dining in terms of the quality of our food and service 
as of june   we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants located in states and the district of columbia 
our traditional franchisees operated domestic and international ruby tuesday restaurants in states  guam  and foreign countries 
the company owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the southeast  northeast  mid atlantic  and midwest regions of the united states 
we consider these regions to be our core markets 
as of june   there were company owned and operated lime fresh restaurants  marlin ray s restaurants  two truffles restaurants  and one wok hay restaurant 
in addition  there were four lime fresh restaurants operated by domestic franchisees as of june  references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor s understanding of the franchise system  which includes our traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  employees  advertising and promotion  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do 
while we are in the bar and grill sector because of our varied menu  we operate at the higher end of casual dining in terms of the quality of our food and service 
our mission  since we repositioned our brand in  is to be the best in the bar and grill segment of casual dining by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
we believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business  strengthen our competitive position  enhance our profitability  and create value through the execution of the following strategies enhance sales and margins of our core brand in order to entice guests to see the new ruby tuesday  increase frequency of visits  drive same restaurant sales growth and enhance brand visibility  we are increasing our television marketing spend 
our marketing strategy for the last several fiscal years has focused mainly on print promotions  digital media and local marketing programs  with minimal spend on television 
in fiscal we began testing television marketing in certain markets with approximately of our restaurants covered by television advertising in the third quarter and approximately to of our restaurants covered in our fourth quarter through leveraging a mixture of network and national cable at varying media weights 
based on favorable trends exhibited by our test markets in fiscal  at the start of fiscal we deployed a television marketing program which will cover the entire system of restaurants for a portion of each quarter with the remaining portion of the quarter to be supplemented by high end direct mail and other promotions 
our creative messaging will support a pure value and quality advertisement  in addition to potential limited time offers throughout the year 
we believe that having television advertising expense levels more in line with our peers in tandem with a more balanced approach on our promotional strategies will position us for improvements in same restaurant sales in the future through driving repeat and new trial of our brand 
in order to fund the incremental television advertising efforts at no dilution to the overall profitability or cash flow of the company  we have engaged a leading enterprise improvement consulting firm to assist us in identifying potential savings opportunities in a number of key areas including procurement  occupancy  and maintenance costs 
the majority of these cost savings will be reinvested into our television marketing programs 
focus on low risk  low capital intensive  high return growth in an effort to be prudent with our capital  we have a strategy to grow our company in a low risk  low capital intensive and high return manner  with a focus on the fast casual segment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired the lime fresh concept for million 
we had previously opened lime fresh restaurants under a licensing agreement 
however  after over a year of experience with the brand and better understanding its positioning in the high quality fast casual segment  we decided that we could more quickly grow the concept if we owned it 
the fast casual segment of our industry is a proven and growing segment where demand exceeds supply  and we believe opening smaller  inline locations under the lime fresh brand is a good potential growth option for us 
we also believe lime fresh can create good long term value and strong cash flow with relatively low risk 
we opened six company owned lime fresh restaurants during fiscal and plan to open to company owned lime fresh restaurants during fiscal over time  we also plan on opening company owned  smaller inline type ruby tuesday restaurants as well 
increase returns through new concept conversions another part of our long term plan is to get more out of existing restaurants by generating higher average restaurant volumes and thus more profit and cash flow with minimal capital investment 
therefore  we have been converting certain underperforming ruby tuesday concept restaurants into our internally developed seafood concept  marlin ray s  which is a uniquely differentiated  high value casual dining brand 
we converted ten company owned ruby tuesday restaurants to the marlin ray s concept during fiscal and expect to convert five to seven during fiscal we believe the low capital requirement and potential increased revenue and ebitda from these conversions  in addition to the revenue increases we are seeing at neighboring ruby tuesday locations  can potentially provide attractive cash on cash returns and strong cash flow 
strengthen our balance sheet to facilitate growth and value creation during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we further strengthened our balance sheet and created additional financial flexibility by issuing million in a senior unsecured notes offering with an eight year maturity 
as a result of the transaction  we were able to pay off all of our outstanding debt with the exception of some of our mortgage debt from the franchise partnership acquisitions  reduce our revolver commitment size from million to million  obtain attractive interest rates  extend the maturity date of the majority of our debt for up to eight years  and build excess cash which we will reinvest in the future 
we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and have a sufficient amount of liquidity 
our near term capital expenditure requirements will consist of converting approximately five to seven ruby tuesday concept restaurants to the marlin ray s concept  opening one newly constructed marlin ray s restaurant  and opening approximately to smaller  inline lime fresh restaurants during fiscal our strong balance sheet is supported by a high quality portfolio of owned real estate  and during fiscal we commenced on a sale leaseback program on a portion of our properties in order to create greater financial flexibility and generate additional liquidity for debt reduction or reinvestment 
we are targeting to raise approximately million of gross proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  of which million was raised during fiscal and utilized for debt reduction 
we anticipate the remaining sale leaseback transactions to be completed over the next one to two quarters and plan to utilize the proceeds for further debt reduction or other corporate purposes 
see further discussion in the investing activities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
we generated million of free cash flow during fiscal  which was used to pay down debt and repurchase stock 
we estimate we will generate approximately to million of free cash flow during fiscal included in these estimates is anticipated capital spending of approximately to million 
our objective over the next several years is to continue to reduce outstanding debt levels in order to reduce our leverage  focus on new lime fresh restaurant development and marlin ray s conversions  and potentially repurchase outstanding shares under our share repurchase program 
our success in the four key long range plan initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our return on assets and return on equity  and to create additional shareholder value 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal was a week year 
all other years discussed throughout this md a section contained weeks 
in fiscal  the rd week added million to restaurant sales and operating revenue and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statement of operations 
we remind you that  in order to best obtain an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our same restaurant sales for company owned restaurants decreased in fiscal and our diluted loss per share was in fiscal compared to diluted earnings per share of in fiscal throughout this md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail  provide insight for fiscal years and  as well as discuss known events  uncertainties  and trends

our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended june  increased to  million compared to the prior year 
the increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees in fiscal coupled with the revenue associated with the rd week in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in ruby tuesday concept same restaurant sales 
included in our restaurant sales and operating revenue for fiscal is million of restaurant sales for restaurants acquired from our franchisees during fiscal these same restaurants generated sales of million in fiscal from the various dates of acquisition through may  the decrease in same restaurant sales is attributable to lower guest counts  which was partially offset by an increase in average net check compared with the prior year 
the increase in average net check was a result of menu price increases and a shift in menu mix 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended may  increased to  million compared to fiscal the increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees in fiscal and a increase in same restaurant sales 
included in our restaurant sales and operating revenue for fiscal is million of restaurant sales for restaurants we acquired from our franchisees during fiscal the increase in same restaurant sales for fiscal is attributable to higher average net check in fiscal due to a shift in our value positioning and print incentive strategy since fiscal and a change in menu mix from the rollout of our menu in august of fiscal  offset by an overall decrease in guest traffic compared to fiscal franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties up to of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue decreased to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease is due to a million decline in royalties from our traditional domestic franchisees due in part to a decline in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants during fiscal and a million reduction in royalties from our franchise partnerships due to the acquisition of restaurants from our franchise partnerships during fiscal the increase in fiscal is due to an increase in royalties from our traditional domestic franchisees as we recognized royalty fees due from a traditional domestic franchisee who previously had been deferring payment in fiscal  coupled with an increase in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants of for the year ended may  under our accounting policy  we do not recognize franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has borrowed directly from us 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
accordingly  we have deferred recognition of a portion of franchise revenue from certain franchises 
unearned income for franchise fees was insignificant and million as of june  and may   respectively  which are included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in unearned income is primarily attributable to the write off of unearned fees associated with a traditional domestic franchisee that filed bankruptcy in june total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday restaurants 
the and decreases in franchise restaurant sales for fiscal and  respectively  are primarily due to the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees during fiscal operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  for the periods indicated 
all information is derived from our consolidated financial statements located in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
restaurant sales and operating revenue franchise revenue total revenue operating costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation as a percentage of total revenue selling  general  and administrative  net of support service fees closures and impairments goodwill impairment interest expense  net total operating costs and expenses loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income pre tax loss income for fiscal  pre tax loss was million or of total revenue  as compared to pre tax profit of million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in same restaurant sales of at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  a goodwill impairment charge of million  higher closures and impairments million and interest expense million  and increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  and selling  general  and administrative  net 
these higher costs were partially offset by decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  of cost of merchandise and depreciation 
pre tax income decreased million from fiscal to million for the year ended may  the lower pre tax income was due to increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  selling  general  and administrative  net  and closures and impairments  and higher equity in losses from unconsolidated equity method franchises 
these higher costs were partially offset by million in pre tax income on the restaurants acquired from franchisees during fiscal  an increase in same restaurant sales of at company owned restaurants  and decreases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of depreciation  and interest expense  net 
in the paragraphs that follow  we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre tax loss income for years ended june  and may  as compared to the comparable prior year 
because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate  we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  as well as the absolute dollar change  to the comparable prior year 
fiscal year franchise restaurant acquisitions the table below shows operating results from the dates of acquisition which occurred between august  and may  for the years ended june  and may  for the restaurants that were acquired from franchisees in fiscal in thousands unaudited june  may  total revenue cost of merchandise payroll and related costs other restaurant operating costs depreciation selling  general  and administrative  net income before income taxes cost of merchandise cost of merchandise increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise decreased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  cost of merchandise decreased million 
the absolute dollar decrease in cost of merchandise not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions is primarily a result of a decrease in same restaurant sales during fiscal of coupled with cost savings negotiated with our primary food distributor during the year 
additionally  during the second half of fiscal we renegotiated contracts and changed the product specifications on several items with certain vendors which resulted in cost savings on many products 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease in cost of merchandise for the year ended june  is due primarily to cost savings negotiated with our primary food distributor and various other vendors since the prior year as discussed above 
cost of merchandise increased million from fiscal to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  cost of merchandise increased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  cost of merchandise decreased million 
for the year ended may   the absolute dollar change not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions was due to lower food costs at our other restaurants as a result of a decrease in guest counts during fiscal contributing to the lower guest counts during fiscal was inclement winter weather in many of our core markets during the third quarter and lower guest counts in our first and fourth quarters as a result of a shift in our value promotion strategy by changing the buy one get one free promotion offered during the first quarter of the prior year to a buy one get one free up to or a off on our specialties  fork tender ribs  and handcrafted steaks and reducing the number of system wide freestanding insert coupons offered during the current versus the prior year 
partially offsetting the decrease in cost of sales due to guest counts were the addition of garlic cheese biscuits  produce price increases  and wine costs as discussed below 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase in cost of merchandise for the year ended may  was due to primarily to the rollout of garlic cheese biscuits at all of our restaurants  price increases during the second half of fiscal on several produce items due to the winter freeze that impacted crops in mexico  and increased wine cost due in part to higher sales of our premium wines during fiscal payroll and related costs payroll and related costs increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs increased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased million 
for the year ended june   the decrease in absolute dollars not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions is primarily a result of new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants and lowered staffing levels attributable to reduced guest traffic from the same periods of the prior year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended june  is due to higher management labor as a result of merit increases during the current year  minimum wage increases in several states since the prior year  and higher futa tax owed following the failure of several states to repay the federal government for unemployment insurance loans  coupled with the impact on net sales of increased value focused promotional activity and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes 
payroll and related costs increased million from fiscal to million for the year ended may  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs increased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased million 
for the year ended may   the decrease in absolute dollars not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions was insignificant 
as a percentage of restaurants sales and operating revenue  the increase in payroll and related costs was due to higher hourly labor which resulted from additional hours scheduled for saturday nights  additional bartender labor on monday nights during football season  increased labor associated with the rollout of our bread program  and unfavorable state unemployment costs due to rate increases in states 
other restaurant operating costs other restaurant operating costs increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  other restaurant operating costs increased from to

these were partially offset by increased guaranty expense relating primarily to debt defaults by certain franchisees we chose not to acquire and which now have ceased operations  higher repairs expense due to impinger oven maintenance  increased costs associated with the inclement winter weather during fiscal  and an overall increase in building repairs as we incurred costs to maintain the look of our restaurants from the reimaging completed in fiscal other offsets include upgrading our cable packages during fiscal to offer a greater variety of sports programming in our bar area of certain restaurants  higher credit card expense due in part to increases in processing fees charged by our credit card vendors coupled with accrued income in fiscal relating to the net proceeds from the visa mastercard antitrust class action litigation of which we were a class member

selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses  net increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  selling  general and administrative  net increased million 
the increase for the year ended june  is due to higher advertising costs million  primarily as a result of increased television advertising  coupled with higher general and administrative expense million 
the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal was due to higher management labor million as a result of executive severance payments and accruals  consulting fees million  primarily relating to cost control projects  lower franchise support service fee income million as a result of franchise partnership acquisitions during fiscal  and higher support center bonus expense million 
these were partially offset by lower share based compensation expense million as a result of the inclusion within a portion of the fiscal share based compensation award of performance conditions for which we expect less than full achievement  compared to the prior year share based compensation award which contained only service conditions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  net of support service fee income  increased million from fiscal to million for the year ended may  excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  selling  general and administrative  net of support service fee income increased million 
the increase for fiscal was primarily due to higher advertising costs million as a result of testing a marketing initiative by inserting coupons in certain national magazines  an increase in internet advertising due to the implementation of digital media since fiscal  and higher advertising agency fees and television advertising during fiscal also contributing to the increase were higher management labor and training payroll million due to an increase  since fiscal  in team members  travel and related costs million as a result of an increase in training sessions during fiscal  share based compensation expense million  and higher consulting fees million  primarily relating to cost savings initiatives

closures and impairments closures and impairments increased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to higher restaurant impairment charges million due to management s decision in the third quarter of fiscal to close to restaurants  of which were closed in our fourth quarter 
of the million in restaurant impairment charges recorded during fiscal  million is a result of impairments related to the restaurant closures 
the remaining increase is due to higher closed restaurant lease reserve expense million and other closing expense million  which were partially offset by an increase in gains during the current year on the sale of surplus properties million 
closures and impairments increased million to million for the year ended may   as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher restaurant impairment charges million and losses on the sale of surplus properties during fiscal compared to gains on the sale of surplus properties in fiscal million  which were partially offset by reductions in closed restaurant lease reserve expense million  other closing costs million  and dead site costs million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal   and goodwill impairment we concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal that it was likely our goodwill  other than that recently added with the lime fresh acquisition  was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge during fiscal of million 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our fiscal goodwill impairment charge and our current goodwill 
equity in losses of unconsolidated franchises our equity in the losses of unconsolidated franchises was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the change is attributable to increased losses from investments in two of our owned franchise partnerships  both of which were acquired during fiscal included in these increased losses was million  which represents our share of an impairment loss recorded on a closed franchise restaurant 
offsetting this were decreased losses or increased earnings from investments in four of our owned franchise partnerships  all of which were acquired during fiscal as of may   we had acquired all of our owned franchise partnerships 
net interest expense net interest expense increased million to million for the year ended june   primarily due to higher interest expense on our mortgage obligations outstanding due to the acquisition of restaurants from the franchise partnerships in fiscal and prepayment premiums on the payoff during fiscal of the series b senior notes and certain mortgage obligations 
net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended may   primarily due to lower average debt outstanding on our revolving credit agreement and the payoff of the private placement series a senior notes in fiscal benefit provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for the prior year 
the change in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the fact that the company reported an operating loss in fiscal and income in fiscal fica tip credits and work opportunity tax credits generated in fiscal increased the effective tax rate above the statutory rate 
offsetting this was the write off of goodwill  million of which we estimated will be nondeductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to an increase in the benefit of fica tip and work opportunity tax credits during fiscal as compared to fiscal  coupled with the exclusion for tax purposes of net gains from franchise acquisitions in fiscal these benefits were partially offset by the recognition of a deferred tax valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and short term investments operating activities our cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees 
substantially all of the  million   million  and  million of restaurant sales and operating revenue disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and  respectively  was received in cash either at the point of sale or within two to four days when our guests paid with debit or credit cards 
our primary uses of cash for operating activities are food and beverage purchases  payroll and benefit costs  restaurant operating costs  general and administrative expenses  and marketing  a significant portion of which are incurred and paid in the same period 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal decreased million from the prior year to million 
the decrease is due to lower ebitda as a result of a decrease in same restaurant sales at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants and higher cash paid for interest million as a result of increased interest on our mortgage obligations outstanding due to the acquisition of restaurants from the franchise partnerships in fiscal and prepayment premiums on the payoff during the current year of the series b senior notes and certain mortgage obligations 
these were partially offset by a reduction in cash paid for income taxes million and reduced amounts spent to acquire inventory 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal decreased million from fiscal to million 
the decrease was due primarily to an increase in cash paid for income taxes of million  a substantial portion of which is due to a fiscal federal refund related to a tax accounting method change as permitted by the internal revenue service relating to the expensing of certain repairs 
our working capital deficiency and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we typically carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because cash a current asset generated from operating activities is reinvested in capital expenditures a long term asset  stock repurchases thereby reducing equity or debt reduction a long term liability and receivable and inventory levels are generally not significant 
included within the current assets section of our consolidated balance sheet at june  is cash and short term investments of million  which primarily consists of excess cash raised in connection with our high yield bond offering during the fourth quarter of fiscal investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new or converted restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts

as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of lime fresh  including the assets of seven lime fresh concept restaurants  the royalty stream from five lime fresh concept franchised restaurants one of which was not yet open  and the lime fresh brand s intellectual property for million 
as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire the remaining member or limited partnership interests of franchise partnerships which collectively operated restaurants  one additional restaurant from a twelfth franchise partnership  and three restaurants from a traditional domestic franchisee 
during the year ended june   we completed sale leaseback transactions of the land and building for ten company owned ruby tuesday concept restaurants for gross cash proceeds of million  exclusive of transaction costs of approximately million 
equipment was not included 
the net proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions were used to pay down certain of our mortgage loan obligations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions and similar transactions which have closed subsequent to june  capital expenditures for fiscal are budgeted to be to million based on our planned improvements for existing restaurants and our expectation that we will open approximately to lime fresh restaurants  convert approximately five to seven ruby tuesday concept restaurants to the marlin ray s concept  and open one newly constructed marlin ray s restaurant in fiscal we intend to fund our investing activities with cash currently on hand  cash provided by operations  or borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
financing activities historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
our current borrowings and credit facilities are described below 
on may   we entered into an indenture the indenture among the company  certain subsidiaries of the company as guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association as trustee  governing the company s million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at a discount of million  which is being amortized using the effective interest method over the eight year term of the notes 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
they rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are effectively subordinated to all of our secured debt  including borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes

these loans  which mature between july and november  have balances which range from negligible to million and interest rates of to 
many of the properties acquired from franchisees collateralize the loans outstanding 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of rti common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
as of june   the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased was million 
we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock during fiscal and additionally  there were no dividends paid during fiscal   or significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a senior unsecured notes a interest b operating leases c purchase obligations d pension obligations e total f a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt 
b amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed rate debt instruments 
interest payments on our variable rate notes payable with balances of million  as of june  have been excluded from the amounts shown above  primarily because the balances outstanding can fluctuate monthly 
additionally  the amounts shown above include interest payments on the senior notes at the current interest rate of c this amount includes operating leases totaling million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected

subsequent to that date piccadilly cafeterias  inc 
piccadilly acquired mfc and compass group compass acquired mhc 
as agreed upon at the time of the distribution  we have been contingently liable for payments to mfc and mhc employees retiring under mfc s and mhc s versions of the management retirement plan and the executive supplemental pension plan the two non qualified defined benefit plans for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of march we estimated our divestiture guarantees at june  to be million for employee benefit plans all of which resides with mhc following piccadilly s bankruptcy in fiscal 
we believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for mhc s portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of mhc and compass 
off balance sheet arrangements see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases and prior year franchise partnership guarantees 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is market participant based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
in the instance of a potential sale of a restaurant in a refranchising transaction  the expected purchase price is used as the estimate of fair value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one full year shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows  of which have been impaired to salvage value 
of the which remained  we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the restaurants and determined no impairment was necessary 
the remaining net book value of these restaurants was million at june  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
our goodwill totaled million at june  we perform tests for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use  estimates of sales proceeds and other measures  such as fair market price of our common stock  as evidenced by closing trading price 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if market conditions deteriorate  or if operating results decline unexpectedly  we may be required to record impairment charges 
our normal timing for the annual testing of goodwill is as of the end of our third fiscal quarter 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  given our lowered stock price and the continuation of negative same restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we tested our goodwill again during the fourth quarter and determined that certain of our goodwill was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million million  net of tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing the full value of our ruby tuesday concept goodwill 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method  which requires  among other things  that most assets and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values 
we record goodwill when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the determination of estimated fair values of assets and liabilities requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the estimated future cash flows  estimated useful lives of assets  and appropriate discount rates 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities assumed from our lime fresh and franchisee acquisitions are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocations may change during the allowable allocation period under accounting standards codification topic  business combinations  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require a change to our estimates 
share based employee compensation share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to approval of the award by our board of directors 
we determine the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items 
we record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when certain state net operating losses that  in the judgment of management  are not more likely than not to be realized 
this determination factors in the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
as a result of state tax planning  the company has a three year cumulative pre tax loss in certain states which is to be given significant weight in our assessments 
we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million as of june  as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we record appropriate accruals for potential exposures should a taxing authority take a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these accruals  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate tax liability 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
we record the estimated future lease obligations on closed leased restaurants for which we have not sublet or settled the lease with the respective landlord as of a quarter end date 
inherent in these estimates is an assumption on the time period we anticipate it will take to reach a settlement with our landlord or to execute on a sublease agreement 
we calculate the lease obligation as the present value of future minimum net lease or settlement payments using a discount rate that takes into account the remaining time period prior to the estimated date of resolution 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our estimated lease obligations as of june  and may  were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition for franchisees we charge our franchisees various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and an advertising fee of up to 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary 
we also do not recognize franchise fee revenue from franchises with fees in excess of days past due 
unearned income for franchise fees was negligible and million as of june  and may   respectively  which is included in other deferred liabilities and or accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information relating to the write off of certain unearned income for franchise fees in fiscal estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on the presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income 
this guidance is intended to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  our fiscal first quarter 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued guidance modifying the impairment test for goodwill by allowing businesses to first decide whether they need to do the two step impairment test 
under the guidance  a business no longer has to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it believes it is very likely that the reporting unit s fair value is less than the carrying value 
the guidance is effective for impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
under the guidance  testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill has been simplified 
the guidance allows an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an organization electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the organization determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the guidance is effective for impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after september  our fiscal 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
known events  uncertainties  and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility 
this strategy has periodically allowed us to repurchase rti common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased million shares of rti common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
as of june   the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased was million 
to the extent not funded with cash on hand  cash from operating activities  or proceeds from stock option exercises  future repurchases  if any  may be funded by sale leaseback transactions and borrowings on the credit facility 
the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
step down of chief executive officer on june   we announced that samuel e 
beall  iii  our founder  president  chief executive officer  and chairman of the board of directors  has decided to step down from management and the board of directors 
mr 
beall intends to step down once the company names his successor 
we anticipate that mr 
beall will step down from management and the board of directors prior to or on november  mr 
beall is entitled to receive his entire million pension payment in a lump sum six months following his retirement and we therefore expect that this payment will be made in fiscal due to the significance of mr 
beall s lump sum payment to the executive supplemental pension plan liability as a whole  the payment will constitute a partial plan settlement which will require a special valuation 
in addition to the expense we routinely record for the executive supplemental pension plan  a charge estimated to approximate million will then be recorded  representing the recognition of a pro rata portion calculated as the percentage reduction in the projected benefit obligation due to the lump sum payment of the then unrecognized loss recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 
sale leaseback transactions over the last three fiscal quarters  we have been pursuing sale leaseback transactions on a portion of our real estate in order to create greater financial flexibility 
we are targeting to raise approximately million of gross proceeds from these transactions to be utilized for debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases  and will give consideration to potential additional sale leaseback transactions should market demand and deal economics remain attractive 
during the year ended june   we completed the sale leaseback of the land and building for ten company owned ruby tuesday concept restaurants for gross cash proceeds of million  exclusive of transaction costs of approximately million 
equipment was not included 
the carrying value of the property sold was million 
the leases have been classified as operating leases and have initial terms of years  with renewal options of up to years 
net proceeds from the sale leaseback transactions were used to pay down certain of our mortgage loan obligations 
we realized gains on these transactions of million  which have been deferred and are being recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the leases 
the current and long term portions of the deferred gains are included in accrued liabilities rent and other and other deferred liabilities  respectively  in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
amortization of the deferred gains is included as a reduction to rent expense and is included within other restaurant operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sale leaseback transactions which occurred subsequent to june  but prior to the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
required registration of senior notes as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on may   we entered into an indenture among the company  certain subsidiaries of the company as guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association as trustee  governing the company s million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we have agreed to register with the sec notes having substantially identical terms as the senior notes  as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for the senior notes 
we have agreed i within days after the issue date of the senior notes  to file a registration statement enabling holders of the senior notes to exchange the privately placed notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical terms  ii to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within days after the issue date of the senior notes  iii to consummate the exchange offer within days after the issue date of the senior notes  and iv to file a shelf registration statement for resale of the notes if we cannot consummate the exchange offer within the time period listed above 
if we fail to meet these targets each  a registration default  the annual interest rate on the senior notes will increase by 
the annual interest rate on the senior notes will increase by an additional for each subsequent day period during which the registration default continues  up to a maximum additional interest rate of per year over the otherwise applicable annual interest rate of 
if we cure the registration default  the interest rate on the senior notes will revert to the original level 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders 
the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
fiscal year fiscal year contained weeks 
rti s fiscal year will contain weeks and end on june  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate  and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our base rate for borrowings is defined to be the higher of bank of america s prime lending rate  the federal funds rate plus  or an adjusted libo rate plus  plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin for our eurodollar borrowings ranges from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of an insignificant amount per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
