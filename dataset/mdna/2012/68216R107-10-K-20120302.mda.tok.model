item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section is intended to help potential investors understand our financial performance through a discussion of the factors affecting our financial condition at december  and  and our results of operations for the years ended december    and this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
omniamerican bancorp  inc did not exist at december   therefore  the information reflected in this section related to the year ended december  reflects the financial performance of omniamerican bank 
overview our results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by service charges and other fees  provision for loan losses  commissions  gains losses on sales of securities and loans  and other income 
our noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits  software and equipment maintenance  depreciation of furniture  software and equipment  fdic insurance  other operations  occupancy  professional and outside services expenses  and net losses on the write down of other real estate owned 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions such as changes in energy prices which have an impact on the texas economy and fluctuations in real estate values  as well as changes in interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations  or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
business strategy our primary objective is to operate as an independent  community oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas 
our board of directors has sought to accomplish this objective by adopting a business strategy designed to maintain profitability  a strong capital position  and high asset quality 
this business strategy includes the following elements providing exceptional customer service to attract and retain customers 
as a community oriented financial institution  we emphasize providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs 
we believe that our community orientation is attractive to our customers and distinguishes us from the larger banks that operate in our primary market area 
deepening our customer relationships 
we intend to expand our business by cross selling our loan and deposit products and services to our customers 
we offer a wide range of products and services that allow us to meet our customers banking needs and provide us diversification of revenue sources 
we offer our retail customers a comprehensive portfolio of deposit products  including checking  money market  savings  certificates of deposit  and individual retirement accounts  as well as lending products  including one to four family residential mortgage loans  new and used automobile loans  and individual lines of credit 
we provide our commercial customers an extensive array of deposit and lending products and cash management programs 
we intend to focus our business lending on small and medium sized businesses and cross sell the entire business banking relationship to these customers  including checking and savings deposits and business banking products and services  such as online cash management  remote deposit capture  and treasury management 

table of contents continuing to grow and diversify our loan portfolio 
our strategy for increasing net income includes increasing our loan originations and diversifying our loan portfolio 
we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of one to four family residential real estate loans  consumer loans  and indirect automobile loans  as well as commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans 
during the past five years  we have successfully transitioned from being a predominantly consumer focused institution to becoming a more diversified consumer and business lender 
our one to four family residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans  and commercial business loans increased to   and  respectively  of our total loans at december   from   and of our total loans at december   while our consumer loans decreased to of our total loans at december   compared to of our total loans at december  the increases in the percentages of one to four family residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans  and commercial business loans to total loans reflect our emphasis on diversifying our loan portfolio 
commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans generally are originated with higher interest rates compared to one to four family residential real estate loans and  therefore  have a positive effect on our interest rate spread and net interest income 
in addition  the majority of these loans are originated with adjustable interest rates  which assist us in managing interest rate risk 
maintaining our high level of asset quality through conservative underwriting guidelines and aggressive monitoring of our loan portfolio 
we introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place 
for example  a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of consumer loans which are generally considered to have higher risk than owner occupied one to four family residential loans 
for the years ended december  and  our average ratio of losses from consumer loans to average total loans was and  respectively 
our credit and collections department actively monitors the performance of our consumer and residential real estate loan portfolios 
when a loan becomes past due  we promptly contact the borrower by telephone or by written communication 
during each personal contact  the borrower is required to provide updated information and is counseled on the terms of the loan and the importance of making payments on or before the due date 
with respect to our commercial real estate and commercial business lending  collection efforts are carried out directly by our commercial loan officers 
commercial loan officers review past due accounts weekly and promptly contact delinquent borrowers 
past due notices are typically sent to commercial real estate customers and commercial business customers at days past due 
emphasizing our lower cost deposit products to reduce the funding costs of our loan growth 
we offer interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts  which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
for the years ended december    and  the average of our demand accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts represented   and  respectively  of average total deposits 
we intend to continue emphasizing demand accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts as a source of funding 
managing interest rate risk 
as with most financial institutions  successfully managing interest rate risk is an integral part of our business strategy 
management and the board of directors evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  and determine the level of risk that is appropriate and consistent with our capital levels  liquidity  and performance objectives 
in particular  during the current low interest rate environment  we have sought to minimize the risk of originating long term fixed rate loans by selling such loans in the secondary market  and in particular selling to fannie mae all qualifying one to four family fixed rate one to four family residential real estate loans with terms in excess of years 
in addition  a significant percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial business loans and consumer loans which generally have shorter terms and provide higher yields than one to four family residential real estate loans 
we also monitor the mix of our deposits  a majority of which have been lower cost demand deposits  money market deposits  and savings deposits 
our strategy is to continue managing interest rate risk in response to changes in the local and national economy and to increase our assets as we deploy the proceeds from our initial public stock offering 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses are particularly susceptible to change in the near term  due to changes in credit quality which are evidenced by trends in charge offs and in the volume and severity of past due loans 
in addition  our loan mix is changing as we increase our commercial real estate and commercial business lending 
commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally have greater credit risk than one to four family residential real estate and consumer loans due to these loans being larger in amount and non homogenous 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level to cover probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required  we record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
the estimate of our credit losses is applied to two general categories of loans loans that we evaluate individually for impairment pursuant to asc  receivables  and groups of loans with similar risk characteristics that we evaluate collectively for impairment pursuant to asc  contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio 
the factors used to evaluate the collectability of the loan portfolio include  but are not limited to  current economic conditions  our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the financial strength of the borrower  and estimated value of any underlying collateral 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
see also item business business of omniamerican bank allowance for loan losses 

table of contents impairment of investment securities 
the evaluation of the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment is also a critical accounting policy 
in evaluating the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment  management considers the issuer s credit rating  credit outlook  payment status and financial condition  the length of time the security has been in a loss position  the size of the loss position and other meaningful information 
if a decline in the fair value of an investment security below its cost is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
the amount of the credit related impairment write down is recognized in our earnings and the non credit related impairment for securities not expected to be sold is recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could cause us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these securities constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary 
these factors include failure to make scheduled principal and or interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions  and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
defined benefit retirement plan 
our costs and obligations related to our defined benefit pension plan are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed under asc topic  employers accounting for pensions 
management evaluates  reviews with the plan actuaries  and updates  as appropriate  the assumptions used in the determination of the pension obligation and expense and the fair value of pension assets  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets have a significant impact on the actuarially computed present value of future pension plan benefits that is recorded on the balance sheet as a liability and the corresponding pension expense 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
to compute our pension expense for the year ended december   we used actuarial assumptions that included a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate of  used in this calculation  is the rate used in computing the benefit obligation as of december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of is based on the weighted average expected long term returns for the target allocation of plan assets as of the measurement date  december   and was developed through analysis of historical market returns  current market conditions and the pension plan assets past experience 
although we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information 
income taxes 
omniamerican bank became a taxable entity after converting from a credit union to a federally chartered savings bank on january  on that date  we established a net deferred tax asset of million as a result of timing differences for certain items  including depreciation of premises and equipment  unrealized gains and losses on investment securities  and bad debt deductions 
the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred tax asset is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment in their determination 
we assess the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information  and we maintain tax accruals consistent with our evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance that could affect the relative merits of the tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect our operating results 
in addition  positions we take in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review of the positions we have taken by taxing authorities could result in a material adjustment to our financial statements 
on january   we adopted authoritative guidance under asc topic  income taxes 
this authoritative guidance prescribes a more likely 
table of contents than not recognition threshold and measurement attribute the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with tax authorities for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

comparison of financial condition at december  and assets 
total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily the result of increases in securities classified as available for sale of million and loans  net of the allowance for loan losses and deferred fees and discounts  of million  partially offset by a decrease in other real estate owned of million 
cash and cash equivalents 
total cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in total cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to million in cash used to purchase securities classified as available for sale and million in cash used to originate loans

securities 
securities classified as available for sale increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in securities classified as available for sale during the year ended december   reflected purchases of million during the year ended december   of which million was related to the implementation of an investment strategy which allowed us to utilize our excess capital to generate interest income 
due to the steepening of the yield curve  we were able to achieve a favorable interest rate margin between mortgage backed securities investments and laddered maturity advances from the federal home loan bank  which is intended to provide increased earnings at a time when it would not be prudent to aggressively originate loans as a result of the relatively weak economy and our conservative underwriting standards 
partially offsetting the increase due to purchases were decreases of million from sales of securities  including the entire portfolio of trust preferred securities and private label cmos 
principal repayments  maturities  and calls totaled million

other real estate owned 
other real estate owned decreased million  or to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the sales of other real estate owned properties totaling million and write downs of the values of other real estate owned properties to the current fair values less costs to sell totaling million  partially offset by million in loans reclassified to other real estate owned

noninterest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in net gains on the sales and calls of securities available for sale  consisting of mortgage backed securities and agency bonds  a  decrease in service charges and other fees due to a significant decrease in insufficient funds and overdraft fees  and a  decrease in net gains on the sale of loans  primarily one to four family residential real estate loans 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in real estate owned expense of  professional and outside services of  and marketing expense of  partially offset by decreases in the fdic insurance assessment of  depreciation expense on furniture  software and equipment of  occupancy expense of  and service fees expense of  the increase in real estate owned expense was due primarily to increases in property tax  repairs and maintenance  and other expenses related to the increase in properties held as other real estate owed 
the increase in professional and outside services was primarily attributed to additional accounting  legal and consulting expenses to meet the reporting and compliance requirements of being a publicly traded company 
the increase in marketing expense was due primarily to a debit card rewards program offered to customers 
the decrease in the fdic insurance assessment was primarily attributable to a  special assessment incurred in the prior year period and a decrease in the general assessment rate for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation expense on furniture  software and equipment for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to assets fully depreciated at december  the decrease in occupancy expense was due primarily to a reduction in property taxes after property values were reduced for certain administrative office and branch locations 
the decrease in service fees expense was primarily due to our conversion to in house item processing from outsourcing item processing in the prior year

table of contents we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows and borrowing maturities  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are affected by our operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period

in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in undisbursed lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totalled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered

federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand and to purchase investment securities 
at december   we had the ability to borrow up to million from the federal home loan bank of dallas 
in addition  we maintained million in federal funds lines with other financial institutions at december  we also have a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of dallas which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis at a fixed term with pledged assignments

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
us gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates  and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current economic conditions 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i sell the long term  fixed rate one to four family residential real estate loans terms greater than years that we originate into the secondary mortgage market  ii lengthen the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer term wholesale funding sources such as fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of dallas  iii invest in shorter to medium term securities  iv originate commercial business and consumer loans  which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential real estate loans  and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  v maintain adequate levels of capital  and vi evaluate the performance of the leveraging strategy by utilizing our internal measuring and monitoring system which includes interest rate sensitivity analysis 
we have not engaged in hedging through the use of derivatives 

table of contents net portfolio value 
we currently use a net portfolio value npv analysis to monitor our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or basis point decrease in the united states treasury yield curve with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the table below sets forth  as of december   our calculation of the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated immediate changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model which is also summarized in the table below at december  at december  change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets net interest income npv ratio increase decrease basis points estimated net interest income increase decrease in estimated net interest income amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
the model illustrates the change in the economic value of our assets and liabilities at december  assuming an immediate change in interest rates 
the table above indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
the bank s asset liability management strategy sets acceptable limits to the percentage change in npv given changes in interest rates 
for instantaneous  parallel and sustained interest rate increases of and basis points  the bank s policy indicates that the npv ratio should not fall below 
as illustrated in the foregoing table  the bank was within policy limits 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous  or basis point increase or a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as of december   using 
table of contents our internal interest rate risk model  we estimated that our net interest income for the year ended december  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates  and would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point decrease in market interest rates 
we use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if there is a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
