this item provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
overview we are a medical device company incorporated as a delaware corporation in  engaged in the design  development  sales and marketing of implantable medical devices that provide a unique neuromodulation therapy  vagus nerve stimulation therapy vns therapy  for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and treatment resistant depression trd and other device solutions for the management of epilepsy 
our proprietary vns therapy system includes the following an implantable pulse generator to provide the appropriate stimulation to the vagus nerve  a lead that connects the generator to the vagus nerve  associated equipment to assist with the implant procedure  equipment to assist the treating physician with setting the stimulation parameters for each patient  appropriate instruction manuals  and magnets to temporarily suspend or induce stimulation manually 
the vns therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted  generally during an outpatient procedure 
the battery contained in the generator has a finite life  which varies according to the model and the stimulation parameters and settings used for each patient 
at or near the end of the useful life of a battery  a patient may  with the advice of a physician  choose to implant a new generator with or without replacing the original lead 
we sell the vns therapy system to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers ascs on payment terms that are generally days from the shipment date 
our ability to successfully expand the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable insurance coverage  coding and reimbursement for the device  the implant procedure and follow up care 
currently  there is broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  which we estimate pays for approximately of the vns therapy system implants  issues an annual update to the reimbursement amounts to be received by our customers 
there can be no assurance that future changes to cms reimbursement will not have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
a decrease in reimbursement rates or a change in reimbursement methodology by cms could have an adverse impact on our business and our future operating results 
we continue to work with cms to ensure favorable and appropriate reimbursement for our products and related procedures 
we continue to invest and support the development of future generations of our vns therapy system  including generators employing new stimulation paradigms  cardiac and brain based seizure detection  rechargeable battery technology and wireless communication technology 
we also continue to fund and develop other devices that support our focus on device solutions for epilepsy management  such as event monitoring  logging and notification technology using external heart monitoring and movement related sensor advancements 
we sponsor post marketing studies in appropriate indications  including treatment resistant depression trd  to build clinical evidence for vns therapy 
in addition  we are investing in pre clinical research related to the use of vns therapy for the treatment of chronic heart failure 

table of contents in august  we announced that we discovered a hardware related design issue with the aspirehc high capacity model and aspiresr seizure response model generators 
the hardware related design issue did not affect earlier models of our pulse generator  and we continued to sell earlier models 
we found that the stimulation output current delivered by the aspirehc and aspiresr generators to a patient s nerve could be less than the output current programmed by a physician 
while we believe that the generators do not pose an immediate health risk to patients  we i stopped shipment of aspirehc and aspiresr generators  ii suspended enrollment in our e aspiresr generator clinical trial  iii notified physicians treating patients implanted with the aspirehc generator of the issue and what to consider as they monitor these patients  iv withdrew the aspirehc and aspiresr generators from the field  v identified the cause of the problem and implemented and tested the solution  and vi submitted applications to both the fda and the european notified body  dekra  for the approval of the improved aspirehc generator 
in december  the fda approved our re designed aspirehc generator and we resumed our limited commercial release of the generator in the us with ce mark approval from dekra in november  we are planning to resume limited commercial release in europe 
in april  we commenced a european clinical trial e to support regulatory approval in europe of our aspiresr generator with the first human implant 
the aspiresr generator is a device that employs a cardiac based seizure detection system and delivers responsive vns therapy 
we suspended this trial in august  however  we re submitted the appropriate applications and have received approval to re start the trial  and are currently screening patients 
proprietary protection for our products is important to our business 
we seek us and foreign patents on selected inventions  acquire licenses under selected patents of third parties  and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  vendors and consultants with respect to technology that we consider important to our business 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
under the terms of our epilepsy patent license agreement  we paid royalties at a rate of of net sales of generators and leads 
the epilepsy patent expired on july  in the us and  as a result  we discontinued paying this royalty 
also  as a result of the epilepsy patent expiration  competitors may enter this market 
for instance  a company based in europe  neurotech  sa  has obtained ce mark approval for a device capable of vagus nerve stimulation  however the device is not yet marketed 
another company  cerebralrx ltd 
based in israel  developed an implantable device capable of vagus nerve stimulation and has ce mark approval 
cerebralrx has initiated commercialization efforts in several european countries 
we continuously evaluate whether to out license or to in license intellectual property rights to optimize our portfolio 
this includes identifying our intellectual property rights for indications we do not have plans to develop and determining whether these rights can be licensed or otherwise granted to third parties 
it also involves assessing the intellectual property rights owned by third parties to determine whether we should attempt to license or otherwise acquire those rights 
we have entered into several license and technology agreements that may involve substantial future payments  see note commitments and contingencies license agreements in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in order to accommodate expected growth of our business  to secure our future in our current manufacturing and headquarters facility and to realize operating efficiencies  we purchased the building and property in which we are headquartered during the quarter ended october  our headquarters building is located in houston  texas and consists of approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space 
we currently occupy approximately of this space 
in addition  as part of our disaster contingency plans  we lease a  square foot facility in austin  texas that we utilize for warehousing and distribution 
we are currently negotiating terms for the construction of a second manufacturing facility to be located in costa rica 
we intend for this facility to manufacture product for our international markets and to be completed in fiscal year and operational in fiscal year we also lease  square feet of overseas administrative and sales office space primarily in brussels  belgium and elsewhere in europe  china and hong kong 

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation  or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas requiring management s judgment that we consider critical intangible assets intangible assets  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  consisted of purchased licenses of patents and technology rights that are feasible and ready to integrate into our products 
the technology rights are purchased from our collaborative partners and pertain primarily to seizure detection  wireless communication  rechargeable battery technology  external charging accessory hardware and associated software  an implantable lead and micro processor technologies 
we amortize our intangible assets on a straight line basis  over an average period of years  beginning with the effective date of the license agreement and ending with the shorter of either the expiration of the license or with the estimated end of the useful life of the product 
we evaluate our intellectual property each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances indicate either a different amortization period or impairment 
the intangible asset is impaired if the technology no longer factors into our product commercialization plans 
the risks associated with achieving commercialization include  but are not limited to  failure of the acquired technology to function as planned  failure to obtain regulatory approvals for clinical trials  failure of clinical trials  failure to obtain regulatory approval to market  failure to obtain insurance reimbursement and patent litigation 
amortization and impairment are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment 
if we change our estimate of the useful lives of our intellectual property  we amortize the carrying amount over the revised remaining useful life 
if we identify an impairment indicator  we test the intellectual property for recoverability  and if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying value of our intangible assets amounted to million at april  investments in debt and equity securities we have invested in two privately held entities with a total carrying value of million as of april  the first investment is convertible debt  which we account for at fair value as an available for sale debt security 
the second investment consists of convertible preferred shares accounted for under the cost method 
we own less than of the equity in the second entity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee 
this investment has not been impaired because there have been no identified events or changes in circumstances that indicate a significant adverse effect on its fair value 
impairment and fair value adjustments are subject to a high degree management judgment as these investments do not have quoted market prices 
we cannot guarantee that such investments will be successful or will not adversely affect our consolidated balance sheet  statement of income or cash flow 
see note long term investments in debt and equity securities and note fair value measurements  for further details of these investments 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue we sell our products through a direct sales force in the us and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in international markets 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfers to customers or our independent distributors 
we maintain policies for sales returns and exchanges 
we estimate sales returns based on historical data and we record a reduction in sales and a return reserve when we sell the initial product 
the balance of our reserve for sales returns for the fiscal years ending april  and april  was million and million  respectively 
our increasing business activity  new product introductions and variations in product utilization could cause product returns to differ from our estimates 
license revenue we amortize upfront payments received under license agreements over the life of our obligations under the agreements to prosecute the licensed patent applications 
effective in december  we entered into an agreement granting an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications pertaining to weight reduction  hypertension and diabetes in exchange for an up front  non refundable payment of million  plus a royalty on future commercial sales of any product covered by the licensed patents 
we retain the responsibility to prosecute the licensed patent applications and estimate that our obligation will be satisfied by april accordingly  we have recognized revenue of approximately million per quarter based on the straight line amortization of the million payment 
however  a change in our estimate of the amortization period or a release of our obligation to prosecute the patent applications could materially change the timing of the recognition of the license revenue 
stock based compensation stock option awards our stock option award compensation expense is based on the fair market value of our awards 
the fair market value of an award is amortized over the award vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing methodology to estimate the grant date fair market value of stock option award 
this methodology takes into account variables such as the future expected volatility of our stock price  the amount of time expected to elapse between the date of grant and the date of exercise and a risk free interest rate 
fair values of stock options issued in the future may vary significantly from fair values recorded in the current period depending on our estimates of these variables and therefore expense in future periods may differ significantly from current period stock option compensation expenses 
in addition  compensation expense may vary significantly from our estimates if forfeiture rates differ from our expectations 
the estimated forfeiture rate used for stock option awards granted during the fiscal year ended april  ranged from to 
recognized compensation cost for stock option awards for the weeks ended april   weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april  was million  million and million  respectively 
restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards service based restricted stock 
we grant restricted stock and restricted stock units at no purchase cost to the grantee 
the fair market values of serviced based restricted stock and restricted stock units are determined using the market closing price on the grant date and compensation is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
calculation of compensation for service based restricted share awards requires estimation of employee turnover and forfeiture rates 
compensation expense may vary significantly from our estimates if employee turnover rates differ from our expectations 
the estimated forfeiture rates used for restricted share awards and share unit awards during the fiscal year ended april  ranged from to 

table of contents market and performance based restricted stock and performance based restricted stock units 
we grant restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards subject to market or performance conditions that vest based on the satisfaction of the conditions of the award 
the fair market values of market condition based awards are determined using the monte carlo simulation method 
the monte carlo simulation method is subject to variability as several factors utilized must be estimated  including the derived service period estimate based on our judgment of likely future performance and our stock price volatility 
the fair value of performance based awards is based on the market closing price on the grant date 
derived service periods and the periods charged with compensation expense for performance based awards are estimated based on our judgment of likely future performance and may be adjusted significantly in future periods depending on actual performance 
recognized compensation cost for service based  performance based and market based restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for the weeks ended april   the weeks ended april  and the weeks ended april  was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to federal  state and foreign income taxes  and we use significant judgment and estimates in accounting for our income taxes 
this involves assessing the changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of events for tax and accounting purposes 
these assessments result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense compared to pre tax income yields an effective tax rate 
actual tax expense may significantly differ from our expectations if  for example  judicial interpretations of tax law or tax rates change 
cumulative adjustments to the tax provision are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual effective rate is determined 
we periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets by considering whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the actual benefit of those assets will be realized 
to the extent that realization does not meet the more likely than not criterion  we establish a valuation allowance 
we periodically review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance by considering significant positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets and to determine the timing and amount of valuation allowance that should be released 
this evidence includes a profitability in the most recent fiscal years  b internal forecasts for the current and next two future fiscal years  c size of the deferred tax asset relative to estimated profitability  d the potential effects on future profitability from increasing competition  healthcare reforms and overall economic conditions  e limitations and potential limitations on the use of our net operating losses due to ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code irc section  and f the implementation of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  if any 
projecting future taxable income requires significant judgment about the trend and nature of our sales and operating expenses  which include an evaluation of the potential effects of new markets  changing technology  patent protection  governmental and private insurance reimbursement trends and regulatory trends 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets could result in materially different income tax provisions 
during fiscal  based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  of which million was recorded as a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income and million was recorded as a benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
during fiscal  based on our evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we reduced our valuation allowance by million 
this reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded as a tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income 
at april   we had a valuation allowance of million against the net operating losses from our foreign operations and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
the net operating losses for the excess tax benefits from stock based awards are deemed more likely than not to be realized  however  the associated valuation allowance will not be released until the benefit is used to reduce income taxes payable 
the benefit will be recorded in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet 
our foreignnet operating losses are not likely to be realized and consequently the associated valuation allowance has not been released 

table of contents we operate in europe with a subsidiary  cyberonics europe bvba sprl cyberonics europe bvba 
cyberonics europe bvba  based in belgium  is the successor organization arising from the restructuring of cyberonics  nv sa  which was also based in belgium 
we made an election to treat cyberonics europe bvba as a disregarded entity for us federal tax purposes during fiscal in conjunction with this transaction  we recognized a net million income tax benefit resulting from claiming a worthless stock deduction with respect to the shares we own in cyberonics europe bvba 
the internal revenue service irs could challenge the characterization of this type of transaction 
the resolution of any challenge could result in reversal of all  part or none of the benefit recorded during fiscal year consequently  we have estimated and recorded a million liability for uncertain tax benefits  which increased our income tax provision 
changes in our assessment of the factors related to sustainability of this deduction would have resulted in a materially different income tax provision 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year is approximately  including the impact of federal tax rate of  state and foreign income taxes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will be between approximately and 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate will be due primarily to permanent differences including the research and development tax credit which expired effective december   meals and entertainment expenditures  the domestic manufacturing deduction  and other compensation related differences 
the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the possible reenactment of the research development tax credit  the potential increase in the research development tax credit percentage  and the retroactive nature of the research development tax credit may have an impact on the effective tax rate in subsequent years 
also  other permanent differences including differences related to meals and entertainment  compensation  and the domestic manufacturing deduction will impact the effective tax rate in subsequent years 
our cash payments for income taxes for fiscal year were approximately of income before tax 
we estimate similar cash tax payments for fiscal years and increased cash tax payments in fiscal year due to the full utilization of our tax net operating losses 
tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes 
we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our tax positions in order to determine the appropriateness of our reserves for uncertain tax positions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of these audits and the actual outcome of an audit could have a material impact on our consolidated results of income  financial position or cash flows

we are evaluating the impact of section of the internal revenue code  enacted by the health care and education reconciliation act of in conjunction with the patient protection and affordable care act  which proposes a excise tax on medical devices sold domestically 
we expect that the full year impact of the tax in our fiscal year will be in excess of million and there is no assurance that we will be able to increase prices or reduce expenses sufficiently to offset this tax 
we anticipate that this excise tax will negatively impact our income before income taxes beginning in january income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal year is approximately including the impact of the federal tax rate of  state and foreign income taxes 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will be between approximately and 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate are primarily due to permanent differences including the research and development tax credit  meals and entertainment expenditures  the domestic manufacturing deduction  and other compensation related differences 
our cash payments for income taxes for fiscal year were approximately of income before tax

our foreign net operating losses are not likely to be realized and consequently  the associated valuation allowance has not been released and it is unlikely to be released in the subsequent fiscal years 

table of contents during fiscal year  we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets using the criteria described above and  as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance by million  which resulted in a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of income of million and a benefit in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet of million 
prior to the fiscal year  all of our deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance 
during fiscal year  we evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  as a result  reduced our related valuation allowance by million

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million during the weeks ended april   as compared to an increase of million during the weeks ended april   and a decrease of million during the weeks ended april  the reasons for the changes in our cash and cash equivalents balances are discussed below 

table of contents cash flows net cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities and the net increase decrease in the balance of cash and cash equivalents were as follows in thousands weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended april  april  april  operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  was million  which was primarily due to net income of million plus non cash income and expense items of million and cash provided by operating assets and liabilities of million 
non cash items consisted primarily of deferred income tax expense of million and share based compensation expense of million 
cash provided by operating assets included a decrease in inventories of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
inventories decreased in the us primarily due to the effects of the product retrieval and discontinued product 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased due to increased compensation accruals based on increased sales and increased current income taxes payables  offset by a decrease in our royalty accrual 
cash used by operating assets included increased trade accounts receivables of million  primarily caused by increased sales 
cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  was million  which was primarily due to net income of million  plus non cash items of million  offset by increased operating assets of million and decreased operating liabilities of million 
operating assets increased primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories  both of which were driven by increasing sales 
operating liabilities decreased primarily due to decreased annual non sales compensation 
cash provided by operating activities during the weeks ended april  was million  which was primarily due to income from operations of million  which included non cash items of million and increased operating liabilities of million  offset by increased operating asset of million  primarily due to trade accounts receivable and inventory 
the increase in operating liabilities was primarily due to increased compensation due to higher sales and the timing of compensation payments  including a change of bonus payments to annual from semi annual and the timing of the final payday in the fiscal year 
trade accounts payable and inventories increased primarily due to increased sales 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during the weeks ended april  was million  which was primarily due to the acquisition of our headquarters land and building for million in september  purchases of property and equipment of million  a million acquisition of a noncontrolling equity interest in imthera medical  inc  a privately held company focused on the development of a neurostimulation device for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea  and a million investment in intangible assets used in the development of aspiresr and proguardian

risk factors above 
factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from foreign currency exchange rates  concentration of credit and concentration of procurement suppliers that could adversely affect our consolidated balance sheet  net income and cash flow 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  at certain times  derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings  particularly with respect to the us dollar versus the euro and great britain pound 
starting in the second quarter of fiscal year and ending in the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated primarily by a foreign currency denominated receivable from our european subsidiary 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recapitalized our european subsidiary  eliminated the inter company euro receivable  and as a consequence  did not purchase a foreign currency derivative in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the future  we may use non speculative hedging to reduce our exposure to foreign currency transactions depending on cash flow in our european operations 
we choose not to offset other foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to immateriality  accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of offsetting particular exposures 
based on our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  and not taking into consideration foreign currency derivative offsets  a sensitivity analysis indicates that if the us dollar had uniformly weakened against the euro and the great britain pound  the effect on net income after tax for the weeks ended april  would have been unfavorable by approximately  or 
conversely  if the us dollar had uniformly strengthened against the euro and the great britain pound  the impact on net income after tax for the weeks ended april  would have been favorable by approximately  or 
concentration of credit risk our trade accounts receivable represent potential concentrations of credit risk 
this risk is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas 
in addition  historically we have had strong collections and minimal write offs 
however  essentially all of our trade receivables are concentrated in the hospital and healthcare sectors in the us and several other countries  and accordingly  we are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
although we do not currently foresee a concentrated credit risk associated with these receivables  repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economies and healthcare systems 
for instance  our trade receivables in italy and spain at april   amounted to approximately million  with a reserve for losses of million 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and we believe that our reserves for losses are adequate
