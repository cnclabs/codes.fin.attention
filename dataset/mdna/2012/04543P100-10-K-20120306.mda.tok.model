company overview we have been purchasing and collecting charged off accounts receivable portfolios paper from consumer credit originators since charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers including private label card issuers  consumer finance companies  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we purchase them at a substantial discount 
over the last ten years  we purchased  consumer debt portfolios  with an original charged off face value of billion for an aggregate purchase price of billion  or of face value  net of buybacks 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize collections 
macro economic factors have impacted our results of operations both positively and negatively in recent years 
factors such as reduced availability of credit for consumers  a depressed housing market  elevated unemployment rates and other factors have had a negative impact on us by making it more difficult to collect from consumers on the paper we have acquired 
we have observed recent positive trends in some of these indicators 
for example  the average unemployment rate of for is lower than the average unemployment rate for both and conversely  while the supply of paper increased and prices dropped during and  we have recently observed increased competition for available paper as well as a reduction in the supply of paper from certain credit originators 
these factors contributed to the higher pricing we experienced during  and are likely to impact pricing of paper in we expect macro economic trends to continue to impact portfolio acquisition and collection results 
higher prices for paper are likely to continue in the near term  which will put additional pressure on our ability to be profitable 
one of our measures of our ability to be profitable is cost as a percent of collections of charged off receivables  referred to as cost to collect 
we have been reviewing our operating model in recent years  including our facilities  and making changes in order to reduce our cost to collect 
recent changes are described in more detail below 
those actions allowed us to reduce our cost to collect to in from in however  some of our competitors have significantly lower levels of costs as a percent of collections  which may allow them to offer higher amounts for purchasing paper 
we expect to continue to review our operations and collection activities to identify additional opportunities to reduce our cost structure in order to remain competitive 
our levels of purchasing showed year over year growth in both and during  we purchased more paper than in with a higher percentage of older paper than the previous year 
during  we purchased more paper than in these increased levels of purchases contributed to increased collections in we saw an increase in pricing of paper in  primarily in the newer stages of delinquency 
we deploy our capital within the stages of delinquency based upon availability and our perception of the relative value of the available debt 

table of contents we executed an amended and restated credit agreement in the fourth quarter of which replaced our previous credit facilities that would have expired beginning in june although the rates of interest in the new agreement are higher than in our prior agreement  the financial covenants are more favorable and we believe the refinancing will allow us to continue to purchase paper at or above prior levels without disruption to our operating plans 
collections during increased as compared to and each fiscal quarter of showed year over year growth 
improved collection results were driven by higher levels of purchasing in and  as collections on portfolios are typically highest six to months after purchase 
collections were also positively impacted by a combination of improved analytical tools used to create customized collection strategies and continued improvement in the utilization of our proprietary collection platform  which led to an increase in collector productivity 
we grew collections for the year even though we closed three collection offices in and have not been purchasing or collecting healthcare receivables since the third quarter of purchased receivable revenues for were significantly higher than last year 
this increase in revenue is primarily related to higher collections driven by improved collection strategies and analytics  higher average carrying balances of purchased receivables  increases in net impairment reversals and greater zero basis collections collections on fully amortized portfolios 
during  we exceeded collection forecasts for certain portfolios allowing us to recognize yield increases and reverse certain previously recorded impairments 
if collections continue to exceed our expectations  we may further increase yields or reverse additional impairments 
however  if collections do not continue to meet expectations  we may be required to record impairments 
the increase in revenue from zero basis collections directly impacted purchased receivable revenues  as collections on fully amortized pools are recognized as revenue in the period collected 
fully amortized portfolios are generally at least five years old  and become more difficult to collect as they continue to age 
in january we settled the ftc s investigation into our debt collection practices  which has resulted in some changes to our practices and procedures in collecting consumer debt 
refer to legal proceedings for additional information of the ftc investigation 
in addition to the items discussed above  our results of operations are influenced by certain industry and economic trends  including levels of outstanding consumer credit according to the us federal reserve board  the amount of outstanding revolving and non revolving consumer credit was trillion in december  which is consistent with the level of outstanding consumer credit in recent years 
the level of consumer debt obligations indicates potential future charge offs and availability of paper 
tightening credit standards or other factors in the future may result in lower consumer credit outstanding 
charge off rates according to the us federal reserve board  the charge off rate  the rate at which accounts are charged off measured as a percentage of total outstanding consumer credit  decreased during in addition  the average charge off rate for was lower than the average charge off rate for if other factors remain constant  lower charge off rates could result in fewer accounts available for purchase in the market  and may result in higher pricing 
supply and pricing environment for purchased receivables the supply and pricing of purchased receivables available in the market is influenced by the levels of outstanding consumer credit  charge off rates and competition among buyers  among other factors 
in general  prices increased in for paper in all stages of delinquency  with the most significant change in the fresh and primary segments 
impact of macro economic factors macro economic factors affect consumers ability to satisfy outstanding debt 
the residential real estate market in the united states began to experience a significant downturn in the second half of and real estate values generally remained depressed 
table of contents during the unemployment rate and the number of individual bankruptcy filings showed improvement during  but remained elevated compared to historical levels  leaving individual consumers with fewer resources available to satisfy their debts and contributed to a continuing challenging collection environment 
operating expenses during were favorable compared to  primarily as a result of actions we took in to restructure our operations 
the following is a summary of those actions exited the purchase and collection of healthcare receivables during  we exited the healthcare accounts receivable purchase and collection activities conducted by our former parc subsidiary and sold substantially all of our healthcare receivables to a third party 
because of the sale  we will forego future collections on these accounts 
the historical impact of these collections was as follows twelve months ended december  in thousands collections from non healthcare receivables collections from healthcare receivables total collections closed collection offices in connection with ceasing the purchase and collection of healthcare receivables  we closed our deerfield beach office and dissolved our parc subsidiary 
in addition  we closed our chicago and cleveland call center collection operations and shifted their inventory of receivables to other collection channels 
these office closures significantly reduced our account representative headcount and our call center footprint  removed redundancy and simplified our infrastructure needs 
terminated third party agency relationship we incurred a charge of million in resulting from the termination for performance of a relationship with a third party service provider third party charge 
the charge related to a cash payment to reimburse the third party for court costs incurred on our behalf that they would otherwise have recovered through commissions in subsequent periods 
acquisition in july of  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of bsi esolutions  llc bsi  a software vendor  including the collection software it developed  which we had been implementing to replace our legacy collection platform 
we made the acquisition to protect our investment in the software acquired and to enhance our ability to successfully complete implementation 
in addition  we believe this acquisition allows us to further enhance our collection platform in an efficient and cost effective manner 
in we completed the follow action announced the closure of our san antonio office we closed our san antonio call center collection operation in january and shifted its inventory of receivables to other collection channels 
in conjunction with closing this office  we incurred restructuring charges of million during the fourth quarter of and anticipate million in the first half of we expect this restructuring action to improve future annual adjusted ebitda by approximately million per year 
we continually review our business and operations and look for opportunities to become more efficient 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues and as a percentage of cash collections for the periods indicated percent of total revenues percent of cash collections years ended december  years ended december  revenues purchased receivable revenues gain on sale of purchased receivables other revenues total revenues expenses salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring charges impairment of assets loss on disposal of equipment and other assets total operating expense income loss from operations other income expense interest expense interest income loss on extinguishment of debt other income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of charged off consumer receivables 
we refer to revenue generated from this line of business as purchased receivable revenues 
purchased receivable revenues is the difference between cash collections and amortization of purchased receivables 
the following table summarizes our purchased receivable revenues including cash collections and amortization years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change cash collections purchased receivable amortization purchased receivable revenues 
table of contents the increase in cash collections for the year ended december  was a result of a combination of higher levels of recent purchasing  improved use of analytical tools and continued improvement in the utilization of our proprietary collection platform  which provided efficiencies that helped improve collector productivity  particularly in our legal collections channel 
refer to the cash collections tables on page for additional information on collections by channel 
although the overall collection environment remained challenging  we saw some improvement in general macro economic factors  which improved debtor s ability to repay their obligations 
compared to prior year results  investment in purchased receivables increased by in and in generally  collections are strongest on portfolios six to months after purchase  therefore  these increases have had a positive impact on current collections 
cash collections included collections from fully amortized portfolios  or zero basis collections  of million and million for and  respectively  of which was reported as revenue 
the increase in these collections was a result of shifts in our work strategy and other initiatives 
the amortization rate of for the year ended december  was basis points lower than the amortization rate of for the same period of the decline in the amortization rate was a result of higher weighted average yields  higher net impairment reversals and higher zero basis collections 
during  we increased yields on multiple portfolios from the through vintages  which results in a higher percentage of cash collections being applied to purchased receivable revenue and less to amortization 
increases in assigned yields are generally a result of increases in expected future collections 
we recognized net impairment reversals of million during the year compared to net impairment reversals of million in these impairment reversals were also a result of increased expectations for future collections on certain portfolios from the through vintages 
the increase in zero basis collections in also reduced the amortization rate since those collections are recorded as revenue in the period collected 
refer to supplemental performance data on pages and for a summary of purchased receivable revenues and amortization rates by year of purchase and an analysis of the components of collections and amortization 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers were million and million during and  respectively 
the top three sellers were the same in both twelve month periods 
investments in purchased receivables we generate revenue from our investments in portfolios of charged off consumer accounts receivable 
ongoing investments in purchased receivables are critical to continued generation of revenues 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  type and demographics 
as a result  the cost of our purchases  as a percent of face value  may fluctuate from one period to the next 
total purchases consisted of the following years ended december  in millions  net of buybacks change percent acquisitions of purchased receivables  at cost acquisitions of purchased receivables  at face value percentage of face value percentage of forward flow purchases  at cost of total purchasing percentage of forward flow purchases  at face value of total purchasing our investment in purchased receivables increased in compared to the prior year  which was consistent with our strategy to increase purchasing levels over those in the face value of purchased receivables increased by a greater percentage than the amount paid as a result of a lower average cost of purchases in because we purchased a higher percentage of older paper during the year 
for instance  we purchased less than of paper in the fresh and primary stages of delinquency in compared to over in fresh and 
table of contents primary paper generally have a higher purchase price than paper in the other stages of delinquency 
as a result of fluctuations in the mix of purchases of receivables  the costs of our purchases  as a percent of face value  fluctuate from one period to the next and are not always indicative of our estimates of total return 
forward flow contracts commit a seller to sell charged off receivables to us for a fixed percentage of the face value over a specified time period 
purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
purchases from forward flows in included portfolios from forward flow contracts 
we bid on forward flow contracts based on their availability in the market and our evaluation of the relative value of the accounts 
as a result  our investment in purchased receivables through these agreements fluctuates from period to period 
operating expenses operating expenses are traditionally measured in relation to revenues  however  we measure operating expenses in relation to cash collections 
we believe this is appropriate because amortization rates  the difference between cash collections and revenues recognized  vary from year to year 
amortization rates vary due to seasonality of collections  impairments  impairment reversals and other factors and can distort the analysis of operating expenses when measured against revenues 
additionally  we believe a substantial portion of our operating expenses are variable in relation to cash collections 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our operating expenses years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change salaries and benefits collections expense occupancy administrative restructuring and impairment of assets other total operating expenses salaries and benefits 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our salaries and benefits expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change compensation revenue generating compensation administrative benefits and other total salaries and benefits compensation for our revenue generating departments was lower in due to lower average headcount of in house account representatives 
we significantly reduced headcount for our collection operations starting in the second half of in connection with our restructuring actions to close three collection offices 
during  we had an average of in house account representatives  including supervisors  compared to an average of in higher compensation for our administrative departments in was a result of the addition of new associates from the bsi acquisition in july and higher performance based incentive compensation for 
table of contents management 
benefits and other expenses related to compensation were slightly lower in  primarily as a result of a decline in the number of associates  offset in part by higher expenses for company contributions to our k plan  which were reinstated in the third quarter of  and our self insured medical programs 
collections expense 
the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaigns and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense forwarding fees include fees paid to third parties to collect on our behalf  including our agency firm in india 
these fees increased in compared to as a result of an increase in accounts placed with third party agencies and higher cash collections generated by third parties  primarily in our non legal channel 
collections from third party relationships were million and million  or and of cash collections  for and  respectively 
fees paid to agencies are typically a percentage of collections generated  with rates that vary based on the age and type of paper that we outsource 
our agency firm in india is paid a fixed rate per representative  along with certain performance incentives  so overall forwarding rates will vary based on the relative performance of this firm 
court costs related to our legal collections decreased year over year primarily as a result of a charge of million in resulting from the termination for performance of a relationship with a third party service provider 
excluding this charge  court costs increased in compared to as a result of higher legal activity driven by higher purchasing in and an increase in the number of accounts in the legal collection channel 
the legal collection model requires an up front investment in court costs and other fees  which we expense as incurred 
there generally is a considerable delay before we generate collections on the accounts in the legal process 
this delay can cause a change in court costs that is disproportionate to the change in legal collections 
as a result of our improved analytical capabilities and continuous review of operational strategies  we were able to more effectively utilize variable collection activities  such as dialing  lettering campaigns and use of data provider services  resulting in reductions in the related expenses 
generally  these costs are higher in the first six months after purchase of a portfolio as we initiate collection activities 
we were also able to favorably renegotiate the terms of certain telecommunications contracts  which helped reduce volume related expenses 
other collection expenses were lower in compared to as a result of actions taken to reduce technical and software support costs 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the restructuring actions to close our deerfield beach  chicago and cleveland collection offices during the second half of we continue to review our capacity to ensure we are utilizing all of our space effectively 
administrative 
administrative expenses decreased to million in from million for the decrease was primarily related to reductions in legal fees related to the ftc investigation and consulting fees 
total ftc charges were million and million in and  respectively 
each year included million of charges for an estimated civil penalty as part of the consent decree settlement 

table of contents restructuring and impairment of assets 
restructuring charges were million in compared to million in charges during were related to closing our san antonio  texas collection office 
charges during were related to closing three collection offices and exiting healthcare receivable purchase and collection activities 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for  an increase of million compared to million during during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a new amended and restated credit agreement  which resulted in higher interest and additional deferred financing costs  including an original issue discount of million that will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
in addition  the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average borrowings  which were million during compared to million in as a result of entering into the new credit agreement  interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of the original issue discount  will be higher in future periods than it would have been under the terms of the former credit agreement 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt was million in the loss related to the write off of the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs related to our prior term loan 
income taxes 
we recognized income tax expense of million for and a tax benefit of million for the current year tax expense reflects a federal tax rate of and a state tax rate of net of federal tax effect 
for  the federal tax rate was and state tax rate was net of federal tax effect 
the rate differed from the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to the additional accrual for the ftc non deductible civil penalty of million 
the rate differed from the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to our decision to dissolve parc  which resulted in i a benefit of million related to a worthless stock deduction to be claimed for our disposition of parc  ii a benefit of million related to the write off of intercompany advances to parc  iii an expense of million related to the write off of intangible assets associated with parc  and iv an expense of million related to the write off of parc s prior net operating losses that will no longer be recognizable in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from our main line of business  the purchase and collection of charged off consumer receivables 
we refer to revenue generated from this line of business as purchased receivable revenues 
purchased receivable revenues is the difference between cash collections and amortization of purchased receivables 
the following table summarizes our purchased receivable revenues including cash collections and amortization years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change cash collections purchased receivable amortization purchased receivable revenues the amortization rate of for the year ended december  was basis points lower than the amortization rate of for the same period of the improvement in the amortization rate was primarily 
table of contents a result of net impairments of million recorded in the impairments were a result of significant declines in expectations for future collections on certain portfolios  particularly in the to vintage years 
by contrast  results for included net impairment reversals of million 
even though amortization as a percent of collections was more favorable in compared to the prior year  revenues  absent the effect of impairments  were lower as a result of a decrease in collections on fully amortized portfolios  a lower average carrying value of purchased receivables as a result of the impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of  and lower average irrs on recent purchases 
refer to supplemental performance data on page and for a summary of purchased receivable revenues and amortization rates by year of purchase and an analysis of the components of collections and amortization 
we believe that macro economic factors affecting consumers liquidity and their ability to repay their obligations  and the low levels of purchasing in contributed to lower cash collections in compared to macro economic factors reducing consumers ability to pay included the average unemployment rate over the twelve month period  which increased from in december to in december  a depressed housing market and a continued tight credit environment for consumers  among other factors 
in addition  during  we invested less in purchased receivables than we did in generally  collections are strongest on portfolios six months to months after purchase  therefore  that reduction in purchasing had a negative impact on collections in  primarily during the first half of the year 
cash collections include collections from fully amortized portfolios of million and million for and  respectively  of which were reported as revenue 
these fully amortized portfolios are generally at least five years old  and become more difficult to collect as they continue to age 
revenues on portfolios purchased from our top three sellers were million and million during and  respectively 
the top three sellers were the same in both twelve month periods 
investments in purchased receivables we generate revenue from our investments in portfolios of charged off consumer accounts receivable 
ongoing investments in purchased receivables are critical to continued generation of revenues 
from period to period  we may buy charged off receivables of varying age  types and demographics

as a result of fluctuations in the mix of purchases of receivables  the costs of our purchases  as a percent of face value  fluctuate from one period to the next and are not always indicative of our estimates of total return 

table of contents investments under forward flow contracts forward flow contracts commit a debt seller to sell charged off receivables to us  and commit us to purchase receivables for a fixed percentage of the face value 
forward flow contracts may be attractive to us because they provide operational advantages from the consistent amount and type of accounts acquired

table of contents salaries and benefits 
the following table summarizes the significant components of our salaries and benefits expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change compensation revenue generating compensation administrative benefits and other total salaries and benefits compensation for our revenue generating departments was lower in due to lower average headcount of in house account representatives  partially offset by increased incentive compensation 
benefits were favorable to the prior year due to the suspension of the company matching component of our k plan and favorable healthcare benefit expenses  in part a result of increased associate contributions for these benefits 
collections expense 
the following table summarizes the significant components of collections expense years ended december  percentage of cash collections years ended december  in millions change percentage change forwarding fees court and process server costs lettering campaigns and telecommunications costs data provider costs other total collections expense forwarding fees include fees paid to third parties to collect on our behalf including our agency firm in india 
these fees increased in compared to because of higher cash collections generated by third parties  primarily driven by continued increases in non legal work allocated to our agency firm in india 
collections from such third party relationships were million and million  or and of cash collections  for and  respectively 
rates paid to forwarding agencies vary based on the age and type of paper that we outsource 
rates also vary based on the mix of work performed by our agency firm in india  which is generally at a lower rate than on collections we outsource domestically 
court costs increased year over year as we increased legal activity  and also because of increases in court filing fees in certain jurisdictions 
our legal collection model requires an up front investment in court costs and other fees before any collections are generated  and there may be considerable delay before we generate collections on the accounts in the legal process 
this delay can cause a change in court costs that is disproportionate to the change in legal collections 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million resulting from the termination for performance of a relationship with a third party service provider 
the charge relates to a cash settlement payment to reimburse the third party for court costs incurred on our behalf that the third party would otherwise have recovered through commissions in future periods 
during  we became more selective in our variable collection activities  such as telecommunications  lettering campaigns and use of data provider services  resulting in reductions in the related expenses 
generally  these costs are higher in the first six months after purchase of a portfolio as we ramp up collection activities 

table of contents occupancy 
occupancy expenses declined to million in from million in  primarily as a result of closing our deerfield beach and chicago collection offices during the year 
in addition  during  we entered into two new lease agreements to replace our facilities in san antonio and phoenix now located nearby in tempe 
the new lease agreements in san antonio and tempe are for less space than the prior agreements  which resulted in reduced occupancy expense during administrative 
administrative expenses increased to million in from million for the increase is primarily related to defense charges for the ftc investigation  including an accrual for estimated settlement of million  partially offset by a reduction in outside consulting fees 
restructuring and impairment of assets 
restructuring charges were million for and included charges related to exiting our healthcare receivable purchase and collection activities and closing three collection offices 
the charges included employee termination benefits of million  contract termination costs of million for remaining lease payments  write off of intangible assets of million and other exit costs  including the write off of furniture and equipment  of million 
we recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of related to trademark and trade names associated with our healthcare collection activities 
after the additional write off of million in  there was no longer a carrying value of trademark and trade names in our consolidated statements of financial position 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for  an increase of million compared to interest expense of million for during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we amended our credit agreement  which resulted in additional deferred financing costs that will be amortized over the remaining term of the credit agreement 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher amortization of these deferred financing costs of million 
in addition  the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in average borrowings  which were million during compared to million in the amendments to our credit agreement included an increase in average interest rates and changes to the financial covenants 
as a result  interest expense will be higher in future periods than it would have been under the terms of the agreement prior to amendment 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional information 
income taxes 
we recognized income tax benefits of million and million for and  respectively 
the current year tax benefit reflects a federal tax rate of and a state tax rate of net of federal tax effect 
for  the federal tax rate was and state tax rate was net of federal tax effect 
the rate differed from the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to our decision to dissolve parc  which resulted in i a benefit of million related to a worthless stock deduction to be claimed for our disposition of parc  ii a benefit of million related to the write off of intercompany advances to parc  iii an expense of million related to the write off of intangible assets associated with parc  and iv an expense of million related to the write off of parc s prior net operating losses that will no longer be recognizable in future periods 

table of contents supplemental performance data the following tables and analysis show select data related to our purchased receivables portfolios including purchase price  account volume and mix  historical collections  cumulative and estimated remaining collections  productivity and certain other data that we believe is important to understanding our business 
total estimated collections as a percentage of purchase price provides a view of how acquired portfolios are expected to perform in relation to initial purchase price 
this percentage reflects how well we expect our paper to perform  regardless of the underlying mix 
also included is a summary of our purchased receivable revenues by year of purchase  which provides additional vintage level detail of collections  net impairments or reversals and zero basis collections 
the primary factor in determining purchased receivable revenue is the irr assigned to the carrying value of portfolios 
when carrying balances go down or assigned irrs are lower than historical levels  revenue will generally be lower 
when carrying balances increase or assigned irrs go up  revenue will generally be higher 
purchased receivable revenue also depends on the amount of impairments or impairment reversals recognized 
when collections fall short of expectations or future expectations decline  impairments may be recognized in order to write down a portfolio s balance to reflect lower estimated total collections 
when collections exceed expectations or the future forecast improves  we may reverse previously recognized impairments or increase assigned irrs when there are no previous impairments to reverse 
zero basis collections are collections on portfolios that no longer have a carrying balance and therefore do not generate revenue by applying an assigned irr 
collections on these portfolios are recognized as purchased receivables revenue in the period collected 
portfolio performance the following table summarizes our historical portfolio purchase price and cash collections on an annual vintage basis by year of purchase as of december  year of purchase number of portfolios purchase price cash collections estimated remaining collections  total estimated collections total estimated collections as a percentage of purchase price in thousands total purchase price refers to the cash paid to a seller to acquire a portfolio less buybacks and the purchase price for accounts that were sold at the time of purchase to another debt purchaser 
estimated remaining collections are based in part on historical cash collections 
please refer to forward looking statements within item a 
risk factors on page and critical accounting policies on page for further information regarding these estimates 
estimated remaining collections refers to the sum of all future projected cash collections on our owned portfolios using up to an month collection forecast from the date of purchase 
estimated remaining collections for pools on the cost recovery method for revenue recognition purposes are equal to the carrying value 
there are no estimated remaining collections for pools on the cost recovery method that are fully amortized

the monthly yield is the weighted average yield determined by dividing purchased receivable revenues recognized in the period by the average of the beginning monthly carrying values of the purchased receivables for the period presented 
core amortization the table below shows components of revenue from purchased receivables  the amortization rate and the core amortization rate 
we use the core amortization rate to monitor performance of pools with remaining balances  and to determine if impairments  impairment reversals  or yield increases should be recorded 
core amortization trends may identify over or under performance compared to forecasts for pools with remaining balances 

table of contents the following factors contributed to the change in amortization rates from prior years total amortization was higher while the amortization rate declined for compared to prior years 
the decline in the amortization rate was the result of higher net impairment reversals and higher zero basis collections 
the increase in total amortization was primarily a result of higher average portfolio balances and collections 
portfolio balances that amortize too slowly in relation to current or expected collections may lead to impairments 
if portfolio balances amortize too quickly and we expect collections to continue to exceed expectations  previously recognized impairments may be reversed  or if there are no impairments to reverse  we may increase assigned yields  amortization of receivables balances for increased compared to prior years as a result of higher average balances of purchased receivables and higher collections on amortizing pools  net impairments are recorded as additional amortization  and increase the amortization rate  while net reversals have the opposite effect

table of contents cash collections the following tables provide further detailed vintage collection information on an annual and a cumulative basis historical collections in thousands year of purchase purchase price years ended december  pre total cumulative collections in thousands year of purchase purchase price total through december  cumulative collections as percentage of purchase price year of purchase purchase price total through december  does not include proceeds from sales of receivables 
purchase price refers to the cash paid to a seller to acquire a portfolio less buybacks and the purchase price for accounts that were sold at the time of purchase to another debt purchaser 

table of contents seasonality the success of our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
operating expenses are seasonally higher during the first and second quarters of the year due to expenses necessary to process the increase in cash collections 
operating expenses also may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our investment in court costs through our legal collection channel 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level  excluding the impact of impairments  due to the application of the interest method of revenue recognition 
in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of portfolios of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with initiating collection activities and integrating these receivables into our collection platform 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the following table summarizes our quarterly cash collections cash collections quarter amount amount amount amount amount first second third fourth total cash collections we segregate our collection operations into two primary channels  call center collections and legal collections 
our call center collections include our in house call center operations and third party collection agencies  including an agency in india 
our legal collections include our call centers  legal support staff  bankruptcy and probate teams and our legal forwarding network 
the following table illustrates cash collections and percentages by source years ended december  amount amount amount amount amount call center collections legal collections total cash collections certain cash collections have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the average collection payment size grew to during this increase reflects the net impact of a increase in the size of average call center collection payments and an increase of in the size of average legal payments when compared to the increase in call center payment size was a result of continued improvement in targeted collections strategies which we began to implement in the overall increase in the size of payments from the legal channel was due to continued improvements in our dialing and lettering strategies  increases in average garnishment payments and efficiencies provided by utilization of our proprietary collection platform 
the average payment size of collections grew to during this increase reflects the net impact of an increase in the size of average call center collection payments and a decrease of in the 
table of contents size of average legal payments when compared to the increase in call center payment size was a result of collections on paper with higher average balances coupled with a more effective training program  better utilization of our standardized collection methodology  and more targeted lettering and dialing strategies 
the overall decrease in the size of payments from the legal channel was influenced by improvements in our dialing and lettering strategies offset by negative trends in our ability to garnish assets 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of cash have been from operations and bank borrowings 
we have traditionally used cash for acquisitions of purchased receivables  repayment of bank borrowings  purchasing property and equipment and working capital to support growth 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with borrowings currently available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
in the future  if we need additional capital for investment in purchased receivables or working capital to grow our business or acquire other businesses  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or increase the availability under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders named therein  effective november  the credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we have a five year million revolving credit facility which expires in november the revolving credit facility  which may be limited by financial covenants  and a six year million term loan facility which expires in november the term loan facility and together with the revolving credit facility  the credit facilities 
the credit agreement replaced a similar credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  n 
a entered into during june the prior agreement allowed for a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility expiring in june and  respectively 
we incurred million in deferred financing costs and million of original issue discount related to the term loan facility as a result of entering into the new credit agreement 
we also incurred deferred financing costs of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  to amend the former credit agreement 
we expensed the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs related to the former term loan of million during the year ended december   which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the credit facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a base rate equal to the higher of a the federal funds rate plus  and b the prime commercial lending rate as set forth by the administrative agent s prime rate  plus an applicable margin which for the revolving credit facility  will range from to per annum based on the leverage ratio as defined  and for the term loan facility is  or a libor rate  not to be less than for the term loan facility  plus an applicable margin which for the revolving credit facility  will range from to per annum based on the leverage ratio  and for the term loan facility is 
the credit agreement includes an accordion loan feature that allows us to request an aggregate million increase in the revolving credit facility and or the term loan facility 
the credit facilities also include sublimits for million of letters of credit and for million of swingline loans which bear interest at the bank s alternative rate  which was at december  
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement also contains certain covenants and restrictions that we must comply with  which as of december  were leverage ratio as defined cannot exceed to at any time  and 
table of contents ratio of consolidated total liabilities as defined to consolidated tangible net worth as defined cannot exceed i to at any time prior to june   or ii to at any time thereafter  and ratio of cash collections as defined to estimated quarterly collections as defined must equal or exceed to for any fiscal quarter  and if not achieved  must then equal or exceed to for the following fiscal quarter for any period of two consecutive fiscal quarters 
the financial covenants may restrict our ability to borrow against the revolving credit facility 
at december   total available borrowings on the revolving credit facility were million  however  capacity to borrow under the terms of the financial covenants was limited to approximately million 
the limitation is based on the leverage ratio  which was the most restrictive financial covenant at december  borrowing capacity may be reduced under this ratio in the future if there are significant declines in cash collections or increases in operating expenses that are not offset by a reduction in outstanding borrowings 
the credit agreement contains a provision that requires us to repay excess cash flow as defined to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under the term loan facility 
the excess cash flow repayment provisions are of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  of the excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the leverage ratio was less than or equal to to but greater than to as of the end of such fiscal year  or if the leverage ratio is less than or equal to to as of the end of such fiscal year 
we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment based on the results of operations for the years ended december  and we made excess cash flow payments on the former term loan facility of million and million in march and  respectively  based on the provisions of the former credit agreement 
the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments over the term of the agreement  with the remaining principal balance due on the maturity date 
the following table details required repayment amounts year ending december  amount includes three quarterly principal payments with the remaining balance due on the maturity date 
voluntary prepayments are permitted on the term loan facility subject  in some cases  to certain breakfunding fees 
if a voluntary prepayment is made on or prior to november   we must pay a premium of of the amount prepaid  and if such prepayment is made after november  but on or before november   we must pay a prepayment premium of of the amount prepaid 
there are no premiums for voluntary prepayments made after november  commitment fees on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility are paid quarterly  in arrears  and are calculated as an amount equal to a margin of on the average amount available on the revolving credit facility 

table of contents the credit agreement requires us to effectively cap  collar or exchange interest rates on a notional amount of at least of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan facility 
this requirement is effective days after the effective date of the new credit agreement 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  derivative financial instruments and risk management  for additional information on our derivative financial instruments that satisfy this requirement 
outstanding borrowings on notes payable were as follows december  term loan facility revolving credit facility original issue discount on term loan total notes payable weighted average interest rate on total outstanding borrowings weighted average interest rate on revolving credit facility total outstanding borrowings in  net of the original issue discount on the term loan facility  increased by million 
the increase resulted from borrowings of million in order to fund upfront fees related to the new credit facilities and borrowings to fund higher portfolio purchases during the year 
the increase in interest rates and fee amortization resulting from the amended and restated credit agreement will have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately million in  if our borrowing levels remain consistent 
we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit agreement as of december  cash flows the majority of our cash flow requirements are for purchases of receivables and payment of operating expenses 
historically  these items have been funded with internal cash flow and with borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
for the year ended december   we invested million in purchased receivables primarily by using internal cash flow 
our cash balance increased from million at december  to million as of december  we also made net borrowings on our credit facilities of million during at december   we had the ability to increase the borrowings on our revolving credit facility by approximately million 
our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities is generated primarily from operating income earned through cash collections as adjusted for non cash items and the timing of payments of income taxes  timing of payments for accounts payable and changes to accrued liabilities 
we rely on cash generated from our operating activities and from the principal collected on our purchased receivables  included as a component of investing activities  to allow us to fund operations and re invest in purchased receivables 
cash provided by operations increased as a result of lower operating expenses and higher deferred income taxes 
we recorded net impairment reversals of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which resulted in negative non cash adjustments to net income when determining cash flow from operating activities 
in  we recorded million of net impairment charges  which was a positive non cash adjustment to net income when determining cash flow from operating activities 
declines in cash collections  if not offset by reductions in operating expenses  will decrease cash provided by operating activities in future periods 

table of contents investing activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in cash used by investing activities in is a result of million invested in purchased receivables in as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in purchasing has been partially offset by increases in principal collected on purchased receivables balances of million for  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we believe that we have sufficient capacity in our amended and restated credit facilities when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations to fund investment in purchased receivables at or above historical levels 
we acquired million  million and million in property and equipment in  and  respectively  primarily related to software and computer equipment for our collection platform and improvements to our telecommunications systems 
implementation of the collection platform has been funded through cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also acquired substantially all of the assets of our collection platform software provider during for million 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and used cash of million and million for and  respectively 
this was primarily due to net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility in of million  net of million of original issue discount  and repayments of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  we made payments for deferred financing costs of million associated with the new credit agreement in we also made payments for deferred financing costs of million and million in and  respectively  which were associated with amendments to the former credit agreement 
cash provided by financing activities would increase in future periods to the extent we use additional net borrowings on our revolving credit facility to fund purchases of paper 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as net income or loss plus a the provision for income taxes  b interest expense  c depreciation and amortization  d share based compensation  e gain or loss on sale of assets  net  f non cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets  g purchased receivables amortization  h loss on extinguishment of debt  and i in accordance with our credit agreement  certain ftc related charges  cash restructuring charges not to exceed million for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and the third party charge as defined in our credit agreement incurred during adjusted ebitda is not a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income prepared on a us gaap basis 
adjusted ebitda does not purport to represent cash flow provided by  or used in  operating activities as defined by us gaap  which is presented in our statements of cash flows 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest income  taxes  depreciation and amortization including purchased receivables amortization  and share based compensation  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry 

table of contents our management uses adjusted ebitda for planning purposes  including in the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and periodic forecasts  in communications with the board of directors  stockholders  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance  as a significant factor in determining bonuses under management s annual incentive compensation program  and as a measure of operating performance for the financial covenants in our amended credit agreement  because it provides information related to our ability to provide cash flows for investments in purchased receivables  capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the following table reconciles net income loss  the most directly comparable us gaap measure  to adjusted ebitda years ended december  net income loss adjustments income tax expense benefit interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt depreciation and amortization share based compensation gain on sale of assets  net non cash restructuring charges and impairment of assets purchased receivables amortization third party charge cash restructuring charges ftc related charges adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as reported for and has been restated to be consistent with the current presentation 
the definition of adjusted ebitda was updated during in order to be consistent with a similar definition in our amended and restated credit agreement 
the restatement increased the amounts previously disclosed by  and  for and  respectively 
we believe the revised definition of adjusted ebitda better matches the uses as described above 
collections  other revenue and operating expenses  net of the adjustment items  are the primary drivers of adjusted ebitda 
during  adjusted ebitda was million higher than this increase was a result of an increase in cash collections of million combined with a decrease in applicable operating expenses of million 
during  adjusted ebitda was million lower than this decline was primarily a result of a decline in cash collections of million offset in part by a decrease in applicable operating expenses of million 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of december  years ending december  thereafter operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations forward flow obligations revolving credit term loan contractual interest on derivative instruments total we have six forward flow contracts that have terms beyond december  with the last contract expiring in july to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our revolving credit facility  it would be due in november or earlier as defined in the credit agreement 
interest on our revolving credit facility is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  to the extent that a balance is outstanding on our term loan facility  it would be due in november the variable interest is not included within the amount outstanding as of december  we have a liability of million relating to uncertain tax positions  which has been excluded from the table above because the amount and fiscal year of the payment cannot be reliably estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generally account for our revenues from collections on purchased receivables by using the interest method in accordance with us gaap  which requires making reasonable estimates of the timing and amount of future cash collections 
application of the interest method requires the use of estimates  primarily estimated remaining collections  to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections  anticipated work effort and payer dynamics 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing from the remaining collections estimate  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
the estimates of remaining collections are sensitive to the inputs used and the performance of each pool 
performance is dependent on macro economic factors and the specific demographic makeup of the debtors in the pool 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected will have a favorable impact on revenue by allowing us to reverse previously recognized impairments or increase yields 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected will have an unfavorable impact and may result in impairments of receivables balances 
reductions in future collection estimates and impairments of purchased receivables balances put pressure on certain financial covenants in our credit facilities 

table of contents we use the cost recovery method when collections on a particular portfolio cannot be reasonably predicted 
the cost recovery method may be used for pools that previously had an irr assigned 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until we have fully collected the pool s balance 
we purchase pools of homogenous accounts receivable and record each pool at its acquisition cost 
pools purchased after may be aggregated into one or more static pools within each quarter  based on common risk characteristics 
risk characteristics of purchased receivables are generally assumed to be similar since purchased receivables are usually in the late stages of the post charged off collection cycle 
we therefore aggregate most pools purchased within each quarter 
each static pool  either aggregated or non aggregated  retains its own identity and does not change over the remainder of its life 
each static pool is accounted for as a single unit for recognition of revenue  principal payments and impairments 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess actual performance compared to expected performance 
this review includes an assessment of the actual results of cash collections  the work effort used and expected to be used in future periods  the components of the static pool including type of paper  the average age of purchased receivables  certain demographics and other factors that help us understand how a pool may perform in future periods 
generally  to the extent the differences in actual performance versus expected performance are favorable and the results of the review of pool demographics is also favorable  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
if the review of actual performance results in revised cash flow estimates that are less than the original estimates  and if the results of the review lead us to believe the decline in performance is not temporary  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
these periodic reviews  and any adjustments or impairments  are shared with our audit committee 
goodwill we periodically review the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment exists 
us gaap requires goodwill and certain intangible assets not subject to amortization be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step test 
the first step of the test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill is considered not impaired and the second step of the test is unnecessary 
if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the book value 
if the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
market capitalization was lower than book value at the time of the annual goodwill impairment test on november   and during other periods throughout as a result  we performed a step one analysis to assess the fair value of our single reporting unit 
the estimate of fair value of our goodwill reporting unit  the purchased receivables operating segment  is determined using various valuation techniques including market 
table of contents capitalization  which is a level input  and an analysis of discounted cash flows  which includes level inputs 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis  as of the testing date  which resulted in fair value in excess of book value by  which indicated goodwill was not impaired 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions including assumptions about future cash collections  revenues  cash flows  growth rates and discount rates which we base on our budget and long term plans 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the reporting unit  which we calculated to be 
a discount rate of was used in a similar discounted cash flow analysis performed during interim periods in the increase in the discount rate in the current test was a result of an increase in the equity market risk premium used  offset in part by a decrease in the expected risk free rate 
a basis point increase in the discount rate  or a decrease in cash flow of approximately million in each year of the analysis would have resulted in an excess of book value over fair value 
in order to corroborate the discounted cash flow results  we also prepared a market analysis to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit 
this market analysis took into consideration the fair value of our assets and liabilities utilizing our own assessment  and publicly available industry information on sale multiples 
this analysis also resulted in fair value in excess of book value and in excess of the results of the discounted cash flow analysis  which provided additional step one support that goodwill was not impaired 
in addition  we believe that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for our business that would adequately cover the difference between our market valuation and book value 
we performed a calculation of an implied control premium of our business  which supported the difference between the market valuation and book value 
based on the fair value calculations and the control premium reconciliation  we believe there was no impairment of goodwill as of november  no events occurred subsequent to the annual testing that would imply goodwill impairment exists  and therefore  additional testing was not performed 
the assessment of the fair value of goodwill will change in future periods based on a mix of the results of operations  changes in forecasted profitability and cash flows  assumptions used in our fair value models and other market factors that may change the risk inherent in the reporting unit  most importantly factors impacting our cost of equity and the regulatory environment 
we will continue to monitor these factors and related changes  which may require us to prepare an interim analysis prior to the next required annual assessment 
at december   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
if there is an impairment in future periods  all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill would be recorded as an impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
this charge would be a non cash event  and as such  would not have a material impact on our business  operations or ability to borrow on our credit facilities 
in addition  the non cash charge would not impact the covenants in our credit facilities or other contractual commitments 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be reversed 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be established and charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 

table of contents resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to the interest rate risk with our credit facilities 
accordingly  we may periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements for non trading purposes to modify the interest rate exposure associated with our outstanding debt 
the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities  not including the unamortized original issue discount on the term loan facility  were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
in september  we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement whereby  on a quarterly basis  we swap variable rates equal to three month libor for fixed rates on an original notional amount of million 
every year thereafter  on the anniversary of the swap agreement  the notional amount decreased by million 
the outstanding unhedged borrowings on our credit facilities were million as of december  interest rates on unhedged borrowings may be based on the prime rate or libor  at our discretion  however  libor based borrowings are subject to a floor 
assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on the unhedged borrowings  interest expense would have increased by approximately million for the year ended december   and by million for each of the years ended december  and on january   we entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement with a forward start date of march  on a quarterly basis  we will swap variable rates equal to three month libor  subject to the floor  for fixed rates 
the notional amount of the swap will be initially set at million 
in september  when the existing swap agreement expires  the notional amount of the new swap will increase to million and subsequently  will amortize in proportion to the required principle payments on the term loan facility through march when the notional amount will be million 
the new swap is expected to be highly effective in hedging against changes in variable interest rates 
the existing swap was determined to be highly effective in hedging against fluctuations in variable interest rates associated with the underlying debt when we entered into the agreement 
however  upon entering into the new credit agreement in november  the existing swap was de designated as a hedge because it was no longer expected to be highly effective in reducing the risk of changes in variable interest rates
