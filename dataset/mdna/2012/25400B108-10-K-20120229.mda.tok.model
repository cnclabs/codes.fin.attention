overview dg is the world s leading ad management and distribution platform 
dg helps advertisers engage with consumers across television and online media  while delivering timely and impactful ad campaigns 
our technology and high quality service help advertisers overcome the fragmentation in the market and get optimal results for their advertising spending 

table of contents during  we acquired two online digital advertising service businesses 
in july  we acquired mediamind technologies  inc mediamind for million and  in september we acquired the eyewonder advertising unit of limelight networks  inc for million 
as a result of these acquisitions  we reorganized our business into two distinct reportable segments  television and online 
our business can be impacted by several factors  including general economic conditions  the overall advertising market  new emerging digital technologies  the increasing trend towards delivering high definition hd data files  the emergence of online advertising  and the continued transition from the traditional dub and ship delivery method to digital broadcast signal transmission 
television segment our television segment s revenue is principally derived from delivering advertisements  syndicated programs  and video news releases from advertising agencies and other content providers to traditional broadcasters and other media outlets 
the television segment includes the operating results of our ads operation  sourceecreative  match point and mijo 
the majority of our television segment revenue results from the delivery of television and radio advertisements  or spots  which are typically delivered digitally but sometimes physically 
we generally bill our services on a per transaction basis 
we also offer a variety of other ancillary products that serve the television advertising industry 
these services include creative research  media production and duplication  management and storage of existing advertisements and broadcast verification 
this suite of innovative services addresses the needs of our customers at multiple stages along the value chain of advertisement creation and delivery in a cost effective manner and helps simplify the overall process of content delivery 
online segment our online segment s revenue is principally derived from services relating to online advertising 
we earn fees from our customers to create  execute  monitor and measure advertising campaigns on our platforms 
currently  we operate three separate online advertising platforms  unicast  which we acquired in  and our recent acquisitions of mediamind and eyewonder 
during  we plan to migrate all or substantially all of our eyewonder and unicast online advertising related business to the mediamind platform 
as a result of this planned migration  we expect to incur costs in integrating these businesses and subsequently realize certain operating synergies 
our mediamind platform offers an integrated campaign management solution that helps advertisers and agencies simplify the complexities of managing their advertising budgets across multiple digital media channels and formats  including online  mobile  rich media  in stream video  display and search 
mediamind provides our customers with an easy to use  end to end solution to enhance planning  creative  delivery  measurement and optimization of digital media campaigns 
our solutions are delivered through a scalable technology infrastructure that allows delivery of digital media advertising campaigns of any size 
in  we managed campaigns for customers in countries throughout north america  south america  europe  asia pacific  africa and the middle east 
acquisitions part of our business strategy is to acquire similar and or ancillary businesses that will increase our market penetration and  in some cases  result in operating synergies 
during the last two fiscal years  
table of contents we acquired four separate businesses involved in the distribution of media content 
those acquisitions are summarized as follows business acquired date of closing net assets acquired in millions segment eyewonder september  online mediamind july  online mijo april  television match point october  television each of the acquired businesses has been included in our results of operations since the date of closing 
political advertising our revenues are affected by political advertising  which peaks every other year consistent with the national  state and local election cycles in the united states 
highlights overall revenues increased million  or  from revenues from our online segment increased million  or  from  principally due to the acquisitions of mediamind and eyewonder during we reported million of acquisition and integration costs  compared to million in  in connection with the acquisitions of mediamind  eyewonder and mijo during we issued million of debt in connection with the acquisition of mediamind

table of contents costs in vs 
three months in  match point was acquired in october million and iii higher unicast costs million  largely attributable to an increase in related revenues 
cost of revenues also includes a million reduction  due to the reversal of a portion of an earnout liability that had been established in the match point purchase accounting 
the earnout liability was reduced when match point s revenues failed to reach the threshold necessary for an earnout payment 
the increase in our cost of revenues percentage is principally due to the acquisitions of match point and mijo  which have higher cost of revenue percentages than the balance of the company 
sales and marketing 
for  sales and marketing expense increased million  or  as compared to the increase was due to i the inclusion of mijo  mediamind and eyewonder million in our operating results and ii including twelve months of match point s expenses in vs

as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in  as compared to in the percentage increase is attributable to the inclusion of mediamind and eyewonder in our operating results as they have higher selling expenses than the balance of the company 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of revenue  will increase from historical levels as our online segment becomes a larger percentage of our total revenues 
research and development 
for  research and development costs increased million  or  as compared to the increase was due to the inclusion of mijo  mediamind and eyewonder million in our operating results

for  acquisition and integration expense increased million as compared to the increase was due to costs associated with the acquisitions and integration of mijo  mediamind and eyewonder 
depreciation and amortization 
for  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  as compared to the increase was due to additional depreciation and amortization associated with the assets of businesses acquired in million related to mijo  mediamind and eyewonder and million related to match point  partially offset by a reduction in depreciation of certain capitalized software projects that were fully depreciated during million 
we expect our depreciation and amortization expense will increase in as we have a full year of depreciation and amortization for the businesses acquired in interest expense 
for  interest expense increased million as compared to interest expense in was attributable to issuing million of term loans in connection with the acquisition of mediamind in july interest expense in was attributable to i borrowings on a prior credit facility until april when that credit facility was paid off  ii interest rate swap termination charges  and iii the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the prior credit facility 

table of contents interest income and other expense  net 
for  interest income and other expense  net decreased million as compared to the decrease was due to i the recognition of losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange rates primarily the israeli shekel and ii foreign currency exchange losses 
provision for income taxes

the provision for each period differs from the expected federal statutory rate of  as a result of certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to incurring million of acquisition and integration expenses in connection with our purchases of mediamind  eyewonder and mijo  a portion of which is not expected to be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
loss from discontinued operations 
discontinued operations relate to our springbox operating unit 
during the second quarter ended june   we made the decision to sell the principal assets and operations of springbox since it was not deemed to be part of our core business going forward

in  our hd revenue increased million million in compared to million in the amount includes million from mijo addressed above  which was mostly offset by a decrease in sd revenue million 
hd revenue increased due to a continuing trend of delivering more hd advertising content and less sd content 
we expect the percentage that hd deliveries bears to total deliveries will continue to increase 
both hd and sd revenue per delivery decreased due to the competitive environment and volume discounts 
hd revenue per delivery also decreased in as a result of a higher percentage of electronic deliveries in compared to in 
historically  electronic deliveries are priced lower than physical deliveries 
adjusted ebitda

table of contents adjusted ebitda 
for  adjusted ebitda improved to a million loss as compared to a million loss in our unicast business improved principally due to higher revenues million while keeping operating costs fairly constant 
non gaap financial measure in addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  we have historically provided additional financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with gaap non gaap 
legislative and regulatory changes discourage the use of and emphasis on non gaap financial measures and require companies to explain why non gaap financial measures are relevant to management and investors 
we believe that the inclusion of adjusted ebitda as a non gaap financial measure helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of our past performance and future prospects  consistent with how management measures and forecasts our performance  especially when comparing such results to previous periods or forecasts 
our management uses adjusted ebitda as a non gaap financial measure  in addition to gaap financial measures  as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods and to the performance of our competitors 
this measure is also used by management in its financial and operational decision making 
there are limitations associated with reliance on any non gaap financial measures because they are specific to our operations and financial performance  which makes comparisons with other companies financial results more challenging 
by providing both gaap and non gaap financial measures  we believe that investors are able to compare our gaap results to those of other companies  while also gaining a better understanding of our operating performance as evaluated by management 
we define adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations  before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  share based compensation  acquisition and integration expenses  restructuring impairment charges and benefits  and gains and losses on derivative instruments 
we consider adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance and a good measure of our historical operating trends 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations  such as net interest expense  acquisition and integration expenses  and gains and losses from derivative instruments  or do not require a cash outlay  such as share based compensation and impairment charges 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense  which is based on our estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset  are based on historical costs and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  our operating income  as well as other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measure in accordance with the requirements of regulation g issued by the sec  on page we are presenting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and reconciling the non gaap financial measure to the comparable gaap measure

in particular  cash and cash equivalents fluctuate with i operating results  ii the timing of payments  iii capital expenditures  iv acquisition and investment activity  v borrowings and repayments of debt  and vi capital activity 
the slight decrease in cash and cash equivalents during primarily relates to i cash used to purchase mediamind  eyewonder and mijo million  ii cash used to repurchase some of our shares million and iii cash used to purchase property and equipment million in excess of iv cash received from the issuance of debt million and v cash generated from operating activities million 
accounts receivable generally fluctuate with the level of revenues 
as revenues increase  accounts receivable tend to increase 
the number of days of revenue included in accounts receivable was and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the number of days of revenue outstanding is attributable to mediamind and eyewonder as they have longer collection periods for their receivables 
property and equipment tends to increase when we make significant improvements to our equipment  an expansion of our network or capitalized software development initiatives 
it also can increase as a result of acquisition activity 
further  the balance of property and equipment is affected by recording depreciation expense

in  we generated million in cash from operating activities  as compared to million in and million in for  the decrease was largely due to lower net income partially as a result of incurring acquisition and integration expenses of million 
for  the increase was largely driven by our improved operating results 
historically  we have invested our cash in i property and equipment  ii the development of software  iii strategic investments and iv the acquisition of complementary businesses 
during the last two fiscal years  we have acquired four businesses 
cash is obtained from financing activities principally as a result of issuing debt and equity instruments 
we use cash in financing activities principally in the repayment of debt and purchase of treasury stock 

table of contents sources of liquidity our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents on hand including about million held outside the united states at year end which can be repatriated into the united states with little or no adverse tax consequences  short term investments  cash generated from operating activities  borrowings from our existing or any new credit facility  and the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand 
historically  we have generated significant amounts of cash from operating activities 
we expect this trend will continue 
we have the ability to issue equity instruments 
as of december   we had two effective shelf registration statements on file with the sec for the issuance of i up to a total of million shares of our common stock and ii up to million of preferred stock 
in july  we issued million of term loans under our amended credit facility  net of an original issue discount of million 
the net proceeds were used to acquire mediamind 
our amended credit facility also allows us to borrow up to million of revolving loans  none of which were outstanding at december  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
in april  we issued million shares of our common stock under a shelf registration statement that resulted in us receiving approximately million of net proceeds 
we used a portion of the proceeds to repay all of our then outstanding debt 
we believe our sources of liquidity  including i cash and cash equivalents on hand  ii our million revolving credit facility  and iii cash generated from operating and financing activities  will satisfy our capital needs for the next months 
cash requirements we expect to use cash in connection with the purchase of capital assets  the repayment of our debt  the purchase of our common stock  the organic growth of our business  and the strategic acquisition of media related businesses 
during  we expect we will purchase property and equipment and incur capitalized software development costs ranging from to million including million to million related to a new year office lease in new york city 
we expect to use cash to further expand and develop our business 
while we presently have no definitive plans  we may seek to acquire or merge with another company that we believe would be in the best interest of our shareholders 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
goodwill 
we have three reporting units  television  online and sourceecreative sourcee 
each of our reporting units have goodwill 
on an annual basis  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  we test for goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or other methods of valuation including the guideline public company method 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on our long term projections by reporting unit 
the discount rate used reflects the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if not  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  a write down of the reporting unit s goodwill would be necessary 
we did not recognize a goodwill impairment loss for  or at december   the fair value of the television  online and sourcee reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately  and  respectively 
the fair value of our online reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value at december  our online reporting unit has about million of goodwill 
if actual or expected future cash flows of our online reporting unit should fall sufficiently below our current forecasts  we may be required to record an impairment charge on the online reporting unit s goodwill 
future net cash flows are impacted by a variety of factors including revenues  operating margins  income tax rates  discount rates  economic conditions and industry trends 
further  our market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium is an indicator of the total value of our company 
at year end  our market capitalization was below our total stockholders equity  which is an indicator of goodwill impairment 
if our market capitalization should stay at the year end level or deteriorate for an extended period of time  it would likely result in us recording a goodwill impairment charge in the future 
business combinations 
we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
determining the nature of identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows of the acquired entity 
the value assigned to a specific asset or liability  and the period over which an asset is depreciated or amortized can impact future earnings 
some of the more significant estimates made in business combinations relate to the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships and trade names  and the period over which these assets are amortized 
further  we sometimes agree to contingent consideration arrangements based on the acquired entity s future operating results 
valuing contingent consideration obligations requires us to make significant estimates about future results 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets principally relate to acquired identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships and trade names  and property and equipment  including capitalized internally developed software and network equipment 
in determining whether long lived assets are impaired  the accounting rules do not provide for an annual impairment test 
instead they require that a triggering event occur before testing an asset for impairment 
triggering events include poor operating performance  significant negative trends and significant changes in the use of such assets 
once a triggering event has occurred  an impairment test is employed based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or hold the asset for sale 
if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use  first a comparison of projected undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  the asset would be written down to its fair value 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
if the intent is to hold the asset for sale  then to the extent the asset s carrying value is greater than its fair value less selling costs  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the most significant assumption relates to the projection of future cash flows 
we also evaluate the estimated useful life of long lived assets reviewed for impairment 
in and  we recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to our springbox unit reported in discontinued operations primarily related to the customer relationships intangible asset 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we did not recognize an impairment loss related to long lived assets 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise as a result of temporary differences between amounts recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and amounts recognized for federal  foreign and state income tax purposes 
we have both deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss nol carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities relate primarily to intangible assets  such as customer relationships and trade names  some of which have little or no tax basis 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets if a determination is made that their ultimate realization is not likely 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments  which generally relate to whether an acquired operation will generate future taxable income 
we did not recognize any valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets for the years ended december   or  nor do we presently foresee any such valuation allowances 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from i the distribution of digital and analog video and audio media content  ii volume based fees for using our online ad serving platforms  iii media research resources  and iv support and other services 
we recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
below are descriptions of our services and other offerings  and generally the triggering point of revenue recognition  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our services revenue from the digital distribution of video and audio advertising content in our television segment generally is billed based on a rate per transmission  and we recognize revenue for these services upon notification that the advertising content was received at the broadcast destination

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the market value of financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk historically  we have provided limited services to entities located outside the united states and  therefore  our exchange rate gains and losses have not been material 
however  in april  we acquired mijo with substantially all of its operations conducted in canada 
in july  we acquired mediamind with the majority of its operations conducted outside the united states 
further  in september  we acquired eyewonder with a portion of its operations conducted outside the united states 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
in order to limit our foreign currency transaction gains and losses  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of the substantial increase in our foreign operations  we expect to experience foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses in the future  somewhat mitigated by our foreign currency hedging programs 
in  about of our consolidated revenue was attributable to foreign jurisdictions 
while the percentage of foreign sourced revenue as compared to consolidated revenue is increasing  not all of such revenue is subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gain or loss as some of our foreign operations use the us dollar as their functional currency eg israel and generally invoice customers in us dollars 
interest rate risk in july  we borrowed million of term loans in connection with our acquisition of mediamind 
the term loans bear interest at the greater of i libor plus or ii per annum 
to the extent libor exceeds per annum day libor was about at december   our interest expense and payments will increase absent an interest rate hedging arrangement
