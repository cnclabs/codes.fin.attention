item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k 
the discussion under the subheading review of operating segments below is in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year unless otherwise indicated 
company management considers local currency change to be an important measure because by excluding the impact of volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume change is clearer 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the company utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial information as well as to quantify the impact of various significant factors that contribute to the changes in the company s periodic results included in the discussion below 
forward looking statements and risk factors the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are those that address activities  events or developments that the company or management intends  expects  projects  believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future 
all statements regarding future performance  earnings projections  earnings guidance  management s expectations about its future cash needs and effective tax rate  and other future events or developments are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are based on management s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other relevant factors 
they are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ materially from those envisaged by the company s forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in part i item a 
risk factors in this form k 
the company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure and undertakes no obligation to update them  whether as a result of new information  future developments or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions the company may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses the company s critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding the company s accounting policies 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and appropriate segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which a final determination is made 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of the future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while company management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company performs impairment testing for goodwill at least annually during the company s fiscal third quarter  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
the company s two reportable operating segments  life sciences and industrial  are also deemed to be its reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  the overall fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the event that the overall fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the overall fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of march  and march  the estimated fair values of both the life sciences and industrial reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units  and as such  step two was not performed 
when testing for impairment  the company uses significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair values of its reporting units 
fair value of the company s reporting units is determined using market multiples derived from trailing twelve month revenue  earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  of publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the company s reporting units 
these various market multiples are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to determine a range of fair values for the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting units for the purposes of the goodwill impairment test is then determined using the average of the fair values derived from the minimum and median market multiples 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
to further substantiate the reasonableness of the fair value of its reporting units  the company compares enterprise value outstanding shares multiplied by the closing market price per share  plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents to the aggregate fair value of its reporting units 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled  except for certain long term contracts  whereby revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method see below 
transfer of title and risk of loss occurs when the product is delivered in accordance with the contractual shipping terms 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i the company has previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts company management evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  company management records in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the factors used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the company s expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when company management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
company management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether company management intends to retain the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
defined benefit retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense and pension assets liabilities recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with the company s defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately  the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
this is under the premise that cash flows for benefits due in a particular year can be theoretically settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies company management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
market reorganization effective in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company reorganized its industrial markets 
the machinery equipment submarket previously part of the aeropower market and energy water are now combined and are reported as the process technologies market 
with the exclusion of machinery equipment from aeropower  aerospace is now the stand alone descriptor for that part of the business 
sales information by market for prior periods has been restated to reflect these changes 
all discussions and amounts reported in this filing are based on the reorganized structure 
discontinued operations on april   the company entered into an asset purchase agreement apa to sell certain assets of its blood collection  filtration and processing product line the product line to haemonetics corporation haemonetics for approximately  the transaction involved the transfer of manufacturing facilities and equipment in covina  california  tijuana  mexico  ascoli  italy and a portion of the company s operations in fajardo  puerto rico 
the sale closed on august   and approximately  employees transitioned to haemonetics at that time 
in addition to the manufacturing facilities and related equipment  the company transferred product line related inventory and intangible assets 
haemonetics also assumed certain employee related liabilities 
separate from these manufacturing facilities  the company also agreed to transfer related blood media manufacturing capabilities and assets to haemonetics 
the transfer of the related media manufacturing lines is expected to be completed by calendar year until that time  the company will provide these media products under a supply agreement 
under the terms of the apa  approximately  was paid upon closing  with the balance of the purchase price payable upon the company s delivery of the aforementioned blood media manufacturing capability and related assets 
final determination of cash proceeds  gain on sale and tax impact are subject to working capital and certain other adjustments and final allocation of proceeds by jurisdiction 
the product line  which was a component of the company s life sciences segment  met the criteria for discontinued operations and held for sale presentation during the third quarter of fiscal year as such  it has been reported as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company did not allocate any portion of the company s interest expense to discontinued operations 
furthermore  life sciences and industrial segment profit have been restated to reflect a change in the allocation of certain shared expenses on a continuing operations basis 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results from continuing operations sales in fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates used to translate foreign subsidiary results into us dollars reduced reported sales by  primarily related to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against the the japanese yen jpy and the chinese renminbi 
in local currency  sales increased 
life sciences segment sales increased in local currency  while industrial segment sales grew in local currency 
for a detailed discussion of sales by segment  refer to the section review of operating segments results from continuing operations below 
consumable filtration products sales including appurtenant hardware increased in local currency reflecting growth of in life sciences and in industrial

systems sales represented of total sales in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year sales in emerging markets grew approximately in fiscal year  and represented approximately of total sales 
emerging markets are defined as high growth and or developing areas of the world in which the company has focused growth resources 
in the americas  emerging markets include latin america  primarily the countries of brazil  argentina and mexico 
in europe  emerging markets include eastern european countries  primarily russia  turkey and poland  as well as various countries in the middle east and africa 
in asia  emerging markets primarily include the countries of china  india  philippines  indonesia and vietnam 
gross margin in fiscal year increased basis points to from in fiscal year this reflects an increase in gross margin in the life sciences and industrial segments of basis points and basis points  respectively 
for a detailed discussion of the factors impacting gross margin by segment  refer to the section review of operating segments results from continuing operations below 
the company has risks to gross margin from the fluctuation of the costs of products that are sourced in a currency different than the currency they are sold in transactional impact 
with the company s current manufacturing footprint  a significant portion of products purchased by the company in the eurozone are sourced outside of the eurozone 
sales in the eurozone are approximately of total company sales 
about of the cost of goods on those sales are denominated in british pounds or us dollars 
the company currently estimates that the transactional impact of a fluctuation in the us dollar or the british pound relationship to the euro would impact the company s consolidated gross margin by a range of approximately basis points on an annualized basis 
on average  in fiscal year  the euro was against the us dollar and was against the british pound  which was a and depreciation  respectively  compared to the average rates in fiscal year the average euro rate in the first half of fiscal year was stronger when compared to the first half of fiscal year  however  this was more than offset by a weakening of the euro in the second half of fiscal year when compared to the second half of fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal year increased by  or approximately  or  in local currency 
these increases are reflected in both segments and in the corporate services group 
selling expenses increased about  while general and administrative g a expenses increased approximately 
in addition to inflationary increases in payroll and related costs affecting both selling and g a expenses  the overall increase in sg a in local currency year over year primarily reflects project related costs in information technology  including incremental costs incurred as the company concluded the last significant phase of its global erp system implementation  increased expenses driven by resource deployment related to regional expansion in latin america including incremental costs related to an acquisition in brazil selling and g a  impacting both segments  middle east and asia  impacting both segments  incremental costs related to the acquisition of fortebio selling and g a  impacting life sciences  and costs related to bringing industrial into the european and asian hubs 
these increases were partly offset by savings realized from the company s cost reduction programs

in fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring and other charges rotc of  primarily comprised of severance  professional fees and other costs related to the company s structural cost improvement initiatives  as well as charges related to certain employment contract obligations 
such costs were partly offset by the gain on sale of assets 
the company is targeting to achieve million in structural cost improvements over the next three fiscal years  and expects to accomplish approximately of this in fiscal year the cash outflow related to the costs to implement the structural cost improvements are estimated to be approximately million in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recorded rotc of  primarily comprised of severance  professional fees and other costs related to the company s cost reduction initiatives 
furthermore  rotc includes costs related to certain employment contract obligations and an increase to previously established environmental reserves 
these costs were partly offset by the receipt of insurance claim payments 
the severance costs recorded in fiscal year relate to the closure of a manufacturing facility 
the details of rotc for the years ended july  and july  as well as the activity related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in those years can be found in note  restructuring and other charges  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit were  in fiscal year  essentially flat compared to  in fiscal year the year over year comparison of ebit was negatively impacted by the increase in rotc as discussed above 
the impact of foreign currency translation had an immaterial impact on ebit in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  ebit were compared to in fiscal year net interest expense in fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year net interest expense in fiscal year reflects the reversal of  of accrued interest primarily related to the resolution of us tax audits 
net interest expense in fiscal year reflects the net reversal of  of accrued interest primarily related to the resolution of us tax audits  partially offset by an interest accrual related to foreign tax matters 
excluding these items  net interest expense decreased compared to fiscal year the company s effective tax rate for fiscal years and was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a us tax audit partly offset by tax costs associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings and the establishment of the company s asian headquarters in singapore 
excluding these impacts  as well as the impacts of rotc and interest discussed above  the effective tax rate for fiscal years and would have been and  respectively

these transactions include non functional currency intercompany and external sales as well as intercompany and external purchases 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts  matching the notional amounts and durations of the receivables and payables resulting from the aforementioned underlying foreign currency transactions  to mitigate the exposure to earnings and cash flows caused by changing foreign exchange rates 
in addition to the balance sheet related mitigation activities  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company began to use foreign exchange forward contracts for cash flow hedging of its forecasted transactional exposure to the euro due to changes in the market rates to exchange euros for british pounds 
the risk management objective of holding foreign exchange derivatives is to mitigate volatility to earnings and cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the year ended july  was  the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of july  was  of which  are for cash flow hedges that cover monthly transactional exposures through july the company s foreign currency balance sheet exposures resulted in the recognition of a loss within sg a of approximately  in the year ended july   before the impact of the measures described above

adoption of new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this guidance amends united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this includes clarification of the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
in addition  to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions  some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way for example  using the word shall rather than should to describe the requirements in us gaap 
this amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and was effective for the company beginning with its third quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december   which for the company is the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect this guidance will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to defer indefinitely a requirement in the june standard that called for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to be measured and presented by income statement line item in net income and also in other comprehensive income 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the adoption of this disclosure only guidance will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial results and is effective for the company beginning with its first quarter of fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
because the company operates through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  its earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
company management estimates that foreign exchange translation had less than a cent impact on earnings per share in fiscal year most of the company s products are manufactured in the us  puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the euro  the japanese yen the yen  the british pound the pound  the australian dollar  the brazilian real  the canadian dollar  the swiss franc and the singapore dollar  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
in fiscal year  the euro  pound  brazilian real and canadian dollar  weakened by approximately   and  respectively  against the us dollar and the yen  australian dollar  swiss franc and singapore dollar strengthened by approximately   and  respectively  against the us dollar  compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro weakened against the pound by approximately 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
one component of this exposure relates to short term transaction exposures of primarily yen  euro  pound and swiss franc denominated receivables and payables 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by opening forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
at july   the net balance sheet exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by net forward contracts with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates as of july   net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
in addition to these balance sheet related mitigation activities  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company began to use forwards for cash flow hedging on its forecasted transactional exposure to the euro due to changes in market rates to exchange euros for pounds 
the hedges cover a british subsidiary pound functional currency with euro revenues and a swiss subsidiary with a euro functional currency with pound expenses 
the probability of the occurrence of these transactions is high and the company s assessment is based on observable facts  including the frequency and amounts of similar past transactions 
the objective of the cash flow hedges is to lock in the forecasted impact of the pound equivalent amount of euro sales for the british subsidiary and the euro equivalent amount of pound expenses for the swiss subsidiary  at the agreed upon exchange rates in the forwards 
the notional amount of forwards outstanding as of july  was  and cover monthly transactional exposures through july the company does not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
interest rates the company currently has offsetting exposures with respect to changes in interest rates 
this is primarily due to the company s variable rate positions on debt and accrued liabilities compared to the company s variable rate positions on cash and retirement benefit assets 
the company s debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  the company s cash position was variable rate at july  and july  for the year ended july   interest expense on variable rate debt and accrued liabilities was  and interest income on variable rate cash and retirement benefit assets was  a hypothetical shift in market interest rates for fiscal year eg  if an assumed market interest rate of increased to could have an adverse affect on interest  net of approximately
