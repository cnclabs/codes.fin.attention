forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  our ability to quickly increase capacity in response to an increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing devices to the safety market  and other factors referenced in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products into the marketplace since safety syringes comprised of our sales in we also manufacture and market the blood collection tube holder and the iv safety catheter 
we currently provide other safety medical products in addition to safety products utilizing retractable technology 
one such product is the patient safe syringe  which is uniquely designed to reduce the risk of bloodstream infections resulting from catheter hub contamination 
historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
in  we had a contract to provide dhhs with syringes to be used in the us efforts to provide swine flu vaccinations 
this contract was material for and affects comparability to financial data 
our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally and internationally through numerous distributors 
although we have made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care market  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices 
the alternative care market is composed of alternate care facilities that provide long term nursing and out patient surgery  emergency care  and physician services 
the fact that our progress is limited is principally due to exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd  the dominant maker and seller of disposable syringes and other needle products  which practices have blocked us from access to the market 
a suit against bd is currently pending alleging violations of state and federal antitrust acts and false advertising 
bd has ceased marketing the infringing ml integra syringe 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and the cash provided by the litigation settlements and generated from operations becomes insufficient  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of 
table of contents workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
we took such actions at the end of the second quarter of salary reductions put in place in the second quarter of remain in place 
we are bringing additional molding operations to little elm as a cost saving measure 
the addition of four molding machines in is part of that endeavor 
we continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
effective july   we entered into a settlement agreement with abbott and hospira 
in connection with this settlement agreement  we granted hospira an exclusive one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of our patient safe syringe 
this option expired unexercised in july we have received the total million option payment 
as part of the settlement  in the third quarter of  hospira paid us million and forgave a marketing fee of million 
the settlement was reduced by an outstanding invoice due to us for thousand 
in the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with our counsel  locke lord llp  regarding future litigation expenditures that caps certain of our litigation costs in exchange for a contingent fee interest 
we believe this agreement serves both our short term and long term interests and will reduce the legal fee component of our general and administrative costs and will continue to impact our cash flow in a positive manner 
on september   we commenced the exchange offer 
as of november   the expiration date of the exchange offer  preferred stockholders had tendered the following number of shares of preferred stock  shares of series i preferred stock   shares of series ii preferred stock  no shares of series iii preferred stock were exchanged   shares of series iv preferred stock  and  shares of series v preferred stock 
a total of  and  shares of common stock were issued as consideration to participating preferred stockholders pursuant to the exchange offer 
in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer  participating preferred stockholders agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with their tendered preferred stock  which resulted in a waiver of a total of  in unpaid dividends in arrears 
as of december   we engaged in private sales with three preferred stockholders which tendered the following number of shares of preferred stock  shares of series i preferred stock   shares of series iv preferred stock  and  shares of series v preferred stock 
a total of  and  shares of common stock were issued as consideration to the three preferred stockholders 
in accordance with the terms of the private sales  the three preferred stockholders agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with their tendered preferred stock  which resulted in a waiver of a total of  in unpaid dividends in arrears 
product purchases from double dove  a chinese manufacturer  have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and have provided a competitive manufacturing cost 
in  double dove manufactured approximately of the units we produced 
we believe we could make up any long term disruption in these purchases by utilizing more of the capacity at the little elm facility  except for the ml insulin syringe  the ml and ml syringes  and the autodisable syringe which altogether comprised about of our revenues 
with increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have generally tended to decline 
factors that could affect our unit costs include increases in costs by third party manufacturers  changing production volumes  costs of petroleum products  and transportation costs 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december   or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading

the provision for income taxes consists principally of thousand of state and local income taxes and a credit to federal income tax of thousand 
cash flow from operations was million for due principally to litigation settlements  a reduction in accounts receivable balances and inventories 
a decrease in accrued liabilities and net income  mitigated the increase in cash flow

domestic unit sales decreased and average sales prices increased 
international unit sales increased and average international selling prices increased

additional reductions in expenses in as compared to include reductions of thousand for consulting  thousand in k expense  and thousand for marketing expense 
in  we recognized impairment charges of thousand for costs associated with research and development activities compared to impairment charges of million in associated with catheter production equipment 
operating loss was million in compared to an operating loss in of million 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates 
interest expense increased due to higher average loan balances and a reduction in capitalized interest 

table of contents litigation settlements  net reflects cash proceeds of million from hospira and a waiver of million in marketing fees payable to abbott 
a receivable from abbott for thousand was also waived 
royalties of  were paid as a result of the settlement 
benefit for income taxes consists principally of additional refunds due for our federal tax return reduced by thousand due in alternative minimum tax for cash flow from operations was million for due principally to litigation settlements and improved results from operations 
liquidity at the present time  management does not intend to raise equity capital 
due to the funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
our cash position has improved million  or  over the improvement is related to cash provided by operations  including litigation proceeds  reduced by the purchase of our preferred stock 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from the proceeds from revenues  private placements  litigation settlements  and loans 
internal sources of liquidity margins and market access to routinely achieve break even quarters  we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second antitrust lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology  the introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of our products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
the mix of domestic and international sales affects the average sales price of our products 
generally  the higher the ratio of domestic sales to international sales  the higher the average sales price will be 
typically international sales are shipped directly from china to the customer 
purchases of product manufactured in china  if available  usually decrease the average cost of manufacture for all units 
domestic costs  such as indirect labor and overhead  remain relatively constant 
the number of units produced by us versus manufactured in china can have a significant effect on the carrying costs of inventory as well as cost of sales 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate mix of products manufactured domestically and those manufactured in china to achieve economic benefits as well as to maintain our domestic manufacturing capability 
fluctuations in the cost of oil since our products are petroleum based and transportation and the volume of units purchased from double dove may have an impact on the unit costs of our product 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
reductions in oil prices may not quickly affect petroleum product prices 

table of contents seasonality historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
in  we had a contract to provide dhhs with syringes to be used in the us efforts to provide swine flu vaccinations 
this contract was material for and affects comparability to financial data 
cash requirements due to funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations becomes insufficient to support operations  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans from our inception  which have  together with the proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation efforts  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
given the current economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional funds through loans is uncertain 
furthermore  the shareholders previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c preferred stock that could  if necessary  be designated and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
due to the current market price of our common stock  it is unlikely we would choose to raise funds by the sale of equity 
effective july   we entered into a settlement agreement with abbott and hospira 
in connection with this settlement agreement  we granted hospira an exclusive one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of our patient safe syringe 
this option expired unexercised in july we have received the total million option payment 
as part of the settlement  in the third quarter of  hospira paid us million and forgave a marketing fee of million 
the settlement was reduced by an outstanding invoice due to us for thousand 
capital resources repurchase of preferred shares on september   we commenced an offer to purchase all outstanding class b convertible preferred stock the preferred stock for cash and common stock the exchange offer 
as of november   the expiration date of the exchange offer  preferred stockholders had tendered a total of  shares of preferred stock 
a total of  and  shares of common stock were issued as consideration to participating preferred stockholders pursuant to the exchange offer 
in accordance with the terms of the exchange offer  participating preferred stockholders agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with their tendered preferred stock  which resulted in a waiver of a total of  in unpaid dividends in arrears 
during the quarter ended december   we engaged in private sales with three preferred stockholders which tendered a total of  shares of preferred stock 
a total of  and  shares of common stock were issued as consideration to the three preferred stockholders 
in accordance with the terms of the private sales  the three preferred stockholders agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with their tendered preferred stock  which resulted in a waiver of a total of  in unpaid dividends in arrears 
material commitments for expenditures in  we purchased molding machines to expand our in house molding capability and further reduce costs 
financing was completed in the second quarter of for three molding machines in the amount of  the purchase and financing for a fourth molding machine for  was completed in the fourth quarter of trends in capital resources off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
table of contents the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations note long term debt operating leases total these amounts do not reflect the effect of the beneficial conversion feature of the note payable to katie petroleum and  therefore  will be greater than the amounts in the financial statements 
significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
we require certain distributors to make a prepayment prior to beginning production or shipment of their order 
distributors may apply such prepayments to their outstanding invoices or pay the invoice and continue to carryforward the deposit for future orders 
such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheets and are shown in note  other accrued liabilities 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been immaterial 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
under certain contracts  revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
distributors receive a rebate for the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the appropriate contract price as reflected on a tracking report provided by the distributor to us 
if product is sold by a distributor to an entity that has no contract  there is a standard rebate lower than a contracted rebate given to the distributor 
one of the purposes of the rebate is to encourage distributors to submit tracking reports to us 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against the individual distributor s accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or 
table of contents accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 
certain distributors have taken rebates to which they are not entitled  such as utilizing a rebate for products not purchased directly from us 
we have been in discussions with the principal customers that claimed non contractual rebates 
major customers said they have ceased the practices resulting in claiming non contractual rebates 
rebates can only be claimed on purchases made directly from us 
we have established a reserve for the collectability of these non contractual rebate amounts 
the expense for the reserve is recorded in operating expense  general and administrative 
the reserve for such non contractual deductions is a reduction of accounts receivable 
our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product 
our domestic return policy also generally provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by us 
our international distribution agreements do not provide for any returns 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using actual average cost 
we compare the average cost to the market price and record the lower value 
management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time to sell such inventory  the shelf life of inventory  and current market conditions when determining excess or obsolete inventories 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories or they may be written off 
marketing fees in prior periods  marketing fees payable to abbott were included in current liabilities in the balance sheets 
in connection with the settlement with abbott  marketing fees payable recorded in previous periods will not have to be paid 
the reversal of this accrual is included in litigation settlements  net on the statements of operations in recent pronouncement in june  fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
fasb asu no 
amends existing guidance by allowing two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous financial statement a statement of income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income 
also  items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements 
asu no 
requires retrospective application  and it is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
we shifted the bulk of our funds into us treasury bills and other us government backed securities in april additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material changes in near term earnings
