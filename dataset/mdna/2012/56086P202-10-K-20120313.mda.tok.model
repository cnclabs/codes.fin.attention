item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview makemusic s mission is to develop and market solutions that transform how music is composed  taught  learned and performed 
this is accomplished by providing integrated technology  content and web services to enhance and expand how music is taught  learned and prepared for performance 
providing music education content developers with a technology enriched publishing platform that leverages their copyrighted assets while simultaneously increasing the content and value of the smartmusic library 
offering software solutions for engraving and electronically distributing sheet music 
makemusic develops and markets two product lines  smartmusic learning software for band  jazz ensemble  orchestra and voice and music notation software including finale  musicxml and garritan sound libraries 
we believe these innovative products reinforce each other s features and competitiveness and will allow us to continue to achieve positive operating results 
the well established finale family of music notation software products is utilized by music colleges and composers around the world in the creation of music scores 
finale serves a large and stable customer base and generates consistent revenue through sales of new version releases 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the acquisition of select assets of recordare  llc and the acquisition of garritan corporation 
we believe these acquisitions provide new products  technology  brands and employees that are complementary to makemusic and provide growth opportunities for the future 
our fiscal year resulted in a slight decline in sales for makemusic 
overall  net revenue decreased compared to smartmusic revenue grew due to our year over year subscription growth from  to  and price increases implemented in the third quarter of  from to for teacher subscriptions and from to for student subscriptions 
notation revenue decreased due to reductions in both our sales to distribution partners and our direct sales 
we attribute these decreases to the timing of our annual finale update release 
this year s update was released in october  as compared to last year s release of finale in june gross margin percentages were comparable at in and in acquisitions in the fourth quarter of did not have a significant impact on sales and operating results due to their timing 
operating expenses increased in  due to increased selling and marketing expenses as a result of the planned expansion of our direct sales force 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to recruiting initiatives for our chief executive officer position  which was completed with the appointment of karen van lith on june   severance expenses relating to the departure of our former interim chief executive officer and an increase in legal and accounting expenses relating to the purchase of garritan corporation and select assets of recordare  llc in the fourth quarter of we also incurred expenses of approximately  relating to a patent infringement settlement  which were accrued in the first quarter of and paid in the second quarter of development expenses were lower in primarily because our open chief technology officer position and other open development positions resulted in lower personnel costs 
the chief technology officer position was filled in august with the appointment of paul carlson and open development positions were filled in the third and fourth quarters of our net income before taxes in was  compared to  in additionally  we reported tax expense of  in and a tax benefit in of  as a result of the factors mentioned  we reported net income of approximately  in compared to net income of  in we believe there is growth potential with smartmusic  a subscription based product directed toward the very large and constantly renewing market of music students and music teachers 
smartmusic combines a software application with a library of thousands of music titles and skill development exercises 
it provides students and musicians with a compelling practice or audition experience and music teachers with the efficiency and effectiveness to reach more students and assess student achievement and growth 

table of contents smartmusic software enhances and transforms the hours spent practicing and makes it more engaging  causing students to practice longer and more often 
smartmusic provides access to an ever increasing library of band  jazz ensemble and orchestra literature 
each title includes individual part assignments thereby providing music teachers with a time saving solution for preparing selections for their next performance 
smartmusic also offers a rich variety of effective practice tools that make practice time more efficient and productive 
the combination of making practice time more engaging and productive leads to rapid student skill development  increased student confidence  higher student retention  and stronger music programs 
smartmusic introduced new vocal and site reading technology and included site singing exercises which can be assessed for both pitch and rhythm 
choral directors and general music teachers now have access to the same award winning interactive technology that has been available to band and orchestra directors 
teachers use the smartmusic gradebook capability of the educator s subscription to issue assignments to students  receive completed assignments from students  assess student achievement and manage student records 
this provides music educators and students with exciting new possibilities to assist in developing strong music programs and complying with accountability requirements 
in july of  we released a mobile application called smartmusic inbox tm 
smartmusic inbox is a free application for both android and ios platforms for mobile use by smartmusic teachers enabling them to listen and grade assignments with ease and mobility 
we believe that our technological investments in smartmusic have created a digital pipeline between our growing subscriber base of more than  and the music publishers who provide smartmusic content 
this growing platform is a strategic asset for makemusic 
the following table illustrates our quarterly smartmusic metrics dec mar jun sep dec total subscriptions subscriptions purchased during quarter educator accounts our educational sales organization focuses on direct school district sales aimed at the  schools who match our ideal demographic profile 
we increased the size of our educational sales force from to and our marketing staff from to in to strengthen our strategic sales and marketing initiatives 
during  we further increased our education sales force to we intend to hire a sales executive in early to lead our sales and business development initiatives 

table of contents the following table illustrates the total net new smartmusic educator subscriptions for each quarter during the years ended december  and december  educators quarter end date beginning subscriptions new subscriptions renewed subscriptions renewal rate subscriptions ended quarter end subscriptions quarterly net new subscriptions we define renewed subscriptions as those subscriptions that educators purchase within the two month period after their prior subscription ended 
because of changes to the start of school from year to year  fluctuations in the date that music teachers implement their curriculum  and promotional programs that encourage early renewals  the majority of subscribers renew their subscriptions within approximately a two month window of the anniversary date of their previous subscription rather than exactly on the anniversary date 
as a result  we believe that using the above definition of a renewal more accurately reflects the renewal rate for smartmusic educator subscriptions 
in the fourth quarter of  the educator renewal rate was generally comparable with prior quarters 
the educator renewal rate for the fourth quarter of was compared to in the third quarter of and in the second quarter of the educator renewal rate in the fourth quarter of increased compared to the fourth quarter of rate of 
we believe the lower renewal rate in the fourth quarter of can be attributed to the price increase that was implemented during the third quarter of which resulted in early renewals and purchases prior to the increase 
additionally  there were some educators who delayed adoption of smartmusic due to the late release and product functionality delays in smartmusic gradebook 
we have achieved positive cash flow from operations for the last seven years  including the most recent year ended december  our quarterly results will fluctuate as a result of the seasonality of the education market and timing of our finale upgrade cycle 
due to current economic conditions  concerns over school budgets and planned technology investments  we remain cautious regarding our future financial projections 
however  with increased revenues and  in particular  the growth in smartmusic subscriptions and acquisition of garritan corporation  we feel that we can continue to achieve positive operating cash flow for the next twelve months while continuing to make investments in our operations and technology 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our distribution of notation products in domestic and international markets through independent dealers and distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts  however  none are greater than of the total revenue 
some international customers pay for the product prior to shipment  domestic dealers and distributors who do not prepay are granted payment terms and credit limits based on credit checks and account history 
we have successfully done business with most of our dealers and distributors for many years 
there were no significant uncollectible accounts in or 
table of contents any sales directly to home users are prepaid and schools submit purchase orders for purchases 
makemusic records an accrual for potential non payments  which has historically been sufficient to cover uncollected accounts 
financial conditions in international markets and economic conditions can change quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 
sales returns and allowance reserves 
smartmusic teacher subscriptions automatically renew at the end of their subscription period 
notices of renewal are sent to the teacher in advance and an invoice is sent upon the renewal date 
a reserve is booked for those subscriptions that automatically renew and are subsequently cancelled due to teacher relocation  teacher cancellation  or non payment of accounts 
the reserve is then evaluated quarterly to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
when a new version of finale is released  dealers and distributors retain the right to return any unsold versions of the prior release normally up to of total prior year sales in exchange for an equal number of units of the updated version of the product that is returned 
the history of these returns is tracked and revenue is deferred based on the expected return rate until the new product is released  at which time the product may be returned for credit provided the customer places an equivalent number of units order for the new version 
inventory valuation 
inventories  consisting of packaged product  materials and accessories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost method 
we record a provision to adjust slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market based on historical experience and current product demand 
the carrying value of inventory is evaluated at least quarterly and adjusted as needed 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence when the inventory is no longer used in products in their most current released version 
stock based compensation 
accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of income the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense we recognize for each option award 
there are several assumptions that we must make when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends payable  and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the options and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
capitalized software costs 
costs incurred in the development of software products are capitalized in accordance with asc  software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  which requires the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established when the detailed program design and all planning and testing activities are completed 
capitalization of computer software costs shall cease when a product is available for general release to customers 
we capitalize the costs of producing any new software product  which includes individual song titles to be included as repertoire with the smartmusic product 
the estimated economic life of smartmusic gradebook  whose capitalization and market introduction was completed in  has been established as five years 
this five year amortization period is consistent with the initial licensing term for the large ensemble titles available in smartmusic that have pre authored assignments for use by teachers within smartmusic gradebook 
similarly  upon release of a large ensemble song title into smartmusic  we amortize the related capitalized software costs over the estimated life of the song  not to exceed the five year licensing period 
a reserve is recorded for an estimate of song titles that will not be released 
annual development of notation products consists of maintenance costs that are expensed as incurred 
in the future  capitalized software will include the costs of new garritan sound libraries 
we will continue to review our amortization period for capitalized software costs as considered necessary based upon any new information and information gained in our review of the net realizable value of unamortized costs 
post contract support 
we account for software maintenance offered on our notation products in accordance with asc  software software revenue recognition  which states that revenue for post contract support pcs may be recognized upon the initial sale when pcs is included with the initial license  the cost of providing pcs during the arrangement is insignificant  there are no unspecified upgrades  and only minor bug fixes are offered to licensed users 
the estimated related costs for support are accrued in the same period that the sales price is recognized 
we provide unlimited  free telephone  e mail  and on line technical support to our customers and  therefore  accrue an estimated cost of future support for our notation products in the period of sale 

table of contents impairment of goodwill 
we review goodwill for potential impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
we have assigned all of our goodwill  including the goodwill attributed to our acquisitions in  to the notation reporting unit and compare the fair value of this reporting unit  as computed primarily by applying a combination of income and market valuation approaches  to its book carrying value  including goodwill step 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and we would then complete step to arrive at an implied fair value of the goodwill  by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the reported value of goodwill  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates by us  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by reporting units  the risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method provided by asc  income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we assess the likelihood that  and the extent to which  our deferred tax assets will be realized and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
if we increase or decrease a valuation allowance in a given period  then we must increase or decrease the tax provision in our statements of income 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  federal alternative minimum tax carry forwards of  minnesota net operating loss carry forwards of  federal research and development tax credits of  and minnesota research and development tax credits of  the losses and tax credits are carried forward for federal and state corporate income taxes and may be used to reduce future taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we remained uncertain on how economic conditions would impact our back to school selling cycle and annual financial results 
based upon our strong performance in the fourth quarter of  our operating results in recent years and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined in that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our valuation allowance by  representing the approximate estimated tax on three years of forecasted net income 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the balance of our deferred tax assets  as of december   we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of  should the remaining  valuation allowance be reversed in the future  a liability of up to  would have to be established for uncertain tax positions 
as required by asc  income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
in addition  future utilization of nol carry forwards is subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
such a change in ownership occurred in connection with the coda reverse merger  thereby potentially restricting the nols available 
in  we completed a further section analysis for the time period since the reverse merger and determined that there are limitations relating to ownership changes 
the acquisition of additional shares by a greater than shareholder in january resulted in an ownership change under section over a three year period resulting in potential future limitations on the utilization of our nols 

table of contents an updated section analysis was recently completed in february the results of that analysis indicate that no further ownership changes under section have occurred 
therefore  the limitation caused by the january ownership change continues to apply 
on february   our board of directors adopted a tax asset protection plan the plan intended to protect our tax assets 
the plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that we experience an additional ownership change by discouraging any person or group from becoming a percent shareholder and dissuading existing percent or greater shareholders from acquiring additional shares of makemusic s common stock 
the plan will expire and terminate on the earliest of february  or if our board of directors determines that the plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax benefits 
for more information regarding the plan  please refer to our current report on form k filed on february   together with the exhibits attached thereto

we attribute these decreases to the timing of our annual finale update release 
this year s update was released in october  as compared to last year s release in june smartmusic revenue increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue reflects the continued growth of the smartmusic product that was originally launched in and the smartmusic gradebook product that was released in it also reflects the expansion of our direct sales force which focuses on district level sales

revenue for these subscriptions is recognized over the life of the subscription which is typically months 
total earned smartmusic subscription revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  over the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the total number of subscriptions as well as a price increase in the third quarter of when teacher subscriptions increased from to and student subscriptions increased from to total unearned smartmusic subscription revenue deferred revenue was  as of december   an increase of  or  over the balance at december  deferred smartmusic revenue represents the future revenue to be recorded on current subscriptions

other development expenses are unallocated expenses not directly attributable to a particular segment and include it infrastructure and website support costs 
the decrease in development expenses for notation and smartmusic was primarily due to reduced personnel costs relating to the chief technology officer position which was open until august  other open development positions and reduced incentive compensation due to annual financial results 
smartmusic consulting expenses were also lower in due to completion in of upgrades to the smartmusic user interface design 
in addition  expenses for smartmusic repertoire development decreased slightly during compared to  despite an increase to the number of titles released

in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including operating results from the most recent fiscal years and our assessment of expected future profitability and the overall prospects for our business 
based on all the available evidence  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets 
as a result  we reduced our valuation allowance by approximately  as of december  and december   the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets was approximately  in the event the valuation allowance on the net operating losses expiring in is reversed we will need to recognize a reserve for uncertain tax positions of up to  significant management judgment is required to determine when  in the future  the realization of our net deferred tax assets will become more likely than not 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available based on actual and forecasted operating results

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   a decrease of  the reduction in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the reduction in net income for fiscal  attributed to lower notation revenue and an increase in cash used for working capital due to bonus payments in the first quarter of relating to the incentive plan 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements have related to adding titles and method books to smartmusic and investing in other product development efforts
