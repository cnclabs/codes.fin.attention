table of contents overview the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by monarch bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
monarch bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
we also generate income from non interest sources 
non interest income sources include bank related service charges  fee income from residential mortgage sales  fee income from the sale of investment and insurance services  income from bank owned life insurance boli policies  as well as gains or losses from the sale of investment securities 
analysis of operating results net income our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries  after all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests of  and  respectively  are deducted for the years ended december  and  after the income tax provision  to arrive at net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc the ensuing references and ratios are related to net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc  hereon referred to as net income after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest has been deducted 
income before taxes income tax provision net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc we reported net income for december  of  compared to  for december  our basic earnings per share were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were for december   and for december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on stockholders equity net income as a percentage of average stockholders equity 
our returns on average assets were and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average stockholders equity were  and for the same time periods 
net income for the year ended december  was  an increase of compared to this growth was attributable to an increase in both net interest income and non interest income as well as a reduction in loan loss provision  when compared to net income available to common stockholders  which is net of preferred stock dividends of  in both periods presented  was  at december   compared to  in net interest income increased million or to million in compared to earning asset growth coupled with lower cost liabilities were the source of this increase 
loans held for sale increased million and loans held for investment grew million  year over year 
average outstanding loans held for investment increased million while average loans held for sale decreased million 
the combined yield on these assets improved basis points 
deposits increased million year over year and average outstanding deposits outstanding increased million 
the overall costs associated with deposits declined basis points 
although total borrowings increased million  year over year  average outstanding borrowings declined million  thereby reducing interest expense to further benefit net interest income 

table of contents non interest income increased million to million in our primary source of non interest income is mortgage banking income  which increased thousand  or for a total of million 
our mortgage division  operating under the name of monarch mortgage delivered strong production 
other non interest income increased thousand in compared to included in other non interest income are net proceeds from bank owned life insurance boli totaling non interest expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the majority of these increases were in salaries and benefits  occupancy  loan origination expenses  marketing  data processing  and professional fees 
these increases were due to several factors which include loan growth  regulatory changes and operational upgrades and expansion 
our provision for loan losses was million in  million  or less than our provision of million 
at the same time net charge offs were million  a decrease in net losses of million or compared to million one year prior 
our allowance for future losses increased thousand in the provision is a function of loan portfolio management in that management seeks to provide for future losses inherent in the existing portfolio and in new loan growth by utilizing various metrics including but not limited to  loss history  economic conditions and industry trends 
it requires a great deal of judgment and is a primary focus of our management team 
the net effect on pre tax and pre noncontrolling interest income was an increase of  or  to  compared to  in net interest income net interest income  which is the excess of interest income over interest expense  is a significant source of revenue 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  this represents an increase of or  over when net interest income was  rates  though stable  have remained at historically low levels over the past three years while we have been at  or near  the bottom of an economic downturn that began in the later months of at that time  the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  in an effort to stabilize the economy and head off a recession  began to decrease the target funds rate 
between september and december they decreased the target funds rate a total of basis points which resulted in the current  historically low  federal funds rate of 
during this same period  wall street journal prime wsjp  which moves in tandem with the federal funds target rate  has held at 
comments by the fomc indicate that this low rate environment is expected to extend into during we continued the work we began in of reshaping our balance sheet in preparation for future increases in rates 
our focus has been on building our core deposit base while reducing our reliance on noncore funding sources and supporting growth in both our loans held for sale and our loans held for investment portfolios 
we define our core deposits as non brokered  in market deposits 
our loans held for sale remain in our portfolio for an average of days before being delivered to our investors 
therefore any growth in this portfolio is a function of production and timing 
in our loans held for sale increased million  or to million 
the mortgage industry which is interest rate sensitive  continued to offer historically low rates in  leading to high production in both purchase money and refinance markets 
we utilize noncore deposits to support this short term growth 
despite the growth in this portfolio in  we have reduced our reliance on noncore deposits million  through core growth in demand deposits 
in addition  of our noncore deposits  compared to one year prior  now have a maturity of less than days  to allow us to react quickly to changes in loan demand 
we have also worked to stabilize our loans held for investment by strengthening and supporting our existing client base  promoting disciplined growth with regard to new clients  and promoting short term fixed rate loan pricing 
our outstanding loans held for investment have increased million or to million in  despite million in loan payouts 

table of contents total interest income was  in compared to  in earning asset yield declined basis point to in compared to in the prior year 
loan yield is the result of both the interest rate and any fees collected on a loan 
interest and fees on loans are the largest component of our interest income 
interest and fees on loans held for investment increased basis points in to a blended yield of compared to in the yield on our loans held for sale  is driven by the performance of the year treasury note  which has been at record lows for much of therefore  the yield on our loans held for sale portfolio declined basis points in to compared to in volume fluctuations coupled with the changes in yield discussed previously have resulted in an increase in the combined loan portfolios of basis points to in from in the yield on our securities portfolio declined basis points from in to in during  million of the million in outstanding securities at december  either matured or were subject to rate call 
securities purchased in had a blended yield which was lower resulting in an overall decline in portfolio yield 
the yield on our boli also declined in from to due to market rates 
total interest expense declined  or to  for the year ended december   compared to interest cost declined basis points from in to in interest bearing deposits are the largest component of interest expense  representing on average  of interest bearing liabilities in and in the blended cost of our deposit portfolio declined basis points to in from in despite a year over year decline in money market accounts of million  core money market accounts grew million while noncore brokered money market balances declined million 
average outstanding money market accounts increased million 
a market adjustment in the interest paid on our core money market accounts resulted in a basis point reduction in money market interest from in to in during through management of both core and noncore time deposit pricing  time deposit yields also declined from in to  a basis point reduction in rate 
despite a million year end increase in federal home loan bank advances  average outstanding borrowings were only million in compared to million in the increase in the interest cost on other borrowings  which is primarily federal home loan bank  to from is a function of lower borrowing volume as opposed to an overall increase in rates 
included in our federal home loan borrowings in both periods is a note for approximately million which bears a fixed rate of 
the impact of this note on interest cost is greater because the lower cost borrowings which typically buffer this high cost note were significantly reduced in additional analysis with regard to interest income will reference the following tables 
for discussion purposes  our net interest income analysis and our changes in net interest income rate volume analysis tables are adjusted to include tax equivalent income on bank owned life insurance boli and tax exempt municipal securities that is not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of our income statement presentation to these tables 
reconciliation of net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income for the years ended december  non gaap interest income total interest income bank owned life insurance tax equivalent adjustment tax rate bank owned life insurance municipal securities adjusted income on earning assets interest expense total interest expense net interest income adjusted 
table of contents a tax rate of was used in adjusting interest on boli  tax exempt securities and loans to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin 
table depicts interest income on average earning assets and related yields  as well as interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and related rates paid for the periods indicated 
our net yield on earning assets or net interest margin  which is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets  was in compared to in our earning asset yield was in a decrease of basis point from in during the same periods liability costs declined basis points to in from in our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average cost on interest bearing liabilities  was in compared to in the result of these changes is a basis point improvement in margin for compared to

table of contents table presents changes in net interest income in a rate volume analysis format 
the goal of a rate volume analysis is to compare two or more earning periods to determine whether the difference between the results of those periods is due to changes in rate  or volume  or some combination of the two 
this is achieved through a what if analysis 
we calculate what the potential income would have been in the new period if the prior period rate had remained unchanged  and compare that result to what the potential income would have been in the prior period if the current rates were in effect 
through the analysis of these income potentials  we are able to determine how much of the dollar change between periods is due to the impact of differing rates and how much is volume driven 
net interest income has been adjusted to include income from boli and the tax effect of tax exempt municipal securities 
our net interest income in increased million when compared to  million of this increase was due to changes in volume and thousand was due to changes in rates 
earning asset growth provided million to volume driven earnings while reductions in high cost liabilities provided an additional million to interest income growth 
lower blended deposit rates saved an additional million in liability costs which were reduced to thousand by changes in rates in both loans and other borrowings 
growth and changes in interest rates of our loans held for investment portfolio contributed an additional million to income while the impact of both rates and volume on our loans held for sale portfolio was an interest reduction of million 
the combined contribution to net interest income of our remaining earning assets was thousand driven by growth in our average outstanding securities which was offset by lower earning rates 
a decrease in interest expense contributed an additional million to net interest income in reductions in liability cost of thousand were further enhanced by changes in volume which resulted in a cost savings of million 
interest bearing deposits  which are the primary source of interest expense  grew an average of million in at a potential cost of thousand which was more than offset by a million savings potential due to rate reductions 
other borrowings provided thousand in interest cost reductions  million due to lower average borrowings which was partially offset by higher rates on those borrowings

our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  and our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility are to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk  reporting our performance results to our board 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 

table of contents there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of our interest sensitivity position 
as illustrated in the table  we appear to be liability sensitive at three months or less  primarily due to our large money market base and short term brokered time deposit maturities 
with the majority of our borrowings and deposits short  our current structure allows us pricing flexibility to react to changes in rates when they occur 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis in thousands december  months or less months to year year to years years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold securities loans bank owned life insurance total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities now and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis  alco uses more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising interest rates in increments of   and and falling interest rates in decrements of and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve and twenty four months  with flat growth  under two rate assumptions 
the assumptions are shocked  in which the entire rate change is assumed to have occurred in a 
table of contents single month  and ramped  in which the rate change is assumed to have occurred spread throughout the analysis period 
alco also applies a shocked and ramped assumption when measuring the effects of changes in interest rates over a twelve month period on mve by discounting future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
tables and a show the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up   and and down and  on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
change in net interest income shocked assumption results the projected change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates in the twelve month projection at december   were in compliance with our established guidelines for increases of    and and decreases of 
in the twenty four month projection  the degree of change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates were in compliance with our established guidelines for increases of   and and down 
decreases in interest rates of were non compliant under both time projected time periods and increases of were non compliant for twenty four months 
ramped assumption results the projected change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates in the twelve month projection at december   were in compliance with our established guidelines at all rate increments 
in the twenty four month projection  the degree of change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates were in compliance with our established guidelines for increases of   and and down  but a change in interest income due to a decrease of was non compliant 
market value of equity under both the shocked and ramped assumptions changes in the market value of equity for increases of    and  and decreases in rate of were in compliance with our established guidelines 
however for decreases of the results were not within our guidelines 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on flat growth assumptions and no changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that our net interest income would rise if rates increase and fall if rates decline 
the simulation analysis supports the actions that management has made with regard to shortening of maturities and the introduction of short term fixed pricing on loans coupled with deposit rate and term adjustments to position the company for future changes in rates 
we continue to focus on compliance through the tightening of lending guidelines and the establishment of floors for certain products

monarch mortgage  our residential mortgage division  was reorganized and expanded in june  making its first full year of operations 
was another record year for monarch mortgage with total dollar volume of  compared to  in the total number of loans closed was  in compared to  in service charges declined thousand in despite growth in deposits 
in june changes by the federal reserve to regulation e limited the ability of banks to charge fees for paying overdrafts caused by atm and debit card transactions 
these changes adversely impacted our overdraft nsf program  by limiting the forms of transactions to be covered for a retail client who overdraws their accounts without the negative stigma associated with a returned check 
service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically reevaluated annually to reflect current costs and competition 
title income increased thousand in with the increased levels of loan closings during the year 
title income was generated through real estate security agency  llc  a subsidiary of monarch investment  llc  which owns of the company 
during the third quarter of  we received proceeds from boli of  which resulted in a  reduction in the value of our boli asset 
the remaining  in proceeds is tax exempt non interest income 
the majority of this income was paid out in death benefits 
the tax effective income from these proceeds was  in october we purchased  in bank owned life insurance boli that has resulted in income and commissions in each of the two years presented 
income from boli is not subject to tax 
the tax effective income earnings from boli are  in and  in we offer investment services  through our investment division  monarch investments

table of contents non interest expense non interest expense was  for compared to  in  an increase of  or 
the following table lists the major components of non interest expense for december  and year ended december  commissions salaries and employee benefits loan origination expenses occupancy expenses furniture and equipment expense marketing expense data processing services professional fees foreclosed property expense telephone fdic insurance stationary and supplies virginia franchise tax postage atm expense amortization of intangible assets other the dollar and percentage change of listed expenses is provided below 
year ended december  vs 
dollars percentage salaries and employee benefits commissions foreclosed property expense occupancy expenses loan origination expenses marketing expense furniture and equipment expense data processing services professional fees telephone virginia franchise tax postage atm expense stationary and supplies fdic insurance a portion of the increase in salaries and employee benefits is related to the decrease in commissions 
the majority of commissions paid are tied to mortgage origination production 
new regulations imposed by the dodd frank act that limit when and how commissions are paid to our mortgage sales team have resulted in shifts between commissions and salaries for some employees  which brought us into compliance with the act 
further  new compliance requirements and growth related expansion throughout the company have added to compensation expense 
at december   we employed a total of full and part time employees compared to at year end in addition  higher compensation related benefits such as social security tax and medicare tax expenses have contributed to the increase 

table of contents foreclosed property expense is related to maintenance and sale of our other real estate 
at january  there were five properties in other real estate 
during the year  fifteen additional properties were moved into other real estate and fourteen properties were sold 
the fourteen properties were sold at a net gain of  based on additional market information and property evaluations  five properties were written down  after being moved into other real estate 
maintenance and selling costs associated with other real estate were  in at january  there were eight properties in other real estate 
during the year  thirteen additional properties were moved into other real estate and sixteen properties were sold 
the sixteen properties were sold at a net gain of  one property was written down  subsequent to being moved into other real estate 
maintenance and selling costs associated with other real estate were  in we relocated three of our banking offices in in an effort to improve our presence in the community and position for future growth 
these offices were the downtown norfolk office which was relocated to the world trade center in downtown norfolk  our ghent office  which was moved from a small store front location to a freestanding  company owned  building located on a prominent corner in the ghent section of norfolk  and our kitty hawk office  which was also relocated from a store front to a freestanding  company owned  building on a prominent corner in kitty hawk 
we continue to upgrade our corporate headquarters which we moved into in september our mortgage operations continue to expand to new markets as well 
these additions and improvements have contributed to the increases in both occupancy and furniture and equipment expense in loan expense continues to grow as a function of costs associated with underwriting and processing mortgage loans at our current volume 
additionally  expense related to the shipping of mortgage loan packages to secondary market investors has had an impact on postage 
the telephone is a critical tool for our mortgage lenders as most spend time out of the office meeting with clients and prospects 
this expense has grown with our mortgage operations 
in  monarch stepped up its marketing focus to include activities aimed at gaining greater recognition in the community 
these activities included  media advertisement  higher visibility sponsorships  greater community involvement  and the launch of the first annual top flight award aimed at recognizing small businesses in the community that have demonstrated a strong performance in a number of key areas 
technology is critical to our success as a company 
changes and innovations in technology are rapidly finding their way to the banking industry and in monarch made a commitment to focus our efforts on providing our clients with secure  leading edge technology and service 
although we are still in the early stages  expenses related to upgrades and technology conversion of our existing systems have resulted in increased data processing costs 
professional fees include legal  accounting  and consulting expenses 
loan portfolio management  company growth and increased and changing regulatory issues have led to increased professional fees as we seek advice in areas outside our expertise 
fdic insurance declined for the first time since in  the fdic changed its methodology for assessing banks from a deposit based to an asset and equity based calculation 
this change resulted in a shift in the insurance burden to larger institutions and a savings for smaller institutions 
we continue to focus on controlling overhead expenses in relation to income growth 
our efficiency ratio  a productivity measure used to determine how well non interest expense is managed  was in and in our bank only efficiency ratio was in  compared to in a lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense efficiency 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and non interest income 
increased regulatory burden and expenses associated with our non interest income lines of business have negatively impacted this ratio 
income taxes in we recognized federal income tax expense of  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
included in income are life insurance proceeds  boli income and municipal security income that is not subject to federal tax totaling  additionally  deferred tax adjustments related to a change in our statutory tax rate from to on earnings in excess of million resulted in a reduction in current year tax recognition 
we recognized state tax expense related to our multi state mortgage operations of  in we recognized federal income tax expense of  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
we also recognized state tax expense related to our multi state mortgage operations of  which included  in taxes from previous years 
the major difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate results from income that is not taxable and expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
the primary non taxable income is from bank owned life insurance and non deductible expenses are for meals entertainment 

table of contents segment reporting our reportable segments include community banking and retail mortgage banking services 
community banking involves making loans to and generating deposits from individuals and businesses in the markets where we have offices 
our mortgage banking services consist of originating residential loans and subsequently selling them to investors 
our mortgage banking segment is a strategic business unit that is managed separately from the community banking segment because the mortgage banking services segment appeals to different markets and  accordingly  requires different technology and marketing strategies

most variable rate loans carry an interest rate tied to the wall street journal prime rate  as published in the wall street journal 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k provides a schedule of loans by type and other information 
we do not participate in highly leveraged lending transactions  as defined by the regulators  and there are no loans of this nature recorded in the loan portfolio 
we do not have foreign loans in our portfolio 
at december   we had two loan concentrations loans to borrowers engaged in similar activities which exceeded of total loans in two areas

these fees were thousand in and thousand in allowance and provision for loan losses we have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to balance loan growth and income with an acceptable level of risk  which management reviews and approves on a regular basis 
our review process is supported by a series of reports related to loan production  loan quality  credit concentrations  policy exceptions  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
we also utilize diversification in our loan portfolio as a means of managing risk 
our allowance for loan losses is to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management is responsible for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by our board of directors 
among other factors  we consider on a monthly basis our historical loss experience  the size and composition of our loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans and our risk rating based loan watch list  and local and national economic conditions 
the economy of our trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
to determine the total allowance for loan losses  we estimate the reserves needed for each segment of the portfolio  including loans analyzed on both  a pooled basis and individually 
our allowance for loan losses consists of amounts applicable to the following loan types i the commercial loan portfolio  ii the real estate loan portfolio  iii the consumer loan portfolio 
in addition  loans within these portfolios are evaluated as a group or on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade based on the underlying characteristics 
loans are pooled by risk grade within the portfolio types  and losses are modeled utilizing metrics such as the risk rating  historical experience  other known and inherent risks  and quantitative techniques which management has determined fit the characteristics of that type 
the commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans which are usually secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and normally incorporate a personal guarantee  however  some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis 
commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business 
the real estate loan portfolio includes all loans secured by real estate 
this type is further broken down into the following segments construction loans  residential family loans  home equity lines  multifamily loans  and commercial real estate loans 
construction and multifamily loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project 
residential family and home equity loan originations utilize analytics to supplement the underwriting process 
commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans  in addition to those of real estate loans 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 

table of contents commercial and real estate portfolio loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade at the time the loan is made 
additionally  we perform periodic reviews of the loan or relationship to determine if there have been any changes in the original underwriting which would change the risk grade and or impact the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
the consumer loan portfolio includes consumer and installment loans and overdraft protection loans 
these loans  which are in relatively small loan amounts  are spread across many individual borrowers 
we utilize analytics to supplement general underwriting 
loans within the consumer class are assigned risk grades and evaluated as a pool  unless specifically identified through delinquency or other signs of credit deterioration  at which time the identified loan is individually evaluated 
additionally  loans that have been specifically identified as a credit risk due to circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal are analyzed on an individual basis 
adverse circumstances may include loss of repayment source  deterioration in the estimated value of collateral  elevated trends of delinquencies  and charge offs 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses monthly in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is sufficient to absorb probable credit losses 
such factors as the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies are also considered 
from time to time  events or economic factors may affect the loan portfolio  causing management to provide additional amounts to or release balances from the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to risk ratings assigned to individually evaluated loans  economic assumptions  and delinquency trends driving statistically modeled reserves 
there are nine numerical risk grades that can be assigned to loans pass watch list minimal special mention modest substandard average doubtful acceptable loss acceptable with care special mention 
table of contents the following table delineates  in thousands  our loan portfolio by class and pass and watch list risk grade for the years ended december  and table loans by risk grade in thousands pass watchlist total commercial real estate construction residential family home equity lines multifamily commercial real estate subtotal consumers consumer and installment loans overdraft protection loans loans to individuals subtotal total gross loans unamortized loan costs  net of deferred fees total net loans pass watchlist total commercial real estate construction residential family home equity lines multifamily commercial real estate subtotal consumers consumer and installment loans overdraft protection loans loans to individuals subtotal total gross loans unamortized loan costs  net of deferred fees total net loans a loan risk graded a loss is charged off when identified and a loan risk graded as doubtful is classified as a nonaccrual loan 
at december  we did not have any loans risk graded as a loss or as doubtful 
we do not have any potential problem loans which have not been evaluated and disclosed at december  loans identified as special mention and substandard may or may not be classified as nonaccrual  based on current performance 
watch list loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis to determine if any  or all  of our loans to the borrower is at risk 
we evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
for additional discussion on this evaluation refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this evaluation includes  but is not limited to  the application of a loss factor using a three year moving average look back at our historical losses 
this loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding principal within each segment to arrive at an overall loss estimate 
environmental factors may also be applied to a class or classes of loans based on management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  external audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio classes  etc 
any unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 

table of contents the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy 
this examination may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
in  we accrued  in provision for loan losses compared to  in based on the current economic environment and the composition of our loan portfolio  the level of our charged off loans combined with our peer bank loss experience  we considered this provision to be a prudent allocation of funds for our loan loss allowance 
loans charged off during totaled  compared to  in and recoveries totaled  and  in and  respectively 
the ratio of net charge offs to average outstanding loans was in compared to in in  approximately million of the loan balances charged off were tied to four relationships which had been identified by management as impaired or uncollectible  million of that was related to a single borrower whose business activities failed 
in  million in loans charged off were related to failed real estate projects  million in loans charged off were related to failed business activities and the remaining million were related to residential properties 
in  approximately million of the loan balances charged off were tied to seven relationships which had been identified by management as impaired or uncollectible  million of that total was related to three real estate development projects which have been adversely impacted by the downturn in the real estate market and million was due to four failed business activities 
several smaller charge offs were also related to failed business activities totaling approximately thousand 
approximately million was related to equity line default and an additional thousand in charged off balances were related to residential properties 
during  we developed a new allowance model 
as disclosed during the second and third quarter q filings  we ran the original model and the new model concurrently  which resulted in no difference in the calculated provision for loan losses 
as of december   we reverted back to the original model

table of contents asset quality and non performing loans we identify specific credit exposures through periodic analysis of our loan portfolio and monitor general exposures from economic trends  market values and other external factors 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a monthly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings  and these are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were and at december  and december   respectively 
there were seventeen loans totaling  in non accrual status at december  and twenty three loans at december  totaling  all of these loans have been identified as impaired according to accounting standards codification  receivables 
a loan is considered impaired if it is probable that the lender will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement

deposits provide funding for our investment in loans and securities 
our primary objective is to increase core deposits as a means to fund asset growth at a lower cost 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
we offer individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money market  and certificates of deposit 
table presents the average balances of deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits for the past two years in thousands 

table of contents table deposits in thousands average balance average rate average balance average rate demand deposits non interest bearing now accounts money market accounts savings accounts time deposits we are continually evaluating the mix of our deposit base time deposits versus demand  money market and savings in relation to our funding needs and current market conditions 
demand deposit products are an area of focus due to their low cost 
noninterest bearing demand deposits grew an average million or in low interest  now accounts increased an average of million or 
in  we participated in the federal deposit insurance transaction account guarantee program  which provided that through december  our clients received unlimited coverage for balances in both their non interest bearing and low interest bearing deposit accounts 
this program expired december   but provisions of the dodd frank act provide separate unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand and interest on lawyer trust accounts ioltas until december  non interest bearing demand deposits increased an average of million or in the majority of our non interest bearing demand accounts are commercial  small business and attorney escrow accounts commercial accounts have increased an average of million in the past year 
now accounts grew million on average in the majority of our now accounts are personal accounts 
monarch began focusing on growing low cost demand and now accounts several years ago 
this focus has taken the form of developing a well trained  dedicated cash management team with a goal of providing high quality service and cost effective products to our commercial and small business clients  thereby growing business deposits and also obtaining their personal banking accounts in the process 
savings account balances declined an average million or in this declining trend may be attributable to short term fluctuations or a move from savings to money market or time deposits 
savings accounts are typically utilized by individuals with limited savings capacity or with specific short term goals  looking for a place to set aside funds but are not particularly interest rate sensitive 
money market accounts have increased an average million or in our money market portfolio consists of both core and noncore accounts 
throughout and the first nine months of  we had two brokered money market clients that averaged balances of approximately million in the first nine months of and million for all of in september we ended one of those brokered relationships and renegotiated the remaining relationship  thereby reducing brokered money market accounts to an approximate average of million for the remainder of core money market accounts increased an average million or in our core money market account is a multi tiered product offering better rates than savings accounts but at higher deposit levels 
it is a highly competitive product that offers more flexibility than time deposits with the benefit of rates comparable with short term time deposits 
we have chosen to focus on growth in our money market product in rather than growing time deposits because of their short term nature and the benefits this adds in managing maturities in our portfolio 
in we simplified our array of existing consumer demand products into four basic products which  we believe  offer our clients services that fit their specific needs 
in addition  we consolidated our money market products into two highly competitive products 
these changes were aimed at building client relationships rather than single accounts 
this goal was been further enhanced by price differentiation on our time deposits for clients and non clients

we had million in municipal deposits in cdars at december  we use our brokered time deposits primarily to fund our loans held for sale portfolio 
cdars offers short term cd products called one way buys  which allow participants to bid weekly for available deposits at specified terms 
at december  four of our brokered deposits totaling million were in the form of cdars one way buys with remaining terms of between and days 
these deposits work well for monarch because of their weekly availability  coupled with their short term  which allows us to more closely mirror the funding needs of our loans held for sale

our liquidity is provided from cash and amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in other banks  repayments from loans  increases in deposits  lines of credit from the federal home loan bank and five correspondent banks  and maturing investments 
as a result of our management of liquid assets  and our ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  we believe that we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and to meet clients credit needs 
we also take into account any liquidity needs generated by off balance sheet transactions such as commitments to extend credit  commitments to purchase securities and standby letters of credit

these funds are accessed through a weekly auction 
the auction typically takes place on wednesdays  with next day settlement 
there are seven maturities available ranging from weeks to years 
if we are allotted funds in the auction  we incur no transaction fees or commissions 
although the process to compete for these deposits is different from the process for traditional brokered cds  they are still considered brokered for call report purposes

since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
our critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on gaap guidance which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
derivative financial instruments we use derivatives to manage risks related to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported at fair value 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge initially is included as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest on the related debt is paid 
we document our risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
our interest rate risk management strategy is to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap contracts to convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
periodically  we participate in a mandatory delivery program for mortgage loans 
under the mandatory delivery system  loans with interest rate locks are paired with the sale of a notional security bearing similar attributes 
interim income or loss on the pairing of the loans and securities is recorded in mortgage banking income on our income statement 
in addition  at the time the loan is delivered to an investor  matched securities are repurchased and a gain or loss on the pairing is recorded in mortgage banking income on our income statement 
management has elected to limit our exposure to this form of delivery to million in outstanding loans 
we were not participating in the mandatory delivery program at december  
table of contents fair value measurements under gaap we are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets  including loans held for sale  available for sale securities  and foreclosed real estate owned 
these assets are recorded at fair value or lower of cost or fair value  as applicable 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on published market or dealer quotes for similar securities 
the fair values of rate lock commitments are based on net fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements 
the fair value of foreclosed real estate owned is estimated based on our evaluation of fair value of similar properties 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and subject to material changes that could impact our financial condition and results of operation 
non gaap presentations our management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
we feel the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under gaap is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on our balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
we feel that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and our ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by our board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
our board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  this committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern our asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while this committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling and month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 

table of contents the results of this simulation model are presented in tables and a included in item of this form k 
this model assumes flat growth and captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one and two year horizon given a   and basis point bp upward shift or a  or basis point downward shift in interest rates 
the model does simulations using two assumptions  a sudden or shocked one month shift in rates and a ramped parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month and month period for changes in net interest income and for months for market value of portfolio equity sensitivity 
the following reflects the range of our net interest income sensitivity analysis and market value of portfolio equity sensitivity as of december  all of the results in the net interest income met the approved policy limits of our asset liability management policy with the exception of the shocked assumption for an upward shift of basis points in the month period and downward shift of basis points in both the and month periods 
net interest income met the approved policy limits for all rate shifts presented in both the month and month period with the exception of a downward shift of basis points and month period 
the results of changes in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity indicate that downward shifts of basis points under both assumptions would yield results that were not within the approved limits 
we continue to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 
in we began running the model with the assumption of flat growth  which is a departure from our previous budget based model 
it is a snapshot approach that captures how the assets and liabilities that are on our balance sheet at a specific point in time  which in this case is december   would perform under changing rate scenarios 
this approach only focuses on management s decisions about the pricing  structure and duration of assets and liabilities to that point  filtering out the impact of future decisions 
this is a beneficial simulation because it allows management to assess current strategies and determine if changes need to be made in the future with regard to those strategies 
the potential impact of rising rates on net interest income and equity is a primary concern for most members of the banking industry today  because rates have remained at historic lows long enough for the majority of assets and liabilities to re price to the low levels creating a potential for liability sensitivity 
borrowers want to lock in loan rates for a longer period when rates are low because it decreases their costs 
at the same time  depositors want to keep time deposits and similar savings products short so that they are not locked in to lower earnings when rates rise 
this combination creates liability sensitivity  which results in margin compression when rates rise because rates on deposits and borrowings increase at a faster pace than rates on loans and other earning assets 
monarch has attempted to balance the desires of our clients with the realities of positioning the bank for protection from margin compression in the future 
based on model results  monarch s balance sheet appears to be adequately positioned avoid margin compression when rates begin to rise 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  asset and liability growth  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flow 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that our alco committee might take in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates
