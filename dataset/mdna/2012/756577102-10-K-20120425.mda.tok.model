item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global leader in providing open source software technologies to enterprise customers 
these offerings include our core enterprise operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux  our enterprise middleware platform  red hat jboss middleware  as well as our virtualization  cloud  and storage offerings and other red hat enterprise technologies 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software 
because open source software code is often freely shared  there are customarily no licensing fees for the use of open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the development  aggregation  integration  testing  certification  delivery  maintenance and support of our red hat enterprise technologies  and by providing a level of performance  reliability  scalability and security for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute 
moreover  because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings  opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities 
we primarily offer our enterprise technologies in the form of annual or multi year subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers 
we market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises  government agencies  small and medium size businesses and educational institutions 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for red hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture 
our core enterprise operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux  has gained widespread isv and ihv support 
we have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise offerings and introducing middleware  virtualization  cloud  storage and other offerings 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources i subscription revenue and ii training and services revenue 
these arrangements typically involve subscriptions to red hat enterprise technologies 
our revenue is affected by  among other factors  corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors  including total revenue  deferred revenue  operating income  operating margin and cash flows from operations 
the arrangements with our customers that produce this revenue and cash are explained in further detail in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
in our fiscal year ended february   we focused and expect in our fiscal year ended february  to continue to focus on  among other things  generating i widespread adoption of red hat enterprise technologies  including virtualization  cloud and storage technologies  by users globally  ii increased revenue from our existing user base by renewing existing subscriptions  converting users of free versions of our enterprise technologies to paying subscribers  providing additional value to our customers and growing the number of open source enterprise technologies we offer  iii increased revenue by providing additional consulting and other targeted services and iv increased revenue from channel partner relationships  including oems  ihvs  isvs  cloud computing providers  vars and system integrators  and from our own international expansion  among other means 
revenue 
for the year ended february   total revenue increased  or million  to  million from million for the year ended february  subscription revenue increased or million  driven primarily by additional subscriptions related to our principal red hat enterprise 
table of contents linux technologies  which continue to gain broader market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing  and our expansion of sales channels and our geographic footprint 
the increase is  in part  a result of the continued migration of enterprises in industries such as financial services  government  technology and telecommunications to our open source solutions from proprietary technologies 
training and services revenue increased or million for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  the increase is driven primarily by customer interest in new products and technologies 
we believe the success of our business model is influenced by the extent to which we can expand the breadth and depth of our technology and service offerings  our ability to enhance the value of subscriptions for red hat enterprise technologies through frequent and continuing innovations to these technologies while maintaining stable platforms over multi year periods  our ability to generate increasing revenue from channel partner and other strategic relationships  including distributors  oems  ihvs  isvs  cloud computing providers  vars and system integrators  the acceptance and widespread deployment of open source technologies by small  medium and large enterprises  educational institutions and government agencies  our ability to generate recurring subscription revenue for red hat enterprise technologies  and our ability to provide customers with consulting and training services that generate additional revenue 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue  current and long term  balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenue improves predictability of future revenue 
deferred revenue at february  increased million or as compared to the balance at february  of million 
the change in deferred revenue reported on our consolidated balance sheets of million differs from the million change in deferred revenue we reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended february  due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries functional currency into us dollars 
subscription revenue 
our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
the subscription entitles the end user to maintenance  which generally consists of a specified level of support  as well as security updates  fixes  functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased sequentially for each quarter of fiscal  and and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods 
revenue by geography 
in the year ended february   approximately million or of our revenue was generated outside the united states compared to approximately million or for the year ended february  our international operations are expected to continue to grow as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
as of february   we had offices in more than locations throughout the world 

table of contents we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific principally japan  singapore  india  australia  south korea and china 
revenue generated by the americas  emea and asia pacific for the three years ended february  was as follows in thousands americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  year over year revenue growth rates for our three geographical regions were as follows for the three years ended february  americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  revenue from emea and asia pacific grew approximately and  respectively  for the year ended february  asia pacific s currency adjusted  year over year growth rate of approximately was achieved despite the earthquake and related disasters in japan  the only country outside of the us approaching of total revenue 
as we expand further within each region  we anticipate revenue growth rates to become more similar among our geographic regions due to the similarity of products and services offered and the similarity in customer types or classes 
gross profit margin 
gross profit margin increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  as a result of both an overall increase in profit margins related to training and services and a slight product mix shift to subscriptions 
gross profit margin on training and services revenue increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february   primarily as a result of higher utilization rates for our consulting personnel and the implementation of a contractual arrangement with a global training partner that provides certain training services on our behalf and bears a portion of the fixed cost of providing such services  which makes our training expenses more variable with demand 
gross profit margin by geography 
gross profit margins generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended february  were as follows americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  as we continue to expand our sales and support services within our geographic segments  we expect gross profit margins to further converge over the long run due to the similarity of products and services offered  similarity in production and distribution methods and the similarity in customer types or classes 
regional year over year variations in gross profit margins are typically due to slight product mix shifts between subscriptions and services  with the exception of the decrease in the americas gross profit margin from for the year 
table of contents ended february  to for the year ended february   which was due to both a slight product mix shift and lower gross margins on training and services revenue as we used more outside consultants and off site training facilities to deliver our training and professional services during the year ended february  income from operations 
operating income was and of total revenue for the year ended february  and february   respectively 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue is a result of both the increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percent of revenue 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  the decrease in operating expenses results primarily from a reduction in professional services expenses related to litigation of million for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  income from operations by geography 
operating income as a percentage of revenue generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended february  was as follows americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  total operating income as a percentage of revenue includes corporate non allocated share based compensation expense for the years ending february   february  and february  of million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information  see note segment reporting 
operating margin for the americas increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  primarily as a result of reduced professional services expenses related to litigation that arose in the americas 
operating margin for emea decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  as a result of a product mix shift from subscriptions to services 
cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt and equity securities and cash flow from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term available for sale investments in securities balances at february  totaled billion 
cash generated from operating activities for the year ended february  totaled million  which represents an increase of in operating cash flow as compared to the year ended february  this increase is due to an increase in subscription and services revenues  billings and collections during the same period 
our significant cash and investment balances give us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions  increasing investment in international areas and repurchasing our common stock 
foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the statements of operations of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue and operating expenses from operations for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses will decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 

table of contents using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended february   our revenue and operating expenses from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been lower than we reported using the average exchange rates for our current fiscal year ending february  by approximately million and million  respectively  which would have resulted in income from operations being lower by million 
business combinations 
on october   we acquired gluster  inc gluster 
gluster develops  distributes and provides support for open source  scale out storage software 
the acquisition expands our enterprise software offerings to include management of unstructured data 
total consideration transferred as part of the acquisition was million and includes cash consideration of million and equity consideration related to assumed  nonvested employee share based awards of million 
the total fair value  as of october   of all assumed nonvested awards was million  of which million has been attributed to pre acquisition employee services and accordingly has been recognized as consideration transferred 
the remaining million of fair value will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
see note business combinations to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to our acquisition of gluster 
on november   we acquired makara  a developer of deployment and management solutions for applications in the cloud

table of contents critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements and describe our methods for applying us gaap in areas such as revenue recognition  deferred selling costs  fair value measurements  and foreign currency translation among other areas deemed significant 
in applying certain significant accounting policies  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which we discuss further below 
critical accounting estimates are applied in the following areas revenue recognition  goodwill and other long lived assets  share based compensation  income taxes  and loss contingencies revenue recognition application of accounting principles related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires judgment 
for example  in transactions that include multiple elements  we must exercise judgment in determining whether adequate vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
changes to the elements in a transaction  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  and changes in the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
in addition  complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element transaction should be treated as separate units of accounting 
goodwill and other long lived assets we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  including capitalized software purchased or developed for internal use 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine recoverability of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by various factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal  multi year forecasts for our subscription and services offerings which often include emerging technologies 
changes in any of these various factors could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
share based compensation we are required to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest and the amount of tax benefits we expect will ultimately be realized  among other things 
share based awards expected to vest we currently apply an estimated annual forfeiture rate of to the service based share awards we grant to our employees 
our estimated forfeiture rate is based on recent historical experience as well as qualitative 
table of contents considerations about management s expectations for attrition rates over the vesting periods 
actual attrition rates could vary significantly from our expectations resulting in material quarterly adjustments to our financial results 
during the year ended february  we granted service based share awards with a total fair value of million to which we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of 
with respect to performance based awards that we grant to certain executives  we estimate the number of shares expected to vest based primarily on our most current reported financial results relative to a defined peer group s most recent reported financial results 
because past or current financial trends may not be predictive of future financial performance  our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest may differ materially from the number of shares that actually vest 
the number of potential performance based shares available to vest as of february  totaled million  of which million are expected to vest 
if all of the potential performance based shares were to vest  we would be required to recognize an additional expense of approximately million 
see note share based awards for further discussion related to awards outstanding and expected to vest 
income tax benefits related to share based awards we recognize share based compensation expense based on an award s grant date fair value over the requisite service period 
because we do not know the actual amount of tax benefits an award will generate until such award is exercised or vested  we assume that the amount ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be the same amount we recognized in our operating results  that is for book purposes 
consequently  our deferred tax asset related to shared based compensation expense which totaled million as of february  is based on each qualifying award s grant date fair value rather than the award s to be determined exercise date intrinsic value or vesting date fair value 
historically  the difference between the grant date fair value and the exercise date intrinsic value has been significant 
as a result of such differences  for the years ending february   february  and february   we realized excess tax benefits related to share based awards totaling million  million and million respectively 
if the share price for our common stock were to depreciate for a sustained period of time we could be required to recognize a tax benefit shortfall 
such shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and to the extent such shortfalls accumulate in excess of approximately million our apic credit pool could materially  adversely impact our results of operations 
for further discussion  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note share based awards to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  we account for income taxes using the liability method in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of share based compensation expense deductions described above  tax credit carryforwards and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of february   deferred tax assets totaled million  of which million was offset by a valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for further discussion regarding deferred income taxes see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions in i calculating our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized 
for further discussion regarding uncertain tax positions see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the course of conducting our business  including losses related to legal proceedings and claims brought against us 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in evaluating both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a potential loss 
until the final resolution of a matter  there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded  and such amount could be material 
should any of our estimates or assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  it could have a material impact on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows

at february   we had total cash and investments of billion  which was comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  available for sale fixed income investments  million of available for sale equity securities  million of long term  available for sale fixed income investments  and million in deposit accounts with maturity dates greater than days 
this compares to total cash and investments of billion at february  with million in cash and cash equivalents on hand  we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances  together with our ability to generate additional cash from operations  should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
we presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long term investments in debt securities prior to their scheduled maturity dates 
however  in the event that we liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there are adverse changes in market interest rates or the overall economic environment  we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate 
at february  and february   accumulated unrealized losses on our available for sale debt securities totaled million and million  respectively 
at february  and february   accumulated unrealized gains related to our short term equity securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively

the increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in billings as we generally bill our customers in advance of subscription periods 
cash adjustments related to deferred income taxes of million was primarily due to share based compensation deductions which were in excess of amounts originally recognized in our consolidated statements of operations

investments in debt and equity securities our investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available for sale and recorded at their fair market values 
at february  and february   the vast majority of our investments were priced by pricing vendors 
these pricing vendors use the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or  if specific prices are not available for these securities  use other observable inputs 
in the event observable inputs are not available  we assess other factors to determine the securities market value  including broker quotes or model valuations 
independent price verifications of all of our holdings are performed by the pricing vendors  which we review 
in the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check  it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value 
capital requirements we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our enterprise technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors  including the amount of resources we devote to funding the continued development of our enterprise technology offerings  
table of contents accelerating the development of our systems management offerings  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers and support our business  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  investing in businesses  products and technologies  and investing in enhancements to the systems we use to run our business and the expansion of our office facilities  including capital expenditures related to our future headquarters facility discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading properties 
we have utilized  and will continue from time to time to utilize  cash and investments to fund  among other potential uses  purchases of our common stock  purchases of fixed assets  purchases of intellectual property and mergers and acquisitions 
given our historically strong operating cash flow and the billion of cash and investments held at february   we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations  either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt  in the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february  and february   we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at february  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total includes million in commitments related to our current headquarters facility and million in commitments related to a building we intend to use as our future headquarters facility 
for additional information  see our discussion in part i  item of this form k under the heading properties 
to the extent we cease to use any space in our current headquarters facility prior to the expiration of the lease term  we plan to sublease such space to a third party and anticipate that sublease income would offset existing contractual obligations 
however  to the extent we are unable to sublease or otherwise dispose of such space and recover the full amount of our existing contractual obligation  we would be required to recognize a loss 
obligations under contracts that we may cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above 
in addition  because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future payments related to uncertain tax positions  such liabilities are not included in the above table 
however  as of february   we have recognized a total of million related to such liabilities  which are included in other long term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or perceived credit risk related to the securities issuers 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of all interest rates  would result in an million change in annual interest income derived from investments in our portfolio as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note summary of significant accounting policies and note assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to the consolidated financial statements 
investment risk the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage change in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of all interest rates  would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note summary of significant accounting policies and note assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk the fair market values of our investment portfolio and cash balances are exposed to counterparty credit risk 
accordingly  while we periodically review our portfolio in an effort to mitigate counterparty risk  the principal values of our cash balances  money market accounts and investments in available for sale securities could suffer a loss of value 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the statements of operations of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
thus  to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency statements results in increased revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations decreases if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended february   our revenue and operating expenses from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been 
table of contents lower than we reported using the average exchange rates for our current fiscal year ending february  by approximately million and million  respectively  which would have resulted in income from operations being lower by million 
derivative instruments we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair market values in accordance with fasb asc section formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required to qualify its forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
for further discussion related to our management of foreign currency risk see note derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million 
the fair value of these outstanding contracts at february  was a gross million asset and a gross million liability  and is recorded in other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively on the consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts generally expire within three months of the period ended february  the forward contracts will settle in australian dollars  canadian dollars  czech koruna  euros  israeli shekels  japanese yen  mexican pesos  new zealand dollars  norwegian krona  singapore dollars  swedish krona  swiss francs and us dollars 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million 
the fair value of these outstanding contracts at february  was a gross million asset and a gross million liability  and is recorded in other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively on the consolidated balance sheets
