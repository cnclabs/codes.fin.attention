in january  we acquired nlasco 
nlasco was incorporated in delaware in but its origins trace back to through one of its subsidiaries  nlic 
in  c 
clifton robinson  who is currently the chairman of nlasco and a member of our board of directors  along with other investors  purchased nlic and moved its headquarters from san antonio  texas to waco  texas 
following various acquisitions and dispositions of equity in nlic by mr 
robinson and others  including the re acquisition of nlic along with the acquisition of asic in  mr 
robinson held of nlasco and its subsidiaries  nlic and asic  from until we acquired nlasco in on july   we sold substantially all of the operating assets used in our manufactured home communities business and our retail sales and financing business to american residential communities llc 
we received gross proceeds of approximately million in cash  which represents the aggregate purchase price of billion  less the indebtedness assumed by the buyer 
after giving effect to expenses  taxes and our continued outstanding preferred stock and senior notes  our net cash balance was approximately million 
we used a portion of the proceeds from this transaction for general working capital  liquidation of our operating partnership units and to repay certain outstanding obligations 
we intend to make opportunistic acquisitions with certain of the remaining proceeds from this transaction  and  if necessary or appropriate  from additional equity or debt financing sources

this line of credit will expire in october as of december   there was no outstanding balance on the note 
overview of results for the year ended december   net loss attributable to common stockholders was million  or per share  as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the year ended december   and a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the year ended december  segments nlasco operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries  nlic and asic 
given the homogenous nature of our products  the regulatory environments in which we operate  the nature of our customers and our distribution channels  we now monitor  control and manage our business lines as an integrated entity offering fire and homeowners insurance to low value dwellings and manufactured homes primarily in texas and other areas of the south  southeastern and southwestern united states 
accordingly  we only have insurance company segment information to disclose 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of  and for the year ended  december  we have summarized below those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
these estimates are based on information currently available to management and on various other assumptions management believes are reasonable 

table of contents losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported 
separately for each of nlic and asic and each line of business  our actuaries estimate the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  by first estimating ultimate losses and lae amounts for each year  prior to recognizing the impact of reinsurance 
there are several methods that our actuaries utilize to estimate ultimate loss and lae amounts  including paid loss development method  reported loss development method  paid bornhuetter ferguson method  and reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
paid and reported loss development methods 
insured losses for a given year change in value over time as additional information on claims are received  as claim conditions change and as new claims are reported 
this process is commonly referred to as loss development 
to project ultimate losses and lae  our actuaries examine the paid and reported paid  plus case losses and lae and multiply these values by a loss development factor 
the selected loss development factors are based upon a review of the loss development patterns indicated in the companies historical loss triangles and applicable insurance industry loss development factors 
paid and reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the bornhuetter ferguson  or bf  method is a procedure that weights an expected ultimate loss and lae amount  and the result of the loss development method 
this method is useful when loss data is immature or sparse because it is not as sensitive as the loss development method to unusual variations in the paid or reported amounts 
the bf method requires an initial estimate of expected ultimate losses and lae 
for each year  the expected ultimate losses and lae is based on a review of the ultimate loss ratios indicated in the companies historical data and applicable insurance industry ultimate loss ratios 
each loss development factor  paid or reported  implies a certain percent of the ultimate losses and lae is still unpaid or unreported 
the amounts of unpaid or unreported losses and lae by year are estimated as the percentage unpaid or unreported  times the expected ultimate loss and lae amounts 
to project ultimate losses and lae  the actual paid or reported losses and lae to date are added to the estimated unpaid or unreported amounts 
the results of each actuarial method performed by year are reviewed to select an ultimate loss and lae amount for each year 
in general  more weight is given to the loss development projections for more mature accident periods and more weight is given to the bf methods for less mature accident periods 
the combination of the methodologies described above is used for all lines of business  regardless of whether the line is a short tailed or long tailed line of business  though specific parameter selections within the methods vary to reflect the nature of the underlying line of business 
asic and nlic specialize in writing fire and extended coverage for low value dwellings  mobile homes and homeowners  which generally are considered short tailed coverages 
in addition  asic and nlic write a small amount of commercial risks  which are still predominantly property coverages  along with some low limit liability coverages 
the methodology used by our actuaries is directly dependent upon the unique development characteristics of each line of business 
for those lines of business with significant volume homeowners  special property and commercial multiple peril  the selected loss development factors are derived from the historical development data for that line 
for lines of business where the loss volume is small  insurance industry statistics regarding loss development for that line also are considered in selecting the loss development factors 
the estimated unpaid losses and lae equal the estimated ultimate loss and lae amounts  described above  less the cumulative paid amounts on known claims for each year 
this estimate of unpaid losses and lae is further segmented into case reserves on known claims and incurred but not reported  or ibnr  reserves 
ibnr reserves are calculated by reducing the estimate of unpaid losses and lae by the case reserve amounts 
in the normal course of operations  each case reserve is initially set at a standard amount determined from past payments for that type of loss 
individual case reserves may be adjusted based on information indicating that the loss amount is actually over  or under  the standard amount 
most case reserves are not adjusted until the receipt of documentation concerning the amount to be paid on the loss 
this usually occurs within seven days of the reporting of the claim  longer in the case of large scale catastrophic events 

table of contents the reserve analysis performed by our actuaries provides preliminary central estimates of the unpaid losses and lae 
at each quarter end  the results of the reserve analysis are summarized and discussed with our senior management 
the senior management group considers many factors in determining the amount of reserves to record for financial statement purposes 
these factors include the extent and timing of any recent catastrophic events  historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications  the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and reported loss patterns  the consistency of claims handling processes  the consistency of case reserving practices  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market 
our recorded reserves reflect our best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts  current law and our judgment 
the carried reserve may differ from the actuarial central estimate as the result of our consideration of the factors noted above  as well as other factors impacting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through actuarial analysis 
this process results in management s best estimate  which is then recorded as the reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
the level of loss and lae reserves we maintain represents our best estimate  as of a particular point in time  of the ultimate cost to settle and administer all claims based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time 
reserves are not an exact calculation of liability  but instead are complex estimates that we derive  generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques  with numerous underlying assumptions and expectations about future events  both internal and external  many of which are highly uncertain 
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve categories and accident years 
some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method  but many assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified 
an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid loss development method 
however  the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions  such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims 
loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims 
each reserve segment has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made 
as a result  the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions usually cannot be specifically quantified  and changes in these assumptions cannot generally be tracked over time 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates of ultimate losses and lae  and making the assumptions necessary to establish recorded reserve levels  we review our reserve estimates on a regular basis and make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is identified 
the anticipated future emergence underlying our current estimates continues to reflect the historical patterns  and the selected development patterns have not changed significantly over the past few years 
reserve estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation and economic conditions 
in estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and lae  it is necessary to project future loss and lae payments 
actual future losses and lae will not develop exactly as projected and may  in fact  vary significantly from the actuarially indicated projections 
further  these projections make no provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses  which are not sufficiently represented in the companies historical data or that are not yet quantifiable 
extraordinary future emergence can arise from an unforeseen broadening of coverage instigated by regulatory actions  judicial decisions or similar developments 
the underlying process of establishing our best estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and lae require the use of estimates  actuarial judgment and management considerations and  therefore  is an inherently uncertain process 
the recorded reserves for the companies liability for unpaid losses and lae are estimates based on long term averages 
actual loss experience in any given year may differ from what is suggested by these averages 
for some lines of business  the written premium volume is small and actual results are therefore subject to an exceptionally high degree of variability 
while the recorded reserves are our best estimate as of a particular point in time  these reserves should be considered best estimates within a wide range of possible outcomes 
in arriving at our best estimate of the unpaid losses and lae  and based on management discussion with our actuaries  we would consider reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions  such as the underlying loss development pattern or the expected loss ratio  to have an impact on our best estimate by 
as of december   this equates to approximately million  which represents approximately of equity and of calendar year losses 

table of contents the following table presents our gross loss and lae reserve amounts at december  and for each of nlic and asic by line of business dollars in thousands for the year ended december  company homeowners special property commercial multiple peril other liability all lines asic nlic consolidated for the year ended december  company homeowners special property commercial multiple peril other liability all lines asic nlic consolidated investment securities 
at december   investment securities consist of us government  mortgage backed  corporate debt and equity securities 
also included in our investment portfolio are other investments  which consist of a note receivable and warrants  held by the parent  hth 
we have the ability to categorize investments as trading  available for sale  and held to maturity 
we classify our fixed maturities as either available for sale or held to maturity and equity securities as available for sale 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
as of december   all securities were classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of trading and available for sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
we regularly review our investment securities to assess whether the security is impaired and if impairment is other than temporary 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we are more likely than not to hold an investment until a market price recovery and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to period end  and forecasted performance of the investee 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held to maturity or available for sale security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 

table of contents fair value measurements 
the company s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company s significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
based on management s understanding of the methodologies used by our pricing service  all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with gaap valuation principles 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
fixed maturities the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for its fixed maturities 
the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
since fixed maturities other than us treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications  which include available relevant market information  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
the extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions 
depending on the security  the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
for some securities  additional inputs may be necessary 
the pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation 
if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment  the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions 
the fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes 
accordingly  the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities  other than us treasury securities  provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the estimated fair value of us treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in level as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices 
the company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company s knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market 
in addition  the company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets 
these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service 
non fixed maturities and other investments equities public common and preferred for public common and preferred stocks  the company receives prices from a nationally recognized pricing service that are based on observable market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in level 
table of contents other investments the company holds investments in sws as a note receivable and warrants  which are reported in other investments 
the million fair value of these investments at december  was disclosed in level the fair value estimate is determined based on recent filings  operating results  balance sheet stability  growth and other business and market sector fundamentals 
due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations  the company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these investments at december  in the amount disclosed in level deferred acquisition costs 
costs of acquiring insurance vary with  and are related to  the production of new and renewal business  primarily consisting of commissions  premium taxes and underwriting expenses 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they relate 
proceeds from reinsurance transactions that represent recovery of acquisition costs reduce applicable unamortized acquisition costs in a manner that net acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to net revenue recognized 
future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs 
the company regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset 
a premium deficiency  and a corresponding charge to income  is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceed related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
at december   there was no premium deficiency 
revenue recognition 
property and liability premiums are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the policy term 
the portion of premiums that will be earned in the future are deferred and reported as unearned premiums 
the company routinely evaluates the premium receivable balance to determine if an allowance for uncollectible accounts is necessary 
other income consists of premium installment charges  which are recognized when earned  and other miscellaneous income 
reinsurance 
in the normal course of business  nlasco seeks to reduce losses that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
net premiums earned  losses and lae and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are reported net of the amounts related to reinsurance ceded to other companies 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers related to the portions of the liability for losses and lae are reported as assets 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reinsured policy 
the company accounts for reinsurance contracts under the provisions of gaap in accounting and reporting for reinsurance 
reinsurance assumed from other companies  including assumed premiums written and earned and losses and lae  is accounted for in the same manner as direct insurance written 
income taxes 
we have been in a taxable loss position since our inception and  as a result  we have substantial net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income and capital gains from the sale of discontinued operations 
we have established a tax provision beginning on january  income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects related to the temporary difference between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense included in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities 
asc  specifically  recognition  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we do not recognize any portion of the benefits in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets  including net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that any portion of these tax attributes will not be realized 
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be recognized 
in accordance with asc  the company considered all negative and positive evidence available including our cumulative pre tax loss position since the quarter ending december   less any abnormal occurrences during that period  
table of contents as well as future taxable income and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
we expect to realize our current deferred tax assets through core earnings  reversal of timing differences  and to the extent necessary  through the implementation of certain tax planning strategies surrounding the company s cash holdings 
therefore  the company concluded there was sufficient positive evidence to outweigh the negative evidence of the prior year cumulative losses 
there is no valuation allowance as of december  from time to time  management must assess the need to accrue or disclose a possible loss contingency for proposed adjustments from various federal  state and foreign tax authorities that regularly audit the company in the normal course of business 
in making these assessments  management often must analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
hth performs our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of each year 
management determined that hth has two reporting units  which are the parent the holding company and nlasco the insurance company 
goodwill for hth represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the assets of nlasco of million 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment but is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step step  used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the company has estimated fair values of reporting units based on a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach using historic  normalized actual and forecast results 
the discounted cash flow analysis utilizes thirty years of projected cash flows for the insurance company operations 
the projected financial results are created from critical assumptions and estimates based upon management s business plan and historical trends  while giving consideration to the overall economic environment 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments about appropriate discount rates  business growth rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and market information relevant to our overall company value 
the second step step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
next the company reviewed the intangible assets both definite and indefinite lived 
the definite lived intangibles relate to customer relationships  agency relationships  trade name and software 
we believe our customer relationships to be consistent with the value given to them based on the current renewal rate being approximately  slightly higher than when nlasco was purchased 
our agent relationships remain valuable and we have experienced less than turnover in our agent base since our trade names  nlic and asic  are both a rated companies with nlic increased from a in and asic in our internally developed software  pacs  is still the main operating system of the company 
at december   we determined that the estimated fair value of nlasco exceeded its carrying values and  therefore  we did not perform the second step as described above 
our fair value exceeded carrying value by as of december  consequently  we determined that no impairment existed with respect to goodwill and intangible assets at december  the goodwill impairment analysis is subject to impact from uncertainties arising from such events as changes in economic or competitive conditions  the current general economic environment  material changes in the weather and hard and soft markets within the insurance industry that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows  and the impact of strategic decisions 
if any of these factors were to material change it may require a reevaluation of our goodwill

primary uses of cash include payments of claims  operating expenses and income taxes  funds to service million of debt and purchases of investments 
nlasco s insurance subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can declare 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows from operations and dividends from our insurance companies  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs for the reasonably foreseeable future 
we will continue to pursue and investigate possible strategic opportunities 
in that regard  we may need to secure external financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing or in the implementation of our business plan

risk factors starting on page restrictions on dividends and distributions aside from available cash and investment income on our invested assets  as a holding company we rely on dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends from our insurance subsidiaries  nlic and asic  is subject to significant regulatory restrictions and limitations under debt agreements limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
under texas state insurance law for property and casualty companies  all dividends must be distributed out of earned surplus only 
furthermore  without the prior approval of the commissioner  dividends cannot be declared or distributed that exceed the greater of ten percent of the company s surplus  as shown by its last statement on file with the commissioner  or one hundred percent of net income for such period 
the subsidiaries paid no dividends to nlasco in  million in march and no dividends in at december   the maximum dividend that may be paid to nlasco in without regulatory approval is approximately million 
regulations of the texas department of insurance require insurance companies to maintain minimum levels of statutory surplus to ensure their ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
at december   nlasco s insurance subsidiaries had statutory surplus in excess of the minimum required 
also  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital  or rbc  requirements for insurance companies that establish minimum capital requirements relating to insurance risk  credit risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the formula is used by the naic and certain state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify companies that require additional scrutiny or regulatory action 
at december   the company s insurance subsidiaries rbc ratio exceeded the level at which regulatory action would be required 
we believe that restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies will not have a material impact on our ability to carry out our normal business activities  including debt payments on our senior exchangeable notes

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december  our total debt outstanding was million  comprised of approximately million of indebtedness subject to fixed interest rates 
approximately million  or  of our total consolidated debt is variable rate debt 
if libor and the prime rate were to increase by one eighth of one percent  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately  annually 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
the fair value of debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million
