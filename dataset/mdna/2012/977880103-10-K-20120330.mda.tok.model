item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at december   we had total assets of million  compared to total assets of million at december  during the year ended december   we had net income of million 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we incur on our deposits and  to a lesser extent  our borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by service charges and other fees  provision for loan losses  gains on sales of loans originated for sale and other income 
our noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  net occupancy and equipment expense  information technology  professional and services fees  fdic deposit insurance and other real estate owned expense 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  as well as changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
historically  substantially all of our loans have been collateralized by real estate and at december  and  one to four family residential mortgage loans including home equity loans and lines of credit  commercial real estate loans including multifamily loans and land loans and construction loans  comprised and  of our total loan portfolio  respectively 

table of contents we do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his or her loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we generally do not offer subprime loans loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers that have had payment delinquencies  previous loan charge offs  judgments and bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt burden ratios or alt a loans generally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
business strategy our business strategy is to remain a profitable  community oriented financial institution offering deposit and loan products to retail and business customers in our primary market area 
additionally  we are seeking to expand our presence in new markets 
we were established in and have operated continuously in the great lakes bay region of michigan since that date 
we are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate  and we are dedicated to providing quality personal service to our customers 
we offer a broad range of financial services to consumers and businesses from our four banking offices and one loan center 
our business strategy includes the following elements growing our loan portfolio by continuing to emphasize the origination of commercial and residential real estate loans  including increasing our loan participations  while maintaining strong asset quality 
at december   commercial real estate loans  including multifamily loans and land loans  comprised of our total loan portfolio 
these loans generally are higher yielding than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and also generally have a shorter term than our one to four family residential mortgage loans which helps our interest rate risk management 
we intend to continue to make these types of loans a significant part of our total loan portfolio 
we currently participate with other community banks that serve as the lead lender in commercial mortgage loans  one to four family residential mortgage loans and commercial non mortgage loans collateralized by properties that are located both within and outside of our primary market area 
we intend to increase the amount of our loan participations in an effort to continue to grow our loan portfolio 
however  we still apply our prudent underwriting standards to any potential participation loan and this is causing slow growth in our participation loan portfolio 
maintaining prudent underwriting standards and aggressively monitoring our loan portfolio to maintain asset quality 
we introduce loan products only when we are confident that our staff has the necessary expertise to originate and administer such loans  and that sound underwriting and collection procedures are in place 
our goal is to continue to improve our asset quality through prudent underwriting standards and the diligence of our loan collection personnel 
at december   our ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 
at december   our ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was  and our ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 
reducing our overall cost of funds by emphasizing lower cost core deposits  including low cost public funds from municipalities  townships and non profit organizations and reducing our borrowings 
we offer interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts collectively referred to as core deposits  which generally are lower cost sources of funds than certificates of deposit  and are less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
at december   of our total deposits consisted of these lower cost core deposits compared to and of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
additionally  at december  we held approximately million of low cost checking and money market account funds from michigan cities  townships  counties and nonprofit organizations which we call public funds due  we believe  to our successful marketing efforts  community ties  and 
table of contents financial stability and strength 
we intend to continue emphasizing our core deposits  including public funds  as a source of funds 
additionally  we intend to reduce our borrowings from the fhlb of indianapolis 
with respect to our commercial real estate customers  we encourage commercial banking borrowers to open checking accounts with us at the time they establish a borrowing relationship with us  and we intend to continue to pursue this strategy to grow this source of lower cost deposits 
managing interest rate risk 
successfully managing interest rate risk is  and will continue to be  an integral part of our business strategy 
management and the board of directors evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  and determine the level of risk that is appropriate and consistent with our capital levels  liquidity and performance objectives 
in particular  during the current low interest rate environment  we have sought to minimize the risk of originating long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans by originating such loans for sale in the secondary market and  in particular  selling substantially all of our conforming fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans with terms of years or greater 
in addition  a significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate mortgage loans which generally have shorter terms and provide higher yields than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
we also monitor the mix of our deposits 
our strategy is to continue managing interest rate risk in response to changes in the local and national economy 
expanding our banking franchise 
we currently operate from four banking offices and one loan center 
we intend to evaluate additional branch expansion opportunities through acquisitions and de novo branching 
in addition  we intend to evaluate acquisitions of other financial institutions  or the deposits and assets of other institutions  including in fdic assisted acquisitions  as opportunities present themselves although we currently have no understandings or agreements to acquire other banks  thrifts  branches thereof or other financial services companies 
the successful implementation of these strategies will allow us to offer our clients a broad range of financial products and services 
our goal is to have full relationship banking with our clients 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income  to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses are particularly susceptible to change in the near term  due to changes in credit quality which are evidenced by trends in charge offs and in the volume and severity of past due loans 
in addition  our portfolio is comprised of a substantial amount of commercial real estate loans which generally have greater credit risk than one to four family residential mortgage and consumer loans because these loans generally have larger principal balances and are non homogenous 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level to cover probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance for loan losses required  we record a provision for loan losses as a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level 
the estimate of our credit losses is applied to two general categories of loans loans that we evaluate individually for impairment under asc  receivables  and groups of loans with similar risk characteristics that we evaluate collectively for impairment under asc  loss contingencies 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and reflects consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio 
the factors used to evaluate the collectability of the loan portfolio include  but are not limited to  current economic conditions  our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the financial strength of the borrower  and estimated value of any underlying collateral 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are subject to significant revision as more information becomes available 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
see also business of wolverine bank allowance for loan losses 
income tax accounting 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on our income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under us gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  our forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carryback years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
any required valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability  which could adversely affect our future income tax expense 
we believe our tax policies and practices are critical accounting policies because the determination of our tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact on our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we believe our tax liabilities and assets are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december  and and no valuation allowance was necessary 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of paying off maturing federal home loan bank advances and decreases in certificate of deposit liabilities and interest earning demand deposits all resulting in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  offset by an increase in net loans 

table of contents interest earning demand deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in interest earning demand deposits was primarily due to the result of the net activity between the decrease in deposit liabilities  paying off maturing federal home loan bank advances and funding loan growth 
interest earning time deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  reflecting normal cash management 
net loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  as our one to four family residential mortgage loans decreased by million  to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to repayments and refinances 
we do not hold significant fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans in our portfolio especially at this time of historic low interest rates 
additionally  land loans decreased million to million from million and commercial non mortgage loans decreased million  to million from million 
these items were offset by increases in multifamily loans of million  or  to million  from million at december  the majority of the million consists of five multifamily loans that were opened in that totaled million at december  we had an increase in construction loans of million  or  to million  from million and in commercial real estate of million  or  to million from million 
during  we opened three significant construction loans and four significant commercial real estate loans  which totaled million and million  respectively  at december  securities held to maturity  consisting of one municipal security at december   decreased  to  at december  from  at december  real estate owned decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in other real estate owned resulted from write downs of  and sales of million offset by new foreclosures of million  primarily composed of three commercial mortgage properties totaling  and three to family properties totaling  of the million in sales of other real estate owned  million came from one relationship which was foreclosed on in late other assets  consisting primarily of prepaid fdic assessments and deferred federal taxes  decreased  or  to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred taxes 
deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  our core deposits consisting of interest bearing and noninterest bearing checking accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  we believe the increase in our core deposits resulted primarily from continuing to build relationships with our existing customers as well as our marketing efforts with new customers 
federal home loan bank advances decreased million to million at december  from million at december  as a result of paying off maturing advances 

table of contents total stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from our initial public offering net proceeds of million which closed on january   and net income of million during the year ended the gross proceeds were million which were netted against an unearned esop of million and offering expenses of million 
we also released shares from our esop which increased our total stockholder equity by  in comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
we recorded net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  the net income for is primarily due to the fact that our provision for loan loss expense for was million  a decrease of million or as compared to also  our interest expense decreased million  or  to million in as compared to million in our net loss during the period resulted primarily from a million provision for loan losses charge taken during and a one time charge of million taken in connection with the freezing and funding of our multi employer defined benefit pension plan 
interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as the average balance of interest earning assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to during from during the decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets was due primarily to the general decline in market interest rates 
the biggest component decrease in average interest earning assets was in other interest earning assets  which decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the average yield on other interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was offset by an increase in the average balance of total net loans of million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as the average yield on net loans decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  reflecting the lower market interest rate environment 
interest income on investment securities  other interest earning assets and fhlb of indianapolis stock decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this includes interest income on interest earning demand deposits  interest earning time deposits and held to maturity securities 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as the average balance of interest bearing liabilities decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and the average rate we paid on these liabilities decreased basis points to from 
the biggest component decrease was in interest expense on certificates of deposit which decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   
table of contents resulting from a million decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposits to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   and a basis point decrease in the cost of these funds to for from for the average balance of our core deposits  consisting of checking accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and the interest on core deposits decreased  to  for from  for the cost of these funds decreased basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  interest expense on borrowed funds  consisting entirely of federal home loan bank advances  decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as our average balance of these borrowings decreased million and the average rate paid decreased basis points to from 
throughout the year of  we paid off million worth of maturing federal home loan bank advances 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we restructured million of outstanding advances under the federal loan home bank of indianapolis blend and extend program  costing with a weighted average maturity of months to with a weighted average remaining maturity of months 
we have another million of federal home loan bank advances maturing in which will be paid off 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as our net interest earning assets increased to million from million  our net interest rate spread increased basis points to from and our net interest margin increased basis points to from 
the increases in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin reflected our ongoing interest rate risk strategy of selling in the secondary market long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans during the current low interest rate environment  a shift from lower yielding interest earning demand deposits to interest earning time deposits and loans  paying off and restructuring federal home loan bank advances and a shift from higher costing certificate of deposit liabilities to core deposits 
provision for loan losses 
based on our analysis of the factors described in critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  and a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the factors used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance and provision for loan losses of the loan portfolio include  but are not limited to  current economic conditions  our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the financial strength of the borrower  and estimated value of any underlying collateral 
at december   non performing assets totaled million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  the increase in non performing assets was primarily in the land loan portfolio  a higher risk portfolio compared to our one to four family residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable decreased to at december  from at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans decreased to at december  from at december   while our non performing loans increased by million from december  to december  primarily due to one relationship which moved to non performing status  but is adequately collateralized 
to the best of our knowledge  we have provided for all losses that are both incurred and reasonable to estimate at december  and 
table of contents of the million loan relationship that was moved to non performing status as of june   approximately is collateralized by developed commercial land and approximately is collateralized by developed residential single family lots and three single family homes built on speculation 
the entire relationship is cross collateralized and all of these properties are located within michigan 
it has been rated substandard for over two years and has been specifically reviewed for impairment for that entire period 
therefore  we believe that our allowance for loan loss is adequate as of december  all loans rated substandard are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly 
the specific allowance for this relationship was increased from  to  as o june  we have maintained regular communications with the borrower regarding monthly payments and financial performance  with the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial workout strategy 
overall  management continues to focus on resolving nonperforming assets and improving asset quality 
in addition to our collections department personnel  in working out loans  we continue to involve business development officers and  on significant assets  underwriters and senior management 
noninterest income 
noninterest income decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease of  on net gains on loan sales  a decrease of  on net gain loss on sale of other real estate owned and a decrease of  on gross income on other real estate owned 
these items were offset by a  settlement of an insurance claim made under our financial institution bond 
this settlement relates to an expense we incurred in connection with an external wire transfer in june noninterest expense 
noninterest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to a million decrease in salaries and related expenses due to a million charge we incurred in june in connection with the freezing and funding of our multi employer defined benefit pension plan 
we also had a decrease of  resulting from an expense we incurred in connection with an external wire transfer fraud in excluding these one time charges incurred in  noninterest expense would have increased by  income tax expense benefit 
we recorded a  income tax expense for the year ended december  compared to a million income tax benefit for  reflecting the income of million before income tax expense during the year ended december  versus the loss of million before income tax benefit during the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  asset quality at december   we had loans  totaling  for which we had temporarily extended the maturities while working on the loan renewal process 
during the renewal process  the borrowers continue repayment according to the original loan terms which are at market interest rates 
of these loans  one loan for  was classified as substandard and one loan for  was considered special mention 
at december   none of these loans was considered a troubled debt restructuring because none of these extensions were made due to financial difficulties of the borrower  and all of these loans were considered performing at december  
table of contents average balances and yields the following tables set forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information for the periods indicated 
tax equivalent yield adjustments have not been made for tax exempt securities 
all average balances are based on month end balances which management deems to be representative of the operations of wolverine bank 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield

the rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume 
the volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate 
the net column represents the sum of the prior columns 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated to the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of change in each

because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than our interest earning assets 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an internal asset liability management committee pursuant to our interest rate risk management policy that is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model which reports the cumulative and noncumulative interest rate risk gap and generates estimates of the change in our net interest income 
the modeling assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and new volumes based on historical experience and current economic conditions 

table of contents we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i sell the majority of our long term  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans that we originate  ii lengthen the weighted average maturity of our liabilities through retail deposit pricing strategies and through longer term wholesale funding sources such as fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  iii invest in shorter to medium term investment securities and interest earning time deposits  iv originate commercial mortgage loans  including multi family loans and land loans  commercial loans and consumer loans  which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and which generate customer relationships that can result in larger noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  and v maintain adequate levels of capital 
net portfolio value 
the office of the comptroller of currency requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
previously  the office of thrift supervision provided all institutions that filed a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of net portfolio value 
institutions are now required to develop their own rate sensitivity analysis report  or contract with a third party vendor who specializes in the analysis of interest rate risk analysis 
wolverine bank will be utilizing thomas ho company to analyze interest rate risk sensitivity 
the thomas ho company model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
the thomas ho company model estimates the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption of instantaneous rate increases or decreases of to basis points in basis point increments 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in rates column below 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of december  the calculation of the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from the designated immediate changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
at december  change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would experience a increase in net portfolio value 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  we would experience a decrease in net portfolio value 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value 
modeling changes in net portfolio value require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value tables presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net portfolio value tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan sales and repayments  advances from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  and maturities of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
for the year ended december   our liquidity ratio averaged of our total assets 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of december  we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows  iii yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and iv the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and medium term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are affected by our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
interest earning time deposits which can offer additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at december  our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our statements of cash flows included in our financial statements 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  including million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of total deposits 
of this amount  approximately million were paying above market rates at a weighted average yield of 
these certificates were originated under our three year guaranteed upward repricing certificate of deposit product  and the corresponding higher interest rates reflect the higher market interest rate environment at the time that these deposits were originated 
it is not our intention to pay above market rates to keep these deposits upon maturity  and we are uncertain as to what amount of these deposits we will be able to retain 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we may be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december   although we would expect to pay lower rates on certificates which are maturing and which will either not renew or will renew at market rates 
additionally  the additional capital that we raised in our stock offering which closed in january provided additional liquidity 
moreover  it is our intention as we continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio  to emphasize lower cost deposit relationships with these commercial customers and thereby replace the higher cost certificates with lower cost deposits 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activity is originating loans 
during the years ended december  and  we originated million and million of loans  respectively 

table of contents financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we had a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended december  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of indianapolis  which provides an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank advances were million at december   a decrease of million from december  federal home loan bank advances have been used primarily to fund loan demand 
at december   we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis and had additional fed funds purchase limits of million with three correspondent banks 
wolverine bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   wolverine bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
wolverine bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see supervision and regulation federal banking regulation capital requirements and note regulatory matters of the notes to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the net proceeds from our stock offering which closed in january significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources 
over time  the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes  including the funding of new loans 
we believe our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  resulting in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income 
however  due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the stock offering  our return on equity will be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
for additional information  see note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include data processing services  operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities
