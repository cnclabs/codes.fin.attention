our development and commercialization efforts in various diagnostic areas include noninvasive women s health related and prenatal diagnostics  ophthalmology  and other medical conditions such as oncology  infectious diseases and autoimmunity 
our proprietary massarray system is comprised of hardware  software applications  and consumable chips and reagents 
it is a high performance in speed  accuracy  and cost efficiency nucleic acid analysis research use only platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations 
our system is widely accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system for genotyping  somatic mutation analysis and fine mapping markets and continues to gain traction for applications  such as agricultural genomics and clinical research 
our research customers include premier clinical research laboratories  bioagriculture  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  and various government agencies worldwide 
to provide customer support for our expanding user base  and in an effort to maximize market penetration  we have established direct sales and support employees serving north america  europe and asia  in addition to utilizing sales and distribution partners in several major countries throughout the world 
we are committed to researching  developing  and pursuing the commercialization of various noninvasive molecular diagnostic tests for prenatal genetic disorders and diseases  women s health related disorders and diseases  ophthalmology  and other medical conditions such as oncology  infectious diseases and autoimmunity 
currently  we are primarily focused on developing and commercializing prenatal diagnostic tests using our foundational  patent protected  noninvasive  circulating cell free fetal  or ccff  nucleic acid based assay technology  which we in license from isis innovation limited  or isis 
this technology uses a maternal blood sample for a prenatal diagnosis or risk assessment in order to provide reliable information about the presence  amount  or absence of fetal genetic material in early pregnancy 
we have branded our technology for prenatal diagnostics under the trademark sequredx 
our efforts in molecular diagnostics are focused on developing noninvasive in vitro diagnostic tests using our proprietary massarray system and or nucleic acid sequencing platforms currently provided by illumina  inc we plan to execute the development  validation  and other activities necessary to file submissions with the us food and drug administration  or fda  seeking clearance or approval for commercialization in the united states of certain of our in vitro diagnostic tests where we believe it will afford us competitive advantages to do so  such as providing us with the flexibility to sell the test as an fda cleared ivd kit to other laboratories  and an alternative in the event the fda decides to exercise its enforcement jurisdictional authority with respect to regulation of laboratory developed tests  or ldts  as in vitro diagnostics 
historically  the fda has exercised enforcement discretion and exempted from regulation ldts  but the fda has stated that additional regulation of ldts may be warranted 
in we submitted a pre investigational device exemption submission and supplements to the fda for an in vitro diagnostic test for fetal chromosome aneuploidy  such as trisomy  and have met with the fda to discuss our proposed preclinical and clinical study designs 
we have invested substantially in sequenom center for molecular medicine  llc  or sequenom cmm s information technology infrastructure to enhance the capabilities of the laboratories to track samples and provide electronic ordering and reporting and have put in place sample collection and transportation logistics that can be scaled as demand for sequenom cmm s molecular diagnostic testing services increases 
currently  we offer pricing on our diagnostic tests that address the following general parameters insured patients have established maximum out of pocket costs with the payor being billed at the full list price and any outstanding amounts due are pursued from the payor  not the patient  on appeal 
uninsured patients are billed using a separately maintained price list 
due to our current out of network provider status associated with the lack of existing contracts with payors and the current level of adoption rates in particular with our ldts for age related macular degeneration  or amd  and maternit plus  we expect billed amounts will fluctuate until these factors are resolved 
sequenom cmm intends to provide reimbursement recommendations and enter into contracts with third party payors to establish contractual pricing for its ldts 

table of contents our massarray system provides reliable results for a wide range of dna rna analysis applications  including single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  genotyping  detection of mutations  analysis of copy number variants  and other structural genome variations 
in addition  the system provides quantitative gene expression analysis  quantitative dna methylation analysis  comparative sequence analysis of haploid organisms  snp discovery  and oligonucleotide quality control 
these applications are provided through proprietary research use application software that operates on the massarray system and through the purchase of consumable chips and reagent sets 
while the massarray system is versatile across many applications  it is a robust and cost effective genotyping and somatic mutation analysis solution enabled through our research use only iplex multiplexing assay  which permits multiplexed snp and somatic mutation analysis 
in april we launched our next generation research use only mass spectrometry system  the massarray analyzer this high performance nucleic acid analysis system has been designed to meet customer demand for a bench top instrument with greater flexibility across multiple applications  improved reliability and faster performance  and is designed to empower the basic and translational research community to advance findings from discovery genetic and biomarker studies toward biomarker validation and potential clinical utility in diagnosis  prognosis and monitoring of diseases 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping  performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis in the molecular medicine market 
epigenetic analysis is an important part of cancer and other research areas 
dna methylation analysis is the most frequently studied epigenetic change  and examines changes in the presence or absence of methyl groups in specific areas of the dna 
we are targeting customers for our genetic analysis technology and products across five segments oncology and translational research  pharmaceutical research  academic biomedical research  agricultural  and clinical research  public health initiatives  and biodefense 
we believe the market and opportunities for growth for fine mapping genotyping are increasing as more researchers are completing their larger genomic studies such as whole genome scans 
epigenetic analysis is an emerging market that  along with gene expression analysis  is increasingly being utilized by researchers in conjunction with genotyping to attempt to fully understand genetic cause and effect 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  contract research services  and sequenom cmm testing services 
the impact of our product offerings  contract research services and sequenom cmm testing services on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
sequenom cmm s testing services for amd and trisomy genotyping have only recently been launched and demand for and acceptance of these tests by physicians and their patients is uncertain  and the level of reimbursement of all ldts is also uncertain 
as a result  expected revenues from sequenom cmm s testing services are uncertain and difficult to predict 
such revenues are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   and we expect to incur further losses for the foreseeable future 
our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect 
table of contents amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and conditions are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
the estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an assessment that falls within the range of reasonable estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
genetic analysis product sales and services revenue primarily consists of sales of system instrumentation and consumables used in genetic analysis  including extended warranty services associated with the instrumentation as well as other amounts earned under contract research agreements 
diagnostic services revenues consist of performing ldts for cystic fibrosis  or cf  carrier screening  fetal rhesus d  or rhd  genotyping  amd  and maternit plus 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days or less are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer and when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
we adopted the standard and  effective as of january   when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations  or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we evaluate deliverables in a multiple element arrangement to determine whether each represents a separate unit of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value to the customer and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements 
items are considered to have standalone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could sell the item on a standalone basis 
in instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit 
allocation of the consideration is determined by management at the arrangement inception on the basis of each unit s relative selling price 

table of contents we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and  in rare instances  using the price established by management having the relevant authority 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product or service on a stand alone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price 
due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry  we have not established selling price using third party evidence 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we determine our best estimate of selling price 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
the best estimate of selling price is established considering internal factors such as historical selling prices  pricing practices and controls  and customer segment pricing strategies 
diagnostic revenues from sequenom cmm have been recognized on a cash basis due to the lack of contractual reimbursement agreements with third party payors and limited collections experience 
we generally bill third party payors upon generation and delivery of a report to the physician 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and risk of collection with the third party payor 
insured patients have established maximum out of pocket costs with the payor being billed at the full list price and any outstanding amounts due are pursued from the payor  not the patient  on appeal 
some payors may not cover our test as ordered by the physician under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we pursue case by case reimbursement where policies are not in place 
we will continue to recognize revenue upon cash collection until we can reliably estimate the amount that will be ultimately collected 
accounts receivable we invoice our genetic analysis product sales and services as orders are shipped and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts typically require payment within to days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends  and changes in client payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we bill third party payors for our ldts upon providing test results to ordering physicians 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with third party payors and we continue to monitor the collection history for third party payors 
we do not record accounts receivable for billings to third party payors as these revenues are recognized on a cash basis 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
for billings directly to physician officers or to uninsured patients  we continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows goodwill and impairment of intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our goodwill and long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of goodwill and long lived assets was recorded in   or allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balance based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review the historical loss rates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles  including expiration 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance against our us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold 

table of contents we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
stock based compensation 
we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of share based awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price  expected life of an award  expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate 
we amortize the fair value of share based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued an asu related to testing goodwill for impairment that gives companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
under this guidance  only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount are we required to perform the two step test 
otherwise  we can skip the two step test 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we have early adopted this guidance and performed the qualitative assessment during our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
in april  the fasb issued an asu related to revenue recognition that applies to arrangements with milestones relating to research or development deliverables 
this guidance provides criteria that must be met to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
the update was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect to receive any significant milestone revenue from our current license and collaboration agreements 
in january  the fasb issued an asu related to fair value measurements and disclosures that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
the new and revised disclosures are required to be implemented in interim or annual periods beginning after december   except for the gross presentation of the level rollforward  which was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued an asu related to revenue recognition that amends the previous guidance on arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance provides principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
it also clarifies the method to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price 
the update was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued an asu related to the presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present items of net income and other comprehensive income  or oci  and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but continuous statements 
we will no longer be allowed to present oci in the statement of stockholders equity 
earnings per share would continue to be based on net income 
although existing guidance related to items that must be presented in oci has not changed  companies will be required to display reclassification adjustments for each component of oci in both net income and oci 
also  companies will need to present the components of other comprehensive income in their interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance is required to be implemented retrospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december   which will be our fiscal year the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an asu related to fair value measurements and disclosures that clarified and amended the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified the intent of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the new and revised disclosures are required to be implemented prospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december   which will be our fiscal year early application is not permitted 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues genetic analysis product sales and services revenues were derived from sales of consumables  including our spectrochip arrays used with our iplex and other assays  massarray systems  maintenance agreements  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  and contract research services 
diagnostic revenues were primarily from the sale of sequenom cmm s cf and rhd ldts 
collections from the sale of sequenom cmm s amd and maternit ldts were not significant for the periods presented due to commencement of their commercialization in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
years ended december  change change genetic analysis product sales and services in thousands diagnostic services in thousands total revenues 
table of contents the increase in our genetic analysis product sales and services revenues is primarily attributable to our larger installed base of massarray systems against the comparative period  which resulted in increased consumables orders from our customers in the translational research and agricultural biology markets against the comparative period which resulted in an increase of consumables revenues to million from million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
contract research services increased to million from million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in system sales to million from million primarily due to a decrease in the number of massarray systems sold during the current period as compared to the same period in diagnostic services revenue is recognized upon cash collection as payments are received 
the increase in our diagnostic revenue is attributable to an increase in the number of tests performed during the year ended december   compared to the same period in domestic and non us revenues were million and million for the year ended december   respectively  and million and million for the year ended december   respectively 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period and likely will continue to fluctuate substantially in the future based upon the unpredictable sales cycle for the massarray system  general economic conditions  revenue recognition criteria  the overall acceptance and demand for our new and existing commercial products and services  as well as the adoption rates of our maternit plus ldt  cystic fibrosis carrier screening  rhesus d genotyping  and amd tests  as well as future tests 
cost of genetic analysis product sales and services and diagnostic services revenues and gross margins gross margin consists of our revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of employee related costs salaries  bonuses  fringe benefits  and stock based compensation of our laboratory and manufacturing personnel  and other support personnel  as well as outside laboratory costs  laboratory and manufacturing supplies  logistic costs  depreciation  and administrative related costs allocated to cost of revenues 
years ended december  change change gross margin in thousands gross margin of revenues cost of genetic analysis product sales and services for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of genetic analysis product sales and services revenues for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in the increase is due to product mix  including increased consumables  which typically have higher margins  as well as higher gross margin on systems sales related to a higher average selling price and a decrease in low margin spare parts replacements 
costs of diagnostic services revenues are recognized upon providing test results to ordering physicians and were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of diagnostic services revenues was negative for the years ended december  and due to revenue being recognized when cash is received  costs incurred in one period may relate to revenue recognized in a later period 
gross margin on diagnostic tests were affected by test volumes  cash collected during the period  overall reimbursement for the amount paid per test  and laboratory operational costs 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will fluctuate on a quarterly basis and be affected by  among other things  the selling price for systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of product sales and the type of services  competitive conditions  sales volumes  discounts offered  sales 
table of contents through distributors  as well as the cost of goods sold  inventory reserves and obsolescence charges required  and royalty payment obligations on in licensed technologies 
our gross margin will also be affected by the adoption rates of our diagnostic tests  the levels of reimbursement  and payor and other contracts we may enter into for our tests

litigation settlement litigation settlement expense  net was and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with the court approved settlement of in re sequenom  inc securities litigation in may  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million related to the common stock issuable to the members of the plaintiffs class 
this settlement consisted of approximately million shares at an initial fair value of per share 
in addition  further adjustments to the equity based portion of the settlement were required to be recognized as a gain or loss depending upon fluctuations in the fair market value of our common stock from the initial settlement fair value until all common stock issuable to the members of the plaintiffs class had been released 
subsequent to the initial accrual  we recognized an additional net aggregate loss of approximately million due to the revaluation to fair value for the portion of the approved share settlement issued to plaintiffs counsel in august and the revaluation to fair value for the remaining shares that were issued to the members of the plaintiffs class on december  additionally  in connection with the entry of a stipulation of settlement in connection with in re sequenom  inc derivative litigation in may  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million during the second quarter of this charge represented the portion of the settlement not covered by insurance proceeds 
in connection with the final approval of the settlement we remitted a cash payment of  and issued  shares of our common stock at a fair value of per share in august interest income interest income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to the overall reduction in the rates of return in our investment portfolios and varying levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during  as compared to the same period in gain loss on marketable securities gain on marketable securities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to a net realizable loss attributable to fluctuations in the market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities and fair value measurements the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk our current investment policy requires us to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities that are represented by issuances from the us government  repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities that have ratings of aaa or are fully guaranteed by the us government 
our investment policy also includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments and the overall amount that may be invested with a single security 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
the appropriate classification of marketable securities is determined at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
based on this determination  as of december  and  all of our investments in marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were reported at fair value 
we measure fair value based on the prices that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness  credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity 
declines in fair value that are considered other than temporary are charged to operations and those that are considered temporary are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we use the specific identification method of determining the cost basis in computing realized and unrealized gains and losses on the sale of our available for sale securities 

table of contents foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign operations whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp  the japanese yen yen  and the euro eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the united states dollar usd using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the usd 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities functional currency of operations aud eur usd a movement of in the usd to aud exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the usd dollar to eur exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we do not believe that a movement in the exchange rate between the usd and the gbp  the yen  or any other foreign currencies  to which we are exposed  respectively  would have a material impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december    or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
