item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our fiscal year typically includes weeks  comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter 
every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or rd week in the fourth quarter 
fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks 
description of the business we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with a share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending  and the second largest pizza company in the world  based on number of units 
we also have a leading international presence 
we operate through a network of company owned stores  all of which are in the united states  and  franchise stores located in all states and in more than international markets 
in addition  we operate regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and company owned stores 
changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts 
we monitor both of these metrics very closely  as they directly impact our revenues and profits  and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts 
retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees as well as company owned store and supply chain revenues 
retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino s pizza brand  the results of our marketing promotions  our ability to execute our store operating model  the overall global economic environment and the success of our business strategies 
we devote significant attention to our brand building efforts  which is evident in our system s estimated billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age 
we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino s pizza brand 
in  pizza today  the leading publication of the pizza industry  named domino s its chain of the year for the second straight year making the company a three time overall winner of the honor  and the first pizza delivery company to receive the honor in back to back years 
we also pay particular attention to the store economics  or the investment performance of a store to its owner  of both our franchise and company owned stores 
we believe that our system s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino s pizza store 
we believe these favorable investment requirements  coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending  as well as high quality and focused menu offerings  drive strong store economics  which  in turn  drive demand for new stores 
business performance during  the company continued to produce strong results both domestically and internationally 
during fiscal  domestic same store sales rose which was rolling over a very strong same store sales growth in the results in demonstrate sustained improvement in our domestic business due to higher customer satisfaction  retention and purchase frequency 
over the past several years  our focus domestically has been improving our company through several initiatives  including investments to improve upon our menu  marketing  technology  operations and franchise base 
our menu improvements included launching new product platforms in the united states such as our improved pizza recipe launched in late  domino s oven baked sandwiches  domino s american legends pizzas  domino s breadbowl pasta  chocolate lava crunch cakes and in  our improved boneless chicken and wings  domino s artisan pizzas and our new stuffed cheesy bread 
we believe our new product platforms combined with an innovative  transparent and effective advertising campaign  continued focus on operational excellence and new technology  such as the launch of our iphone and ipod touch mobile applications in  generated strong sales and earnings growth for the company in both and our international division continued to post strong same store sales growth in and had a record net store openings  including net stores in india  net stores in turkey and net stores in the united kingdom 
continued strong same store sales growth combined with continued store count growth  demonstrate the consistency and reliability of this growing business segment 

table of contents these strong results from both our domestic and international stores produced earnings per share growth and increased cash flows in we believe that our franchise business model continues to provide a solid structure on which to build consistent retail sales and store growth that results in strong cash flows that we can deploy to drive shareholder value 
in  global retail sales  which are total retail sales at company owned and franchise stores worldwide  increased as compared to retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues 
this increase was driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in our worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters  and  the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 
domestic same store sales growth reflected the sustained improvement in our domestic business due to the continued success of our new products and promotions 
international same store sales growth reflected continued strong performance in the markets where we compete 
in  global retail sales increased as compared to  driven primarily by both domestic and international same store sales growth  growth in worldwide store counts  and  to a lesser extent  the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 
these increases were offset in part by the inclusion of the rd week in  which benefited global retail sales by percentage points in our revenues increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in revenues in was driven primarily by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from higher cheese and other commodity prices and higher international revenues attributable to same store sales  store count growth and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  domestic franchise revenues were higher due to an increase in domestic same store sales and fees paid by franchisees related to the in sourcing of certain services  such as online ordering and a call center 
we also incurred an increase in general and administrative expenses for these services paid by franchisees 
these increases were offset in part by lower company owned store revenues resulting from the sale of company owned stores to multiple franchisees during the increase in revenues in was driven by higher domestic supply chain revenues resulting from increased volumes and higher commodity prices  including cheese  higher same store sales domestically and abroad and international store count growth 
these increases in were offset  in part by the inclusion of the rd week in  which benefited revenues by million in worldwide store counts have increased from  at the beginning of to  at the end of this growth in store counts can be attributed to the global growth of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system  which attract new franchisees and encourage existing franchisees to grow their business 
domestic same store sales increased in  in and in the increase in domestic same store sales during demonstrates that our products and promotions continue to resonate with consumers  including the launch of two improved chicken products  boneless chicken and wings  and the domino s artisan pizzas 
the significant increase in domestic same store sales in was attributable to our innovative and effective advertising campaign for our improved pizza recipe  continued focus on operational excellence and efforts to strengthen our franchisee base over the past several years 
the company experienced traffic increases in both our domestic company owned and franchise stores in and domestic same store sales in fiscal reflected the success of several initiatives  including the launch of two new product platforms domino s breadbowl pasta and domino s american legends pizzas  as well as the introduction of domino s chocolate lava crunch cakes and the introduction of our improved pizza recipe during the fourth quarter of international same store sales increased in  in and in internationally  same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of pizza and delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the domino s pizza concept 
income from operations increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in was driven primarily by higher royalty revenues from both domestic and international franchise stores and to a lesser extent  the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
additionally  income from operations in benefited from higher domestic company owned store margins 
the increase in income from operations in was due primarily to higher royalty revenues from domestic and international franchise stores and larger volumes in our supply chain business 
additionally  income from operations in benefited from higher domestic company owned store margins and approximately million of expenses incurred in in connection with the company s equity incentive plan changes that did not recur in these increases were offset  in part  by higher variable general and administrative expenses  including higher performance based bonuses as a result of our strong operating performance  as well as continued investments in growth initiatives 
additionally  the comparable results for were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the rd week in  which benefited income from operations by approximately million in 
table of contents net income increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations and lower interest expense 
the increase was offset in part by gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt in the increase in net income in was due primarily to the aforementioned increase in income from operations  lower interest expense resulting from lower debt balances  and the positive impact of a lower effective tax rate  offset in part by lower pre tax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt and the negative impact of the rd week in the inclusion of the rd week benefited net income in by approximately million 
we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in as of january   consolidated debt was billion 
historically  a large portion of our cash flows from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases 
our securitized debt requires interest only payments until april this interest only period can be extended for two one year periods if the company meets certain requirements in april and april based on fiscal financial results  the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that will be evaluated in each of april and april management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interest only periods at the extension assessment dates and would plan to exercise those extensions if a refinancing was not completed prior to the extension dates 
during the third quarter of  the company announced its intention to refinance its existing securitized debt 
in connection with the proposed early refinancing  the company incurred approximately million of fees during  of which approximately million were recorded as a deferred financing cost asset in the consolidated balance sheets 
due to volatility in the financial markets  the company later announced its intention to postpone the refinancing 
upon the completion of the expected refinancing  the deferred financing fees incurred plus any incremental fees will be amortized over the expected term of the new securitized debt 
overall  we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant excess cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible receivables  long lived and intangible assets  insurance and legal matters  share based payments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition 
we earn revenues through our network of domestic company owned and franchise stores  dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations 
retail sales from company owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers 
retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales  as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally of domestic franchise retail sales 
in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee  the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee s sales  however  these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts 
revenues from company owned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from time to time as a result of store count changes 
for example  if a company owned store that generated  in revenue in fiscal is sold to a franchisee in fiscal  revenues from company owned stores would have declined by  in fiscal  while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only  in fiscal  as we generally collect of a domestic franchisee s retail sales 
sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees  while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category 
additionally  we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while write offs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that future write offs will not exceed historical rates 
specifically  if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at january   our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately million  compared to million at january   representing approximately and of our consolidated gross accounts receivable at those respective year ends 
a change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at january  would result in a change in reserves of approximately million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount 
currently  management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 
long lived and intangible assets 
we record long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and capitalized software  at cost 
for acquisitions of franchise operations  we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets  historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition 
we depreciate and amortize long lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us 
we evaluate the potential impairment of long lived assets at least annually based on various analyses  including the projection of undiscounted cash flows and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
for company owned stores  we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis  which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to project the future market cash flows of company owned stores during the years presented 
same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets 
if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs  the carrying value of our company owned stores  by market  may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 
at january   we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment  specifically  the company owned stores reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit  which is primarily determined using the present value of historical cash flows  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill would be impaired 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented 
at january   the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value  including the related goodwill 
if cash flows generated by our company owned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
however  based on the latest impairment analysis  we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 
insurance and legal matters 
we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict 
accordingly  if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason  we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 
we had accruals for legal matters of approximately million at january  and approximately million at january  
table of contents for certain periods prior to december and for periods after december  we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation  general liability and owned and non owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between  and million  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates  which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events 
specifically  various methods  including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods  are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating these liabilities  several factors are considered  including the severity  duration and frequency of claims  legal cost associated with claims  healthcare trends and projected inflation 
over the past several years  we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims  however increasing severity of claims and medical costs has partially offset these trends 
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented 
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 
a change in our self insurance liability at january  would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately million for fiscal we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately million at january  and million at january  share based payments 
we recognize compensation expense related to our share based compensation arrangements over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the grant date fair value of each restricted stock and performance based restricted stock award is equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
the pricing model requires assumptions  including the expected life of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected volatility of our stock over the expected life  which significantly impact the assumed fair value 
we are also required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we use historical data to determine these assumptions 
additionally  our stock option  restricted stock and performance based restricted stock arrangements provide for accelerated vesting and the ability to exercise during the remainder of the ten year stock option life upon the retirement of individuals holding the awards who have achieved specified service and age requirements 
management believes that the methods and various assumptions used to determine compensation expense related to these arrangements are reasonable  but if the assumptions change significantly for future grants  share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets  if necessary 
as of january   we had no valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions  based on our estimates and assumptions 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet  including tax reserves  also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time  for example the completion of a tax audit  or the expiration of a statute of limitations  or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods

we generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale  and we generally experience to inventory turns per year 
in addition  our sales are not typically seasonal  which further limits our working capital requirements 
these factors  coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations  invest in our business and repurchase our fixed rate notes and our common stock  reduce our working capital amounts

during fiscal  the company borrowed an additional million under its variable funding note facility and is now fully drawn on the million facility 
our securitized debt requires interest only payments until april this interest only period can be extended for two one year periods if the company meets certain requirements in each of april and april based on our financial results for fiscal  the company currently exceeds the required threshold for extension that would be evaluated in each of april and april management currently expects to have the option to take advantage of these interest only periods at the extension assessment dates and would plan to exercise those extensions if a refinancing was not completed prior to the extension dates

during  the company experienced an increase in both domestic and international same store sales versus the same store sales were strong given that we were rolling over significant same store sales growth in these results demonstrate the sustained improvement in our domestic business and the consistent and reliable growth of our international business segment 
additionally  our international business continued to grow store count at a record pace in all of these factors have contributed to the company s continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows 
we expect to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and ongoing cash flows from operations to fund working capital requirements  invest in our core business  reduce our long term debt and repurchase our common stock 
we have historically funded our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt repayments and repurchases of common stock primarily from our cash flows from operations and  on occasion  our available borrowings under the variable funding notes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with the recapitalization in  we issued fixed rate notes and  at january   we are only exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes 
as of january   we had million outstanding under our variable funding note facility 
our fixed rate debt exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices 
during the normal course of business  we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and  as a result  we are subject to volatility in our food costs 
we may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk 
we do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
in instances when we use forward pricing agreements with our suppliers  these agreements cover our physical commodity needs  are not net settled and are accounted for as normal purchases 
interest rate derivatives from time to time we have entered into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of managing volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
we had no outstanding derivative instruments as of january  foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
total revenues of approximately in  in and in were derived from sales to customers and royalties from franchisees outside the contiguous united states 
this business is conducted in the local currency but royalty payments are generally remitted to us in us dollars 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
