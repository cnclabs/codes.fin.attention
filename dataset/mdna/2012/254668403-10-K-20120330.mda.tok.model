furthermore  to the extent that kingsbridge sells to third parties the shares of our common stock that we sell to kingsbridge under the ceff  our stock price may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market 
the perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to or by kingsbridge may cause holders of our common stock to sell their shares  or it may encourage short sales of our common stock or other similar transactions 
this could contribute to a decline in the stock price of our common stock 

table of contents we also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec on form s file no 
on june  which was declared effective shortly thereafter for the proposed offering from time to time of up to million of our securities  including common stock  preferred stock  varying forms of debt and warrant securities  or any combination of the foregoing 
we have issued securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement on several occasions  and may do so again in the future in response to market conditions or other circumstances on terms and conditions that will be determined at such time 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
in addition  as of december   approximately i million shares of our common stock were reserved for potential issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  ii million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans  and iii  shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our k plan 
the exercise of stock options and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution 
moreover  holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them  if ever  at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants 
such exercises  or the possibility of such exercises  may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly 
it may also reduce the price of our common stock 
if  during the term of certain of our warrants  we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets to holders of shares of our common stock  by way of return of capital or otherwise including any distribution of cash  stock or other securities  property or options by way of a dividend  spin off  reclassification  corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction  then the exercise price of such warrants may adjust downward and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants would increase 
in addition  in february  we issued five year warrants that contain an anti dilution provision that  subject to certain exclusions  potentially adjusts the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price 
for the purpose of valuing securities that we may issue in the future in unit offerings  this anti dilution provision values the warrant portion of a unit offering based on a black scholes pricing model 
when such black scholes value is subtracted from the actual per unit price of the offering  per share value of the shares issued in such unit offering is decreased for the purposes of the anti dilution provision 
if we issue shares  units  or warrants in a financing that triggers the anti dilution provision of our february five year warrants  the exercise price of the february five year warrants will be lowered thereby  increasing the likelihood that such warrants would be exercised 
as a result of such warrant adjustments  we may be required to issue more shares of common stock  or shares at lower prices  than previously anticipated  which could result in further dilution of our existing stockholders 
the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock  like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  has been and is likely to be volatile 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  patient adverse reactions to drug products  governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  changes in the united states or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  changes in the united states or foreign political environment and the passage of laws  including tax  environmental or other laws  affecting the product development business  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates

our common stock is listed for quotation on the nasdaq capital market 
during the month period ended december   the price of our common stock ranged between and 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly 
for the twelve month period ended december   the average daily trading volume in our common stock  was approximately  shares  and the average number of transactions per day  was approximately the instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
even if securities class actions that may be filed against us in the future were ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful  they would involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which could negatively affect our business 
if we fail to adhere to the strict listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market  we may be subject to delisting 
as a result  our stock price may decline and  following a hearing  our common stock may be delisted 
if our stock were no longer listed on the nasdaq capital market  the liquidity of our securities likely would be impaired 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol dsco 
if we fail to adhere to the market s strict listing criteria  our stock may be delisted 
this could potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price  which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity  but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage 
as a result  an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock 
we believe that current and prospective investors would view an investment in our common stock more favorably if it continues to be listed on the nasdaq capital market 
in december  we received a letter from the nasdaq global market global market indicating that we had failed to comply with nasdaq listing rule a minimum bid price rule  which requires that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share 
anticipating that we would not regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule on or before june   in may  we applied to transfer our common stock to the nasdaq capital market  which was effective on june  based on our ability to comply with all listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market other than the minimum bid price rule  nasdaq also granted us an additional days  or until november   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
on november   we received written notification from nasdaq that our common stock was subject to delisting because we had not regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule within the day period previously granted 
we requested a hearing with a nasdaq hearing panel  which stayed the delisting of our stock pending the panel s review 
on december   we implemented a for reverse stock split  after which the closing market price of our stock was above 
on january   following our hearing  the nasdaq hearing panel determined that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule because our common stock had maintained a minimum closing bid price of per share over a period of consecutive business days 
currently  our common stock continues to comply with all nasdaq listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market 
although we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain continued compliance with the minimum bid price rule or the other listing requirements of nasdaq 
there can be no assurance that the closing bid price of our common stock will continue to trade above 
moreover  if trading activity in our common stock were to reduce the total market capitalization of our company  we may find it difficult to fund our activities  which would result in reductions in our stockholders equity 
in addition to the minimum bid price rule  certain other nasdaq continued listing requirements require that we maintain a market capitalization of at least million or stockholders equity of at least million 
if we were unable to meet these requirements  we would receive another delisting notice from the nasdaq capital market for failure to comply with one or more of the continued listing requirements 

table of contents we expect to face uncertainty over reimbursement and healthcare reform 
in both the united states and other countries  sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  which include governmental health administration authorities  managed care providers and private health insurers 
government and other healthcare payers increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
moreover  the current political environment in the united states and abroad may result in the passage of significant legislation that could  among other things  restructure the markets in which we operate and restrict pricing strategies of drug development companies 
if  for example  price restrictions were placed on the distribution of our drugs  we may be forced to curtail development of our pipeline products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we succeed in commercializing our drug products  uncertainties regarding health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in quantities or at prices that will enable us to achieve profitability 
to obtain reimbursement from a third party payer  it must determine that our drug product is a covered benefit under its health plan  which is likely to require a determination that our product is safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 
obtaining a determination that a product is a covered benefit may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data about our products to each payer 
we may not be able to provide sufficient data to gain coverage 
even when a payer determines that a product is covered  the payer may impose limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
cost containment measures  if implemented to affect the coverage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products profitably 
moreover  coverage does not imply that any product will be covered in all cases or that reimbursement will be available at a rate that would permit a health care provider to cover its costs of using our product 
prices in many countries  including many in europe  are subject to local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products may be subject to price controls in several of the world s principal markets  including many countries within the european union 
in the united states  where pricing levels for our products are substantially established by third party payers  if payers reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product  it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product  to administer lower doses  to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price related concessions 
these actions could have a negative effect on our financial results  particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace 
the existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance 
the implementation of the health care reform law in the united states may adversely affect our business 
the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  each enacted in march  generally known as the health care reform law  significantly expands health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers 
we expect expansion of access to health insurance may increase the demand for our products  but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely 
we also expect that further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely 
the changes contemplated by the health care reform law are subject to rule making and implementation timelines that extend for several years  and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future 
however  any changes that lower reimbursements for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents the health care reform law establishes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers 
data collection obligations were to commence in january  and reporting requirements are to be implemented in on december   the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued proposed regulations to implement these provisions and sought substantial comments  thereby apparently delaying the january  start of information collection 
these proposed regulations are broadly drafted and still subject to change  and it is possible that when these regulations are finalized  our contract manufacturers or we will be subject to these reporting requirements 
in addition  several states require pharmaceutical and or device companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of products as well as gifts and payments to individual practitioners in the states  or prohibit certain marketing related activities 
other states  such as california  nevada  massachusetts and connecticut  require pharmaceutical and or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes 
wholesale distributors are covered by the laws in certain of these states 
in others  it is possible that we will be subject us to the state s reporting requirements and prohibitions 
compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations 
the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid  including imposing a excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in  and a fee on branded prescription drugs that was implemented in  both of which may affect sales of our products 
as us net sales are expected to be a significant portion of our worldwide net sales in the coming years  this additional tax burden may have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 
the health care reform law also mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates  discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under medicare part d  and in with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges  which could affect pricing and competition 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments and managed care arrangements  are continuing in many countries where we plan to do business  including the united states 
the health care reform law establishes the independent payment advisory board  which will be responsible  beginning in  annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality 
these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets 
further  the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs 
the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms  including the elimination of pre existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage  fixed percentages on medical loss ratios  expansion in medicaid and other programs  employer mandates  individual mandates  creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges  and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage 
the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations  a new healthcare delivery model 
while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown  it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change 
our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results  which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources  and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline 
we are required by the sec to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we are likewise required  on a quarterly basis  to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls 

table of contents in our internal control report for our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   management was unable to conclude that we had maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september   and identified a material weakness regarding our process and procedures related to the initial classification and subsequent accounting of registered warrants as liabilities or equity instruments 
upon a reassessment of those financial instruments  in light of gaap as currently interpreted  we determined that we should have accounted for registered warrants that we issued in may and february as derivative liabilities instead of equity 
as a result  to reclassify the affected warrants as derivative liabilities  in november  we restated our consolidated financial statements for the periods ended june  through june  the process to restate our financial statements was highly time consuming  resource intensive and involved substantial attention from management and significant legal and accounting expense 
to remediate the identified material weakness in our internal controls  we have enhanced our process to identify and correctly apply developments in accounting and to improve our understanding of the nuances of increasingly complex accounting standards 
we have improved access to the accounting literature  research materials and documents and increased communication among our legal and finance personnel and third party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications 
any failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis 
if our financial statements are not accurate  investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations 
likewise  if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the sec and nasdaq  we could face severe consequences from those authorities 
in either case  there could result a material adverse effect on our business 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls 
in addition  although we believe that we have remediated the material weakness that we identified in november  in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
responding to inquiries from the sec or nasdaq in the future will  regardless of the outcome  likely consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense 
further  many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits 
we depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel to support i the commercialization of surfaxin and afectair  and ii the advancement of our surfaxin ls and aerosurf development programs 
in particular  over the next months  we expect to hire approximately new employees primarily in the areas of field based sales and marketing  medical affairs  regulatory affairs  and quality control and assurance 
we expect that the hiring of such additional personnel will increase our annual expenditures by approximately million 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals is significant  and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success  and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us 
we are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors  as well as our scientific advisory board members  consultants and collaborating scientists 
many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years  have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us 
a loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs 
as of december   we had employment agreements with four executive officers  including chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer and treasurer  senior vice president and chief operating officer  and senior vice president  human resources 
these agreements provide for automatic one year renewal at the end of each term  unless otherwise terminated by either party  and will expire in may in february  we provided notice of non renewal for these agreements 
in addition  in may  we entered into retention agreements with five other executive officers under which each officer is provided certain severance benefits  based on title 
these agreements also expire in may prior to the may expiration date for the executive officer agreements  the compensation committee of our board of directors expects to review market and other compensation data  as well as other information that the committee may request  with a view to entering into new agreements with our executive officers 
the loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance 

table of contents as we prepare for the commercialization of our approved products  we will need to attract candidates to join our management  commercial  medical affairs and development teams  although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in that endeavor 
we may be unable to attract and retain necessary executive talent 
our industry generally seeks to attract and retain executive talent with compensation packages that include a significant equity component 
moreover  the equity incentives  including options and restricted stock  that we have issued are  for the most part  significantly devalued or out of the money and less likely to be exercisable in the future 
we plan in the future to seek stockholder approval for additional authorizations to support the use of equity incentives 
however  there can be no assurance that our stockholders will approve such incentives and  even if our stockholders approve new equity incentives that we will be able to attract and retain key executive talent in the interim period 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
while we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization  many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do  making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel 
we may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers 
our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors  which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards 
we compete with numerous existing companies intensely in many ways 
we intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and  consequently  we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial  technological  personnel and managerial resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals or products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products before us 
if we commence commercial product sales  we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
as none of our products are approved  we currently have limited or no experience in these areas 
in addition  developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  competition from colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations 
these competitors frequently aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing 
these institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
we expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made 
as a result  we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities 

table of contents if we cannot protect our intellectual property  other companies could use our technology in competitive products 
even if we obtain patents to protect our products  those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us 
we seek patent protection for our drug product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend in part on our ability and that of parties from whom we license technology to successfully obtain patents  defend our patents and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights  including our trade secrets 
the patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
to date  the united states patent and trademark office uspto has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford 
as a result  there are risks that we may not secure rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable 
the parties licensing technologies to us and we have filed various united states and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development  and the uspto and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies 
these patent applications include international applications filed under the patent cooperation treaty 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the uspto or foreign patent office issuing patents 
in addition  if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad  they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies 
furthermore  even if the uspto or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors  others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents  or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents 
thus  any patents we own or license from or to third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors 
the patents that we hold also have a limited life 
we have licensed a series of patents for our kl surfactant technology from j j and its wholly owned subsidiary ortho pharmaceutical corporation ortho pharmaceutical  which are important  both individually and collectively  to our strategy of commercializing our kl surfactant products 
these patents  which include important kl composition of matter claims and relevant european patents  began to expire in november  and will expire on various dates ending in or  in some cases  possibly later 
of the patents that have expired  we have extended the term of our most important patent until november  with further extensions possible into for our aerosolized kl surfactant  we hold exclusive licenses in the united states and outside the united states to pmusa s cag technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases 
our exclusive license in the united states also extends to other non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
the cag technology patents expire on various dates beginning in may and ending in  or  in some cases  possibly later 
we have filed  and when possible and appropriate  will file  other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the united states and in foreign countries 
we may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and  if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable  additional patents may not be issued to us 
see also  if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary kl surfactant technology  our novel cag technology  and our novel ventilator circuit patient interface connectors 
our technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our kl surfactant technology  our cag technology and our novel patient interface and related componentry to treat life threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products 
our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our drug device combination products based on these technologies 
any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others 
in certain cases  the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential while the applications are pending 
as a result  we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications 
we may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings  which would be costly  unpredictable and time consuming 
even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us  they would likely divert substantial resources  including management time  from our other activities 
moreover  any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products 
an adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities 
if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
we depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development 
presently  we have licensed rights from j j  ortho pharmaceutical  pmusa and pmpsa 
these agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements 
all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product 
in addition  we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us 
if we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner  we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology 
finally  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies 
licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce 
although we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property  including the use of agreements relating to the non disclosure of our confidential information to third parties  as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them  such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce 
we generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants  advisors and research collaborators  however  to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects  disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights 
such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results 
in addition  we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors or others 
despite the protective measures we employ  we still face the risk that agreements may be breached  agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach  our trade secrets or proprietary know how may otherwise become known  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or our competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets 

table of contents moreover  although our four senior executive officers have agreements that include non competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee s refraining from competition with us  such noncompete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce  such that  if any should resign  we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them 
the failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation  including securities class action  product liability and patent claims  could harm our financial performance and business operations 
we are potentially susceptible to litigation 
for example  as a public company  we may be subject to claims asserting violations of securities laws 
even if such actions are found to be without merit  the potential impact of such actions  which generally seek unquantified damages and attorneys fees and expenses  is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business activities  including manufacturing and marketing our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks 
using our drug product candidates or medical devices in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims 
for our products that are approved for commercial sale  the risk of product liability claims is increased 
even if approved  our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death 
in addition  we may be subject to product liability claims involving our afectair and other medical devices and alleged design defects or other safety issues that result in an unsafe condition leading to injury or death 
product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise 
the design  manufacture and marketing of surfaxin and the afectair devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims 
there are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to a patient  including manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information 
product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits  is difficult to assess or quantify 
plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we presently carry general liability  excess liability  products liability and property insurance coverage in amounts that are customary for companies in our industry of comparable size and level of activity 
however  our insurance policies contain various deductibles  limitations and exclusions from coverage  and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us  could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 
we may need to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage  including with locally authorized insurers licensed in countries where we market our approved products or conduct our clinical trials  before initiating clinical trials  however  such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance  with acceptable limits and retentions  at an acceptable cost 
any product  general liability or product liability claim  even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and or unsuccessful  could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes  such as research and development 
in addition  such claims could result in uninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants  a decrease in demand for our drug product candidates  damage to our reputation  and an inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates  if approved 
moreover  the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  as the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending  we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued  the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our kl surfactant product candidates may give rise to a declaration of interference by the uspto  or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices  or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies  institutions or individuals 
these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents  obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities 
our corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products  if approved  and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business 
many of our activities  including the research  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of our products  are subject to extensive laws and regulation  including without limitation  health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices  but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
if any such investigations  actions or lawsuits are instituted against us  and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability  such investigations  actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law could defer a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  before the redemption of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  could issue large blocks of preferred stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights agreement  which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors thereby discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the shareholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors

overview discovery laboratories  inc referred to as we  us  or the company is a specialty biotechnology company focused on creating life saving products for critical care patients with respiratory disease and improving the standard of care in pulmonary medicine 
our proprietary drug technology produces a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant kl surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant  a substance produced naturally in the lung and essential for normal respiratory function and survival 
we are developing our kl surfactant in liquid  lyophilized and aerosolized dosage forms 
we are also developing novel drug delivery technologies potentially to enable efficient delivery of inhaled therapies  including our aerosolized kl surfactant 
we believe that our proprietary technologies make it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of products to address a variety of respiratory diseases for which there frequently are few or no approved therapies 
on march   the us food and drug administration fda granted us marketing approval for surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants at high risk for rds 
surfaxin is the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant approved for use in neonatal medicine and provides healthcare practitioners with an alternative to the animal derived surfactants that today are the standard of care to manage rds in premature infants 
we are implementing a plan that  if successful  is intended to result in the commercial introduction of surfaxin in the united states in fourth quarter of our strategy is initially to focus the development of our kl surfactant and aerosol technologies to improve the management of rds in premature infants 
rds is a serious respiratory condition caused by insufficient surfactant production in underdeveloped lungs of premature infants  and the most prevalent respiratory disease in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu 
rds can result in long term respiratory problems  developmental delay and death 
mortality and morbidity rates associated with rds have not meaningfully improved over the last decade 
we believe that the rds market is presently underserved  and that our rds programs  beginning with surfaxin and  if approved  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and  collectively over time  to become the global standard of care for premature infants with rds 
surfaxin ls is our lyophilized freeze dried dosage form of surfaxin that is stored as a powder and resuspended to liquid form prior to use 
we are developing surfaxin ls with the objective of improving ease of use for healthcare practitioners  as well as potentially to prolong shelf life and eliminate the need for cold chain storage 
we are implementing a regulatory plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls in the united states  the european union and other major markets worldwide 
aerosurf is a drug device combination product that combines our kl surfactant with our proprietary capillary aerosol generator cag and our novel afectair ventilator circuit patient interface connectors 
we are developing aerosurf for premature infants with or at risk of rds 
premature infants with rds currently are treated with surfactants that can only be administered by endotracheal intubation supported with mechanical ventilation  both invasive procedures that frequently result in serious respiratory conditions and complications 
as a consequence  neonatologists will not treat infants who could benefit from surfactant therapy unless the potential benefits of surfactant therapy outweigh the risks associated with such invasive administration procedures 
aerosurf potentially will provide practitioners with the ability to deliver surfactant therapy using a less invasive method 
for this reason  we believe that aerosurf  if approved  potentially may enable the treatment of a significantly greater number of premature infants at risk for rds who could benefit from surfactant therapy but are currently not treated 

table of contents afectair  a series of disposable ventilator circuit patient interface connectors  was initially developed for use in nicus as part of our aerosurf development program 
afectair devices simplify the delivery of inhaled therapies including our aerosolized kl surfactant to critical care patients requiring ventilatory support by introducing the inhaled therapy directly at the patient interface and minimizing the number of connections in the ventilator circuit 
we initially developed a ventilator circuit patient interface connector to be used with our cag in the nicu 
to benefit all critical care patients who require inhaled therapies and who are receiving ventilatory support  we are developing afectair devices in different sizes for use in nicus  pediatric intensive care units picus and adult intensive care units icus  and to be compatible with a variety of aerosol generating devices 
in february  we successfully registered our initial afectair device  which is intended for use with jet nebulizers and other aerosol generators  in the united states as a class i  exempt medical device 
we believe that afectair has the potential to become a new standard of care for the delivery of inhaled therapies to critical care patients 
we are implementing a regulatory and manufacturing plan that  if successful  is intended to result in the commercial introduction of the initial afectair device in the united states and the european union in the fourth quarter of  and a second afectair device  afectair duo  in mid we are preparing for the commercial introductions  beginning in late  of surfaxin in the united states  and afectair in the united states and the european union and other markets worldwide thereafter 
to accomplish our objectives  in the united states  we plan to build our own  in house  specialty respiratory critical care commercial and medical affairs organization that will specialize in neonatal indications  beginning with surfaxin 
we expect that our commercial and medical affairs organization will be able to leverage the experience and relationships that we gain with the introduction of surfaxin to efficiently support the introductions of surfaxin ls and aerosurf  if approved 
we also expect that our in house organization will also work in a coordinated manner with a network of third party distributors to execute the commercial introduction of the afectair devices 
in major markets outside the united states  an important priority is to secure the strategic resources to support the continued development and commercial introduction of our rds products 
a key goal for us in is to secure one or more strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements potentially to share research and development expenses for our surfaxin ls and aerosurf development programs  and  if approved  to support the commercial introduction of these products in europe and elsewhere 
we may also seek strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of surfaxin in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the recent approval of surfaxin by the fda 
we are engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners who could provide development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in concluding any strategic alliance  collaboration or other similar transaction 
the reader is referred to  and encouraged to read in its entirety item business of this annual report on form k  which contains a discussion of our business and business strategy  as well as information concerning our proprietary technologies and our current and planned kl pipeline programs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in part iv to this annual report on form k 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with our personnel  facilities  manufacturing operations  pharmaceutical and device development  research  clinical  regulatory  other preclinical and clinical activities and medical affairs 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
warrant accounting we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in accounting standards codification topic derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity asc topic  as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
we classify derivative warrant liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
we use the black scholes or trinomial pricing models  depending on the applicable terms of the warrant agreement  to value the derivative warrant liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
see  results of operations change in fair value of common stock warrant liability 
results of operations net loss and operating loss the net loss for the years ended december   and was million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
included in the net loss is the change in fair value of certain common stock warrants classified as derivative liabilities  resulting in non cash income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the operating loss for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the operating loss includes million and million for non cash items related to depreciation and stock based compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding non cash items related to depreciation and stock based compensation  the operating loss was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and grant revenue for the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million  for funds received and expended under a fast track small business innovation research grant sbir from the national institutes of health to support the development of aerosolized kl surfactant for rds 
we did not recognize any grant revenues in research and development expenses our research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred and we track such costs by category rather than by project 
as many of our research and development activities form a foundation for the development of our kl surfactant and drug delivery technologies  they benefit more than a single project 
for that reason  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs or our research and development activities on a project by project basis 
we believe that tracking our expenses by category is a more accurate method of accounting for these activities 
our research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with a manufacturing and product development  b medical and regulatory operations  and c direct preclinical and clinical programs 
we also track research and development by major expense category as follows i salaries and benefits  ii contracted services  iii rents and utilities  iv depreciation  v raw materials and supplies  vi contract manufacturing  vii stock based compensation and viii other 

table of contents research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were million  and million  respectively 
these costs are charged to operations as incurred and are tracked by category  as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses manufacturing and product development medical and regulatory operations direct preclinical and clinical programs total research and development expenses certain expenses have been reclassified to conform to presentation 
research and development expenses include non cash charges associated with stock based compensation and depreciation of million and million for the years months ended december  and  respectively 
for a description of the clinical programs included in research and development  see  item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine in this annual report on form k 
manufacturing and product development manufacturing and product development includes i the cost of our manufacturing operations  quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities to assure adequate production of clinical and commercial drug supply for our kl surfactant products  in conformance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp  ii design and development activities related to the development and manufacture of our cag for use in our preclinical programs  our anticipated clinical programs  and  if approved  commercial use  iii design and development activities related to our novel ventilator circuit patient interface connectors  including our afectair and afectair duo devices  and  iv pharmaceutical development activities  including development of a lyophilized dosage form of our kl surfactant 
these costs include employee expenses  facility related costs  depreciation  costs of drug substances including raw materials  supplies  quality control and assurance activities  analytical services  and expert consultants and outside services to support pharmaceutical and device development activities 
the million increase in manufacturing and product development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to costs associated with the manufacture of surfaxin batches needed to execute the comprehensive preclinical program that we conducted to respond to the complete response letter  partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with the technology transfer of our surfaxin ls lyophilized manufacturing process to a third party contract manufacturer 
manufacturing and product development expenses include non cash charges associated with stock based compensation and depreciation of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and medical and regulatory operations medical and regulatory operations includes i medical  scientific  clinical  regulatory  data management and biostatistics activities in support of our research and development programs  and ii medical affairs activities to provide scientific and medical education support in connection with our kl surfactant and aerosol delivery technologies programs  these costs include personnel  expert consultants  outside services to support regulatory and data management  symposiums at key neonatal medical meetings  facilities related costs  and other costs for the management of clinical trials 
medical and regulatory operations expenses in are comparable to  primarily due to our efforts to conserve financial and other resources while we focused our efforts on securing marketing authorization for surfaxin 
medical and regulatory operations expenses include non cash charges associated with stock based compensation and depreciation of million and million for the years months ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents direct preclinical and clinical programs direct preclinical and clinical programs include i activities related to responding to the complete response letter  ii preclinical activities  including preparatory activities for the anticipated clinical trials for surfaxin ls and aerosurf for rds in premature infants  toxicology studies and other preclinical studies to obtain data to support potential investigational new drug ind and nda filings for our product candidates  and iii activities associated with conducting human clinical trials including patient enrollment costs  external site costs  clinical drug supply and related external costs  such as contract research consultant fees and expenses  including  in  activities related to the completion of the phase clinical trial evaluating the use of surfaxin in children up to two years of age suffering with acute respiratory failure arf 
the million decrease in direct preclinical and clinical program expenses in as compared to is primarily due to expenses associated with the completion of the phase arf clinical trial incurred in in an effort to focus our financial resources  we plan to focus our drug research and development activities on the management of rds in premature infants and specifically in our surfaxin ls and aerosurf development programs to advance them towards initiation of our planned phase and phase clinical trials  respectively 
we also plan to meet with us and european regulatory authorities to discuss the requirements for our regulatory packages  including potential trial design requirements  to prepare for our planned clinical trials 
if successful  we plan to initiate the planned aerosurf phase and surfaxin ls phase clinical programs in late  after we have secured one or more strategic alliances and or necessary capital  our surfaxin ls phase clinical program in late as resources permit  we may make limited investments in non rds programs  including potentially acute lung injury ali  chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder copd and cystic fibrosis cf 
research and development by major expense category we also track our research and development by major expense category as shown in the following table salaries benefits contracted services raw materials supplies rents utilities depreciation contract manufacturing stock based compensation all other total the increase in salaries and benefits in as compared to is primarily due to increased benefit costs  employee incentive payments and employee severance costs 
contracted services include the cost of preclinical studies  clinical trial activities  certain components of our manufacturing operations  quality control and analytical testing of our drug product  biological activity testing  consulting services  aerosol device design and engineering services  etc 
the decrease in as compared to is primarily due to costs in related to the completion of the phase arf clinical trial and a decrease in outside laboratory testing related to activities to address the complete response letter 
raw materials and supplies consist of purchases of our active pharmaceutical ingredients for the manufacture of our kl surfactant product candidates and supplies to support our manufacturing and laboratory operations 
in addition  raw materials and supplies include component parts used in the development of our cag and raw materials and supplies used in manufacturing and product development activities for our novel ventilator circuit patient interface connectors 
the increase in raw materials and supplies in as compared to is primarily due to the manufacture of surfaxin batches needed to execute the comprehensive preclinical program that we conducted to respond to the complete response letter 

table of contents rents and utilities are associated with our leased manufacturing  laboratory and related facilities 
depreciation is primarily associated with leasehold improvements at our laboratories and headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania as well as manufacturing and laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements at our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
contract manufacturing represents costs related to the technology transfer of the surfaxin ls lyophilized manufacturing process to a cgmp compliant  third party contract management organization cmo with expertise in lyophilized formulations 
the decrease in contract manufacturing costs in as compared to is due to a reduction in technology transfer activities associated with surfaxin ls while we focused our efforts on responding to the complete response letter and securing marketing authorization for surfaxin 
research and development projects a substantial portion of our cumulative losses to date  including approximately million in the two year period ended december   relate to investments in our research and development projects 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in clinical development and the regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete individual projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
with every phase of a development project  there are significant unknowns that may significantly affect cost projections and timelines 
as a result of the number and nature of these factors  many of which are outside our control  the success  timing of completion and ultimate cost  of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting our ability to estimate projections and timelines  see  item business government regulation  and item a risk factors the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals for the commercialization of our products  our research and development activities involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business  manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs  or  if our products are approved  product launch  or cause us to experience shortages of products inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our lead kl surfactant drug product  surfaxin  was recently approved for marketing in the united states 
in addition  we recently registered our initial afectair device in the united states and expect to complete the registration of that device in the european union in although we have two approved products at this time  neither are available for commercial sale 
we currently plan to initiate the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in late  although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing these products or in realizing a profit in the foreseeable future 
our other kl surfactant drug development projects are initially focused on the management of rds in premature infants and include surfaxin ls and aerosurf 
we believe that these neonatal programs have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and expand the current rds market worldwide 
we plan in to seek regulatory and scientific guidance with respect to our planned development programs for surfaxin ls and aerosurf  however  our ability to move forward with our planned clinical trials for both surfaxin ls and aerosurf will depend upon the success of our efforts to complete our development activities and secure strategic alliances and or necessary capital to support these activities 
if we are successful within our target time frame  we believe that we could be in a position to initiate our clinical programs for surfaxin ls and aerosurf in late however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such an alliance or capital  that our development plans for these products will be successful  if at all  and within our anticipated time frames 
accordingly  we are unable to reliably project when we might implement these programs  the pace of such implementation or the overall anticipated expense that we might incur 

table of contents the status of our lead projects and our other pipeline candidates  including the potential timing and milestones for each  is discussed in item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
see also  item business business strategy  and item a risk factors we may not successfully develop and market our products  and even if we do  we may not become profitable  we will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue to operate as a going concern 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution 
our ability to generate sufficient capital to support our product development activities and  if approved  commercialization of surfaxin ls and aerosurf in the european union and other markets outside the us  depends upon many factors  including the success of our efforts i to commercialize surfaxin and afectair  ii to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support the further development and  if approved  commercialization of surfaxin ls and aerosurf in markets outside the united states  and or iii to enter into alternative financial arrangements that would provide the required capital 
we believe that our ability to successfully enter into meaningful strategic alliances has likely improved with receipt of marketing approval in the united states for surfaxin and our improved financial condition as a result of our march public offering see  liquidity and capital resources financings pursuant to common stock offerings universal shelf  and will further improve if we are able to advance our surfaxin ls and aerosurf programs towards initiation of planned phase and phase clinical trials  respectively 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully commercialize surfaxin ls or afectair  that we will be able to secure strategic partners or collaborators to support and provide expert advice to guide our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital to support our activities when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
see  liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our kl surfactant technology has the potential to be developed into a broad product pipeline that could address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions in patient populations ranging from premature infants to adults 
at the present time  we plan to focus our resources on rds programs and pace investments in potential non rds pipeline programs 
see  item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
however  we plan to consider opportunistically sponsoring and supporting third party investigator initiated preclinical and clinical programs directed at establishing proof of concept through phase studies for each potential indication 
if successful  we plan to assess the potential markets for these products and determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements  or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development 
see  item business business strategy  and surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
ultimately  if we do not successfully develop and gain marketing approval for our drug product candidates  in the united states or elsewhere  we will not be able to commercialize  or generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of executive management  business and commercial development  finance and accounting  intellectual property and legal  human resources  information technology  facility and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
included in general and administrative expenses were non cash charges associated with stock based compensation and depreciation of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and in addition  general and administrative expenses include one time charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with certain contractual cash severance obligations related to our former executive vice president and general counsel in and for our former president and chief executive officer in excluding the charges related to our severance obligation and charges associated with stock based compensation and depreciation  general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the increase is primarily related to employee incentive payments and afectair market research activities 

table of contents we believe our existing general and administrative resources  including legal  finance  business development  information technologies  human resources and general management capabilities  are sufficient to support our business operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to may make additional investments in the future to enhance these capabilities as and when required to meet the needs of our business 
with respect to our planned commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in late  we expect to incur expenses at an annual rate of approximately million  which primarily represents investment in marketing  field based sales and medical affairs capabilities 
we anticipate that our medical affairs personnel will provide medical education support for both surfaxin and afectair  as both products may be of interest to many of the same medical practitioners and involve many of the same medical congresses  many of the same medical journals and publications  and many of the same hospitals 
we expect that this anticipated synergy will result in certain economies for each of these products 
we expect to invest in maintaining our existing patent portfolio  trademarks  trade secrets and regulatory exclusivity designations  including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities  and when appropriate  patent extensions  new patents  new trademarks  and new regulatory exclusivity designations  when available 
see  item business licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations 
change in fair value of common stock warrant liability we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in asc topic  either as derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
derivative warrant liabilities are valued using the black scholes or trinomial pricing models  depending on the applicable terms of the warrant agreement at the date of initial issuance and each subsequent balance sheet date 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
the registered warrants that we issued in our may and february public offerings generally provide that  in the event a related registration statement or an exemption from registration is not available for the issuance or resale of the warrant shares upon exercise of the warrant  the holder may exercise the warrant on a cashless basis 
notwithstanding the availability of cashless exercise  under generally accepted accounting principles  these registered warrants are deemed to be subject to potential net cash settlement and must be classified as derivative liabilities because i under the federal securities laws  it may not be within our absolute control to provide freely tradable shares upon exercise of the warrants in all circumstances  and ii the warrant agreements do not expressly state that there is no circumstance in which we may be required to effect a net cash settlement of the warrants 
the applicable accounting principles expressly do not allow for an evaluation of the likelihood that an event would result in a cash settlement 
accordingly  the may and february warrants have been classified as derivative liabilities and reported  at each balance sheet date  at estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the registered five year warrants that we issued in the february public offering february five year warrants expressly provide that under no circumstances will we be required to effect a net cash settlement of these warrants 
however  these warrants contain anti dilutive provisions that adjust the exercise price if we issue any common stock  securities convertible into common stock  or other securities subject to certain exceptions at a value below the then existing exercise price of the february five year warrants

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred substantial losses since inception  due to investments in research and development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
historically  we have funded our business operations through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  draw downs under a series of committed equity financing facilities ceffs  capital equipment and debt facilities  and strategic alliances 
we expect to fund our business operations primarily through a combination  or all  of public offerings  including our ceff and atm program see  committed equity financing facility ceff  and atm program  anticipated revenue from the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair  strategic alliances  the exercise of outstanding warrants  and debt facilities 
our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  primarily the success of our efforts i to execute the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in the united states and other markets  as planned  ii to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support the development and  if approved  commercial introduction of surfaxin ls and aerosurf in the european union and markets outside the us  iii to advance the surfaxin ls and aerosurf development programs to be in a position to initiate planned phase and phase clinical trials  respectively  and iv to procure the additional capital necessary and desirable to support our activities until such time as the net revenues from our approved products  from potential strategic alliance and other collaboration arrangements and from other sources  such as future warrant exercises  are sufficient to offset cash flow requirements 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
from january  through march   i holders of month warrants we issued in february have exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of million  and ii holders of the five year warrants we issued in february have exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of  in addition  on march   we delivered a sales notice under our atm program to sell shares of common stock 
we terminated the offering on march  as a result of that offering  we issued an aggregate  shares of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting commissions due to the sales agent 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock for net proceeds to us after underwriter fees and anticipated expenses of approximately million 
in addition  we granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  with respect to which we potentially could realize additional net proceeds of million 

table of contents as of december  and march   of the million shares of common stock authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  we had available for issuance  and not otherwise reserved for future issuance  approximately million and million shares of common stock  respectively 
to execute our business strategy over time  we anticipate potentially securing additional infusions of capital from a combination of some or all of the following sources exercise of outstanding warrants in connection with our february public offering  we issued month warrants to purchase five million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share month warrants of which  warrants have been exercised through march  if the market price of our common stock should exceed at any time prior to may the expiration date of these warrants  and if the holders determine in their discretion to exercise the month warrants and we have an effective registration statement covering the warrant shares  we potentially could raise up to an additional million 
also in connection with the february public offering  we issued five year warrants to purchase five million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share five year warrants 
these warrants also contain anti dilutive provisions that adjust the exercise price if we issue any common stock  securities convertible into common stock  or other securities subject to certain exceptions at a value below the then existing exercise price 
as a result of the march public offering  the exercise price of these warrants has been adjusted downward to per share 
thus  if the market price of our common stock should remain above at any time prior february the expiration date of these warrants  and if the holders determine in their discretion to exercise the five year warrants and we have an effective registration statement covering the warrant shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants  we potentially could raise up to an additional million 
upfront and milestone payments and co funding of development activities associated with potential strategic alliances or other similar transactions we are engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners who could provide development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses to support the development of surfaxin ls and aerosurf and  if approved  the introduction of these products in europe and various markets outside the us secured debt arrangements to fund working capital and or investment in capital assets in the future  if our efforts are successful  we believe that debt could potentially be a component of our capital structure and financing plans 
we could potentially enter into capital equipment financing facilities  revolving working capital lines of credit  term loans and other similar transactions to satisfy our working capital requirements 
in appropriate circumstances  to secure additional capital and strengthen our financial condition  we will also consider equity public offerings and other financing transactions we have a ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge that could allow us  at our discretion  to raise capital subject to certain conditions  including volume limitations at a time and in amounts we deem suitable to support our business plans 
based on the closing market price of our common stock on march  and assuming that all available shares are issued  the potential availability under our ceff is approximately million 

table of contents in december  we established an at the market program atm program  which allows us  at our discretion and at such times that we may choose  to sell up to a maximum of million of shares of common stock 
based on the closing market price of our common stock on march   and assuming that the full amount available under the atm program million is sold  we may issue up to approximately million additional shares under the atm program 
see  financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
we have agreed in connection with our march public offering that we will not issue or sell with certain limited exceptions securities for a period of days ending in june see  financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will remain at levels that make exercise of outstanding warrants likely or that holders of outstanding warrants will choose to exercise any or all of their warrants prior to the warrant expiration date  that we will be successful in concluding any strategic alliance  collaboration or other financing transaction  that the ceff will be available at any time  or  even if available  that we will utilize the ceff prior to its expiration in june  that we will issue any shares pursuant to the atm program  or that the entire amount provided under the atm program will be realized prior the expiration or earlier termination of the atm program  or that we will undertake any financings or similar transactions  on favorable terms or otherwise 
we believe  if we are successful in implementing our strategic business plan  that the anticipated net revenues from the sales of surfaxin and afectair  when combined with the other sources of anticipated capital outlined above  including from potential strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements to support the surfaxin ls and aerosurf development programs  potentially could be sufficient to support our future operations 
in that event  we would nevertheless continue to consider financings and similar transactions that would strengthen our financial condition and build value for our stockholders 
although we currently believe that we will be successful in meeting our strategic planning goals within the time frame set forth above  there can be no assurance that we will successfully fund and build our own commercial organization to support the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair  that we will successfully execute the launch of surfaxin and afectair within the anticipated time frame  that the revenues we may realize from the sale of surfaxin and afectair will be in line with current expectations  that we will successfully identify one or more strategic partners or collaboration arrangements to support development and  if approved  commercial introduction of the surfaxin ls and aerosurf product candidates  or that the revenues  if any  that we generate in the future will be sufficient at any time to fund the further development of our research and development programs and support our operations 
if we are unable to identify and enter into strategic alliances for the development of surfaxin ls and aerosurf  and if approved  commercialization of surfaxin ls and aerosurf in the european union and other markets outside the us  we may be unable to fund planned clinical trials  which would have a material adverse effect on our research and development programs
