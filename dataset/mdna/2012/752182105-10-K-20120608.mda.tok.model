overview business rand logistics  inc formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  as a blank check company to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing ltd  a canadian corporation which  with its subsidiary lower lakes transportation company  provides bulk freight shipping services throughout the great lakes region 
as part of the acquisition of lower lakes  we also acquired lower lakes affiliate  grand river navigation company  inc prior to the acquisition  we did not conduct  or have any investment in  any operating business 
subsequent to the acquisition  we have added several additional vessels to our fleet through acquisition transactions  including in alone  the acquisition of three articulated tug and barge units and two bulk carriers 
our shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the great lakes that were restricted in their ability to receive larger vessels 
lower lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of seventeen cargo carrying vessels one of which is no longer sailing 
we have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the great lakes and the leading service provider in the river class market segment 
we transport limestone  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction  electric utility  integrated steel and food industries 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act  in the us and the coasting trade act in canada 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  selected financial information usd in s fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change revenue freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges outside voyage charter revenue total expenses outside voyage charter fees vessel operating expenses repairs and maintenance sailing days per day in whole usd revenue per sailing day freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges expenses per sailing day vessel operating expenses repairs and maintenance the following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and vessel operating expenses as a result of changes in sailing days  which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing  during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  usd in s sailing days freight and related revenue fuel and other surcharges outside voyage charter total revenue vessel operating expenses fiscal year ended march  changes in fiscal year ended march  increase attributable to stronger canadian dollar net increase attributable to customer demand and pricing excluding currency impact changes in outside voyage charter revenue excluding currency impact sub total fiscal year ended march  total revenue during the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher freight revenue and fuel surcharges and the stronger canadian dollar  offset by substantially reduced outside charter revenue 
during the fiscal year ended march   us flagged vessels industry wide experienced a increase in overall customer demand compared to the fiscal year ended march  other than coal  for which us flagged shipments decreased by  overall industry tonnage increased for all of the major commodities during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  freight and other related revenue generated from company operated vessels increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  excluding the impact of currency changes  freight revenue increased during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was attributable to additional sailing days resulting in an increase in tonnage hauled by our operated vessels and contractual price increases 
management believes that each of our vessels should achieve approximately sailing days in an average great lakes season assuming no major repairs or incidents and normal drydocking cycle times performed during the winter lay up period 
we operated fourteen vessels during the fiscal year ended march   including the two vessels acquired in february and the vessel acquired in july  compared to twelve vessels during the fiscal year ended march  the company did not sail the two vessels acquired in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march  the company s vessels sailed an average of approximately sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  freight and related revenue per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was somewhat offset by inefficiencies experienced earlier in the year in matching fleet configuration with customer requirements  delays in completing required winter work which delays caused us to begin the sailing season later than our typical april start date and one of our vessels being out of service for days due to its repowering 
all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby increases and decreases in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers 
such increases and decreases in fuel surcharges impact margin percentages  but do not significantly impact our margin dollars 
fuel and other surcharges increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was attributable to higher fuel costs  a stronger canadian dollar and an increased number of sailing days 
fuel and other surcharges per sailing day increased  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  outside voyage charter revenues decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in outside voyage charter revenues was due to our purchase in july of a vessel that we had previously operated under long term time charter 
vessel operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel costs  an increased number of sailing days  two additional vessels acquired in february  one additional vessel acquired in july and a stronger canadian dollar  partially offset by a reduction of costs due to the long term lay up of one of our vessels during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance expenses  which primarily consist of expensed winter work  increased million to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance per sailing day increased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to the combined impact of the delays in completing winter work at the start of the sailing season and the normal winter work done during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses increased million to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was a result of higher compensation costs  million attributable to bank administrative fees due under the black creek loan  million of audit costs associated with the implementation of compliance with section b of the sarbanes oxley act and the stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses represented of freight revenues during the fiscal year ended march   a decrease from of freight revenues during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our operating companies 
depreciation expense increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to i the two vessels acquired in february and the vessel acquired in july  which collectively represented an increase of million  ii a stronger canadian dollar and iii increased depreciation from winter capital expenditures  including the repowering of one of our vessels that was completed in june amortization of drydock costs increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to the stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company amortized the deferred drydock costs of nine of its fourteen operated vessels  compared to eight vessels during the fiscal year ended march  amortization of intangibles increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to additional amortization related to the vessels acquired in february and  to a lesser extent  a stronger canadian dollar 
as a result of the items described above  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s operating income increased million to million compared to operating income of million during the fiscal year ended march  operating income plus depreciation  amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles increased  or million  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances due to the million increase in the canadian term loan in august partially offset by a lower revolver debt balance  the million black creek loan in february  the cdn million increase in the canadian term loan in july  the million increase in the us term loan on december  and higher amortization of deferred financing costs  partially offset by interest expense capitalized with the capital expenditures of the repowering of the michipicoten 
we recorded a gain on interest rate swap contracts of million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a gain of million recorded in the fiscal year ended march  due to the recording of the fair value of our two interest rate swaps at the end of each such periods 
our income before income taxes was million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to income before income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended march  our effective tax rate was a benefit of for the fiscal year ended march  compared to an expense of for the fiscal year ended march  our provision for income tax expense was a benefit of million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a provision for income tax expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  this change was due to a combination of higher net income before taxes in the fiscal year ended march   a change in mix of income between the united states and canada and the full reversal of the federal valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the tax benefit associated with the reversal of the valuation allowance related to the net us federal deferred tax assets against current income before taxes 
the federal valuation allowance was reversed based on our improved profitability 
our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was higher than the statutory tax rate due to imputed interest income and state and foreign income taxes  which were offset substantially by the reduction in the federal valuation allowance 
our net income before preferred stock dividends was million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  we accrued million for cash dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the dividends accrued at an average rate of during the fiscal year ended march  the dividend rate increased to a cap of effective july  our net income applicable to common stockholders was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a loss of million during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated an average of approximately six vessels in the us and eight vessels in canada 
the percentage of our total freight and other revenue  fuel and other surcharge revenue  vessel operating expenses  repairs and maintenance costs  and combined depreciation and amortization costs  approximate the percentage of vessel ownership by country 
our outside voyage charter revenue and costs relate solely to our canadian subsidiary and approximately of our general and administrative costs are incurred in canada 
approximately of our interest expense is incurred in canada  and approximately of our gain on interest rate swap contracts was realized in canada  consistent with our percentage of overall indebtedness by country 
all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us 
impact of inflation and changing prices during the fiscal year ended march   there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs 
however  our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges 
in addition  there was significant volatility in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during the past two fiscal years  which impacted our translation of revenue and costs to us dollars by an increase of approximately during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility and proceeds from sales of our common stock 
our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facility 
information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows categorized by operating  investing and financing activities which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march  the company makes seasonal net borrowings under its revolving credit facility during the first quarter of each fiscal year to fund working capital needed to commence the sailing season 
such borrowings are then paid down during the second half of each fiscal year 
we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowings under our credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if the company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the company s customers materially delay their receivable payments due to further deterioration of economic conditions  the company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity 
the company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls  and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net cash provided was primarily due to higher cash earnings  offset partially by substantially higher deferred drydock costs in the fiscal year ended march  the company did not incur any significant bad debt write offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during the fiscal year ended march  the timing of the end of the company s fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of a sailing season s receivables to be collected prior to the end of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  the earlier start of a sailing season prior to april  can increase the amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable in the company s balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was due primarily to the purchase of three vessels during the fiscal year ended march  at a lower combined acquisition cost than the vessels acquired in the fiscal year ended march   offset by higher capital spending primarily attributable to upgrades to the vessels we acquired in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided in financing activities decreased million to million provided during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million provided in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company received debt proceeds of million  received proceeds from newly issued shares of common stock of million  and made principal payments on its term debt of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company received debt proceeds of million  received proceeds from shares issued of million and made principal payments on its term debt of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   long term debt  including the current portion  increased million to million from million in the fiscal year ending march   including million of new loans offset by million in scheduled principal payments  as well as a million decrease due to the weaker canadian dollar 
in addition  the company received a seller note and deferred payment liabilities valued at million in connection with the acquisition of two vessels in the fiscal year ended march  the company paid million towards the seller s note and deferred payment liabilities during the year ended march  on september   the company completed a public underwritten offering of  shares of the company s common stock for per share

failure of black creek or the guarantor to comply with any of these covenants or financial ratios could result in the loans under the black creek credit agreement being accelerated 
the company met those financial covenants during the fiscal year ended march  seasonality lower lakes operates in a cyclical industry  primarily due to the typical cold weather patterns on the great lakes from december through march which cause lock closures  waterway ice  and customer facility closings  which typically shut down shipping for a period of up to days commencing from late december to mid january  and continuing until late march 
lower lakes also experiences a cyclical pattern for its capital spending cycle  typically off season from the shipping revenues  to permit annual maintenance and investment in the vessels 
this places additional adverse pressures on lower lakes liquidity and capital resources 
such winter work  capital expenditure  and drydocking costs are incurred during a period when customer collections have ended from the prior season  and fit out and vessel operating costs will be incurred at the beginning of the season as much as to days prior to the receipt of significant customer collections 
to counter these negative working capital cycles  lower lakes second amended and restated credit facility includes a revolver feature with a seasonal overadvance facility which provides working capital from the march through july period  after which customer collections typically exceed cash disbursements

the accrued dividend payable at march  was million compared to million at march  as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was 
as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was 
the dividend rate increased to a cap of effective july  until such time as the accrued dividends are paid in cash 
the company is limited in the payment of preferred stock dividends by the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the company s second amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  the company has made the decision to make its investments in its vessels before applying cash to pay preferred stock dividends 
under the terms of the preferred stock  upon the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock  a subordinated promissory note will be issued whereby the cash dividends will accrue at the rates set for the preferred stock and the note must be paid at the earlier of the second anniversary of the conversion or seven years from the initial issuance date of the preferred stock 
investments in capital expenditures and drydockings we incurred million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended march   including million relating to carryover from the winter season  compared to million  including a carryover of from the winter season  in the fiscal year ended march  the company completed the repowering of the michipicoten on may  and the vessel is now fully operational 
the company took the vessel out of service in december this project cost approximately million 
the benefits of the conversion include increased revenues from higher speeds and lower costs from reduced fuel consumption  labor  maintenance and other operating expenses

on july   lower lakes acquired a canadian flagged dry bulk carrier for cdn million with borrowings under the canadian term loan 
on september   lower lakes towing and grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement with us united ocean service  llc usuos pursuant to which lower lakes towing agreed to purchase a bulk carrier from usuos for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard such bulk carrier at the closing of the acquisition 
we completed the acquisition of such bulk carrier on october  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the equity offering described above under liquidity and capital resources to fund deferred drydock costs and improvements to such bulk carrier 
also on september   grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement the tug agreement with usuos pursuant to which grand river purchased a tug the tug from usuos for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard the tug at the closing of the acquisition 
we completed the acquisition of the tug on december  additionally  on september   grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement the barge agreement with usuos pursuant to which usuos granted grand river the option to act as usuos s third party designee to purchase a self unloading barge the barge for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard the barge at the closing of the acquisition

foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to the currency related translation of various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   our liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term borrowings in canada and there was no balance of revolving borrowings in canada 
although we have tried to match our indebtedness and cash flows from earnings by country  a sudden increase in the canadian dollar exchange rates could increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before operating cash flows can make up for such a currency conversion change 
from a cash flow perspective  our operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and our operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  a large portion of our financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars which exposes us to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates associated with revolving our indebtedness under our second amended and restated credit agreement  which carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for approximately of our combined lower lakes and black creek term loans for the remaining term of such loans based on three month ba rates for the canadian term loans and three month us libor rates for the us term loans 
the rates on these instruments  prior to the addition of the lender s margin  are on the canadian term loans  and on the us term loans 
we will be exposed to interest rate risk under our interest rate swap contracts if such contracts are required to be amended or terminated earlier than their termination dates 
off balance sheet arrangements on august   in connection with the entry into a contract of affreightment with voyageur maritime transport limited voyageur and voyageur maritime trading inc vmt and an option agreement with vmt  lower lakes towing entered into a guarantee the guarantee with ge canada finance holding company ge canada  pursuant to which lower lakes towing agreed to guarantee up to cdn million the guaranteed obligations of voyageur s indebtedness to ge canada  with lower lakes towing s obligations becoming due and payable should voyageur fail to meet certain financial covenants under the terms of its loan from ge canada or if voyageur breached certain of its obligations under the coa 
lower lakes towing s maximum future payments under the guarantee were limited to the guaranteed obligations plus the costs and expenses ge canada incurred while enforcing its rights under the guarantee

lower lakes towing had several options available to it in the event that ge canada intended to draw under the guarantee  including i the right to exercise its option for the trader under the option agreement and ii the right to make a subordinated secured loan to voyageur in an amount at least equal to the amount intended to be drawn by ge canada on terms as were reasonably satisfactory to ge canada and voyageur 
in connection with the guarantee and due to voyageur s failure to meet its obligations under its financing arrangements with ge canada  on may   general electric capital corporation delivered a notice to lower lakes that effective as of may   ge canada had drawn the full amount available under the letter of credit  with the cdn million added to lower lakes revolving borrowings under its credit facility 
ge canada  in its capacity as a lender to voyageur  placed the maritime trader the trader into receivership and auctioned the vessel in accordance with the laws of ontario 
voyageur was previously determined to be a variable interest entity of the company under us gaap 
we believe that voyageur ceased to be a vie of the company when ge canada seized the trader pursuant to ontario law and placed the subsidiary that owns the trader under liquidation in the federal court of canada effective march  due to voyageur s failure to pay principal and interest due to ge canada in february on july   lower lakes completed the acquisition of the trader pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement  dated as of july   by and between the company and marcon international inc  in its capacity as court appointed seller of the vessel 
we were never the primary beneficiary of voyageur  and did not receive any material margin for the shipments made on the trader  since the relationship was an industry standard charter relationship 
the company provided no loan support or liquidity to voyageur during the fiscal year ended march  lack of historical operating data for acquired vessels from time to time  as opportunities arise and depending on the availability of financing  we may acquire additional secondhand drybulk carriers 
consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is typically no historical financial due diligence process conducted when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  in such circumstances  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make vessel acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our stock in assessing our business or profitability 
consistent with shipping industry practice  we generally treat the acquisition of a vessel as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
in cases where a vessel services a contract of affreightment with a third party customer and the buyer desires to acquire such contract  the seller generally cannot transfer the contract to the buyer without the customer s consent 
the purchase of a vessel itself typically does not transfer the contracts of affreightment serviced by such vessel because such contracts are separate service agreements between the vessel owner and its customers 
where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we allocate the purchase price of acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values 
when we purchase a vessel and assume or renegotiate contracts of affreightment associated with the vessel  we must take the following steps before the vessel will be ready to commence operations obtain the customer s consent to us as the new owner if applicable  arrange for a new crew for the vessel  replace all hired equipment on board  such as gas cylinders and communication equipment  negotiate and enter into new insurance contracts for the vessel through our own insurance brokers  and implement a new planned maintenance program for the vessel 
the following discussion is intended to provide an understanding of how acquisitions of vessels affect our business and results of operations 
our business is comprised of the following main elements employment and operation of our drybulk vessels  scheduling our vessels to satisfy customer s contracts of affreightment  and management of the financial  general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our drybulk vessels 
the employment and operation of our vessels requires the following main components vessel maintenance and repair  crew selection and training  vessel spares and stores supply  planning and undergoing drydocking  special surveys and other major repairs  organizing and undergoing regular classification society surveys  contingency response planning  onboard safety procedures auditing  accounting  vessel insurance arrangement  vessel scheduling  vessel security training and security response plans isps  obtain ism certification and audit for each vessel within six months of taking over a vessel  vessel hire management  vessel surveying  and vessel performance monitoring 
the management of financial  general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires the following main components management of our financial resources  including banking relationships eg  administration of bank loans  management of our accounting system and records and financial reporting  administration of the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets  and management of the relationships with our service providers and customers 
the principal factors that affect our profitability  cash flows and stockholders return on investment include rates of contracts of affreightment and charterhire  scheduling to match vessels with customer requirements  including dock limitation  vessel trade patterns and backhaul opportunities  weather conditions  vessel incidents  levels of vessel operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  financing costs  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
critical accounting policies rand s significant accounting policies are presented in note to its audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
revenue and operating expenses recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin destination and cargo carried 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are less than of total revenue 
marine operating expenses such as crewing costs  fuel  tugs and insurance are recognized as incurred or consumed and thereby are recognized ratably in each reporting period 
repairs and maintenance and certain other insignificant costs are recognized as incurred 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
costs for subcontracted freight providers  presented as outside voyage charter fees in the consolidated statements of operations  are recognized as incurred and therefore are recognized ratably over the voyage 
the company accounts for sales taxes imposed on its services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  all revenues are presented on a gross basis 
vessel acquisitions vessels are stated at cost  which consists of the purchase price and any material expenses incurred upon acquisition  such as initial repairs  improvements  delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage 
subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life  increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels 
significant financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are also capitalized and included in the vessels cost 
otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names and customer relationships and contracts 
intangible assets are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related debt  which approximates the effective interest method 
impairment of fixed assets fixed assets eg property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets eg customer lists are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event that indicates the carrying value of such an asset or asset groups eg tugs and barges  might be no longer recoverable 
examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset s  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business  and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
once a triggering event has occurred  the recoverability test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset s for continued use or to hold the asset s for sale 
if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use  the recoverability test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows excluding interest expense  against the carrying value of the asset s as an initial test 
if the carrying value of such asset s exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset s would be deemed to be impaired 
impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the fixed or amortizing intangible asset and the carrying value of such asset s 
the company generally determines fair value by using the discounted cash flow method 
if the intent is to hold the asset s for sale and certain other criteria are met ie  the asset s can be disposed of currently  appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an actively pursuing buyer  the impairment test is a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its fair value less costs to sell 
to the extent that the carrying value is greater than the asset s fair value less costs to sell  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the twelve month period ended march  impairment of goodwill the company annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment may exist 
accounting standards codification asc intangibles goodwill and other and accounting standards update asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which was adopted march   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a three step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined  based on qualitative factors  to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then entities are required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of the company s two reporting units  which are the company s canadian and us operations excluding the parent  are determined using various valuation techniques with the primary techniques being a discounted cash flow analysis and peer analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the company s forecast and long term estimates 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the third step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
as of march   the company conducted the qualitative assessment and determined that the fair value of its two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and the remaining two step impairment testing was therefore not necessary 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the twelve month period ended march  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
the company adopted accounting guidance surrounding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january   which had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because management concluded that the tax benefits related to the company s uncertain tax positions can be fully recognized 
the company classifies interest expense related to income tax liabilities  when applicable  as part of the interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations rather than income tax expense 
to date  the company has not incurred material interest expenses or penalties relating to assessed taxation amounts 
there have been no recent examinations by the us taxing authorities 
the company was examined by the canadian taxing authority for the tax years and and such examination is now complete 
this audit did not result in any material adjustments for such periods
