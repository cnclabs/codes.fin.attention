overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical caregivers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks 
these services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules  quality measurement and reporting  clinical documentation and data exchange  patient communication and referrals  and many of the related tasks that distract medical providers and staff from the practice of medicine 
our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud based platform  athenanet 
we differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenanet to clients without any action on the part of the client 
athenanet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time 
the services provided through our single instance cloud are currently packaged as four integrated components athenacollector for revenue cycle management  athenaclinicals for electronic health record management  athenacommunicator for patient communication management and athenacoordinator for referral cycle management 
the use of our single instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing rules engine and our clinical quality management engine 
our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network 
our business intelligence application  anodyne analytics  also supports our clients in their pursuit of financial health by equipping users with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance 
each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components software  knowledge  and work 
the cloud based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients  payers  and our staff of experts 
knowledge is infused into each of our services via our rules engine as we work with clients  payers  and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement  clinical quality measures  and other factors related to our clients performance 
the third component to each of our services is the work that we perform on behalf of our clients 
wherever possible  we replace manual processes with automation  but where automation is not possible  we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed 
this unique service model of software  knowledge  and work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance  creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency 
we charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases  so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices 
in  we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services compared to million in and million in given the scope of our market opportunity  we have increased our spending each year on growth  innovation  and infrastructure 
despite increased spending in these areas  higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater operating income 

table of contents our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
this revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients  so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians and the number of services purchased 
to provide these services  we incur expense in several categories  including direct operating  selling and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expense 
in general  our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases  whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients 
our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future  our overall business management activities  and our infrastructure 
we manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity  in adherence to related financial covenants 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources from business services associated with our revenue cycle management  electronic health record management  patient communication management  care coordination and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services 
implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services 
business services accounted for approximately of our total revenues for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
business services fees are typically to of a practice s total collections depending upon the services used and the size  complexity  and other characteristics of the practice  plus a per statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients of certain clients 
accordingly  business services fees are largely driven by the number of physician practices we serve  the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices  the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians and other medical providers  the services used by the practice and our contracted rates 
there is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices 
typically  discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about to days later 
additionally  the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity  length and timing of the onset of the flu season 
while we believe that the severity  length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients  there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns 
implementation and other revenue are largely driven by the increase in the volume of new business 
as a result  we expect implementation and other revenue to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue 
none of our clients accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december    or operating expense direct operating expense 
direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  claim processing costs  other direct costs  and stock based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients  including staff who implement new clients 
we expense implementation costs as incurred 
we include in direct operating expense all service costs associated with athenacollector  athenaclinicals  athenacommunicator  athenacoordinator and anodyne analytics 
we expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation  with higher volumes of work in particular functions  geographies  and medical specialties 
although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future  the direct operating expense is expected in the long term to decline as a percentage of revenues as we increase automation 
additionally  in the near term  we expect that the percentage of direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will slightly increase until we fully integrate our newly acquired business and automate our new care coordinator offering 
direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  depreciation  and amortization  except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets 

table of contents selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs including trade shows  brand messaging  and on line initiatives and personnel related expense for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  commissions  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense 
although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered  we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence 
accordingly  we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients and expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas  such as attending trade shows  expanding user groups  and creating new printed materials 
as a result  we expect that  in the near term  sales and marketing expense will increase at the same rate as revenue growth 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses for research and development employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense and consulting fees for third party developers 
we expect that  in the near term  research and development expense will increase in absolute terms and will likely increase as a percentage of total revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expense for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  and insurance premiums  software as a service fees  outside professional fees for accountants  lawyers  and consultants  and compensation for temporary employees 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth 
though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms  we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs  which we amortize over a two year period from the time of release of related software code 
as we grow  we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business  and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize 
in the near term we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
other income expense 
interest expense has historically consisted of interest costs related to our equipment related term leases  our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility  offset by interest income on investments 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the gain loss on the interest rate derivative contract represented the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge 
as we repaid all capital leases  the term loan and terminated the interest rate derivative contract in may  we expect that our interest expense will be insignificant until such time we determined it is appropriate to draw down on our new financing arrangements 
income tax provision 
income tax provision consists of federal and state income taxes in the united states and india 
the difference between our effective tax rate and statutory rate is mainly related to the treatment of incentive stock options isos as permanent differences 
we substantially ceased issuing isos in and expect that the difference between the effective tax rate and our federal and state statutory rates will be nominal as the previously issued isos vest and possibly become disqualified dispositions 

table of contents recent developments on october   the company entered into a credit agreement that provides for a five year million revolving credit facility revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement replaces the million credit agreement that expired september  the terms and conditions of the revolving credit agreement are customary to facilities of this nature 
on august   the company acquired proxsys llc proxsys 
the acquisition broadens the company s offerings by bringing order transmission  pre certification and pre registration capabilities to the company s service platform 
the results of proxsys s operations are included in the statement of operations of the combined entity since the date of acquisition 
consideration for this transaction was million plus potential additional consideration of million which will be paid over a two year period if proxsys achieves certain business and financial milestones 
as of december   we have not paid any amounts associated with the additional consideration 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  including our estimated expected customer life  asset impairments  depreciable lives of assets  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales  fair value of contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition we derive our revenue from business services associated with revenue cycle management  electronic health record management  patient communication management  care coordination and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
our clients typically purchase one year contracts that renew automatically upon completion 
in most cases  our clients may terminate their agreements with days notice without cause 
we typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly  in arrears  based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenanet  minimum fees  flat fees  or per claim fees where applicable 
invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email 
for most of our clients  fees are then deducted from a pre defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto debit transaction 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 
the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
all revenue  other than implementation revenue  is recognized when the service is performed 
relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers  we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid 
each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the company considers a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  the company s revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
deliverables not meeting the 
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion 
the appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting 
the company allocates arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
the company determines selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if it exists  otherwise  the company uses third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  the company uses estimated selling price 
we recognize our non refundable up front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life  whichever is longer 
as the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services  we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete  at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life 
the determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life 
we determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors renewal rate considerations economic life of the product or service industry data the estimated customer life  or expected performance period  for the years presented is years 
our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period 
for example  if in the future  we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease 
on the other hand  if in the future  we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase 
the amount of deferred revenue related to non refundable up front fees is million as of december  
table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions business combinations purchased intangibles and contingent consideration business combinations  including purchased intangibles and contingent consideration  are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses 
all changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results and earn out targets related to estimating the value of the contingent considerations 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
we review acquired intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
future business and economic conditions  as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions  could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill and intangibles  acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangibles which are finite lived assets or changes in fair value of the contingent consideration from the date of acquisition 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the estimates of earn out results 
we have million and million carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles  as of december   respectively 
we have a liability of million of contingent consideration related to million in potential payments as of december   related to both the anodyne and proxsys business combinations 
the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of million related to the anodyne acquisition in october to date  the company has paid out a total of million and adjusted the fair value by million due to change in the assumptions  and other factors related to anodyne 
the balance as of december   was million related to the remaining million in potential payments related to anodyne that will be settled in the first half of the initial purchase price allocation at estimated fair value of million related to the proxsys acquisition in august of to date  the company has not paid out any amounts or adjusted the fair value related to proxsys

our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal rates with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections 
we may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies  in which case we may need to borrow against our revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facility or obtain additional financing

as of december   we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december    and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations

we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and total available for sale investments totaling million at december  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits  money market funds  and available for sale  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short and expected term of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the value of these securities  however  will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility
