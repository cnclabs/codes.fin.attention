item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposit renewals or rollovers  secured or unsecured borrowings  the sale of securities or loans 
table of contents and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or under terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely primarily on commercial and retail deposits and to a lesser extent  brokered deposit renewals and rollovers  advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of topeka and other secured and unsecured borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb of topeka or market conditions were to change 
in addition  if we fall below the fdic s thresholds to be considered well capitalized  we will be unable to continue to rollover or renew brokered funds  and the interest rate paid on deposits would be restricted 
under the written agreement  the bank was required to submit a written plan to improve the bank s liquidity position  including measures to diversify funding sources and reduce reliance on brokered deposits 
the written agreement also restricts the bank from issuing new brokered deposits  but the bank can continue to renew or rollover existing brokered deposits 
we have significantly reduced our level of brokered deposits during by choosing not to renew approximately million of matured brokered deposits 
this limits our ability to utilize brokered deposits as a significant funding source until we are no longer subject to the written agreement 
further  the written agreement prevents the company  but not the bank  from incurring  increasing or guaranteeing any debt without approval from the federal reserve 
although we consider the current sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
likewise  the company may seek written approval from the federal reserve to issue additional debt in the future 
there can be no assurance that such written approval would be obtained for additional borrowings at the holding company level  or that the additional borrowings would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
in addition  although we believe that the current level of cash at the holding company is sufficient to meet the operating needs of the holding company for over three years  assuming that the holding company does not contribute any additional amounts of capital to the bank  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled in the future to seek either additional capital or dividends from the bank to meet such needs 
there can be no assurance that we could raise additional capital or that written approval would be obtained from our regulators for any such dividends 
bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to years prior to the recent economic downturn 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal  and since september  nearly all of our overnight funding is held at the federal reserve in order to mitigate risk associated with holding large amounts of cash with other financial institutions 
nonetheless  we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by 
table of contents adverse conditions in the financial markets 
from time to time  a portion of the balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the us may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
concern of customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits with recent influx of bank failures  including several in colorado  customers have become more concerned and aware about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic 
as a result  customers may either withdraw deposits or elect not to increase their deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured 
decreases in deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income 
our deposit insurance premiums could increase in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund dif at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the dif 
effective april   the fdic implemented new rules required by the dodd frank act with respect to the fdic assessments 
in particular  the definition of an institution s deposit insurance assessment base was changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity 
in addition  the fdic revised the deposit insurance assessment rates down 
the new initial base assessment rates range from to basis points for category i banks to basis points for category iv banks 
category ii and iii banks have an initial base assessment rate of or basis points  respectively 
in addition  the fdic adopted a new restoration plan  pursuant to which  among other things  the fdic has foregone the uniform basis point increase in initial assessment rates that was scheduled to take effect on january   plans to maintain the current schedule of assessment rates  has pursued further rulemaking regarding the method that will be used to offset the effect on banks with less than billion in assets of the requirement that the reserve ratio reach and at least semiannually  will update its projections for the dif and increase or decrease assessment rates  if needed 
while based upon the new restoration plan and the new rulemaking  current initial base assessment rates are not expected to be increased in the near future  there can be no assurance that the fdic will not increase assessment rates in the future or that the bank will not be subject to higher assessment rates as a result of a change in its risk category  which could have an adverse effect on the bank s earnings 
in addition  the fdic may terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated applicable laws  regulations or orders 
in the case of a colorado chartered bank  the termination of deposit insurance would result in the revocation of its charter 
to reduce our level of nonperforming loans  we may elect to sell loans to third parties  which could result in losses for the bank we may elect to sell loans or packages of loans to third parties 
such sales may be at prices below the carrying value of the loans  which would require the immediate recognition of additional losses and reduce our capital levels 

table of contents we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but capital may not be available when it is needed we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect to raise additional capital 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital as a result of deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors  which may diminish our ability to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be assured of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  we may become subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and our business  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by continued disruptions in securities markets the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has become volatile over the past several years 
volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
our mortgage backed portfolio may be subject to extension risk as interest rates rise and borrowers are unable to refinance their current mortgages into lower rate mortgages  extending the average life of the bonds 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us since mid  the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we may not realize our deferred income tax assets 
in addition  our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code the company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences 
we review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income 
this review uses historical results  projected future operating results based upon approved business plans  eligible carryforward and carryback periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the us and our industry may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets 
such changes could result in material non cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the benefit of our built in losses would be reduced if we experience an ownership change  as determined under internal revenue code section section 
a section ownership change occurs if a stockholder or a group of stockholders who are deemed to own at least of our common stock increase their ownership by more than percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three year period 
if an ownership change occurs  section would impose an annual limit on the amount of built in losses we can use to reduce our taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity immediately prior to the ownership change reduced by certain items specified in section and the federal long term tax exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change 
a number of complex rules apply to calculating this annual limit 
while the complexity of section s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded stock make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has occurred  we currently believe that an ownership change has not occurred 
however  if an ownership change were to occur  the annual limit section may impose could result in a limitation of the annual deductibility of our built in losses 
tax law changes may adversely affect our net income  effective tax rate and our overall results of operations and financial condition the company s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws 
given the current economic and political environment  and ongoing state budgetary pressures  the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation may occur 
the enactment of such legislation  or changes in the interpretation of existing law  including provisions impacting tax rates  apportionment  consolidation or combination  income  expenses  and credits  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination 
any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us  or in banking regulators supervisory policies or examination procedures  whether by the colorado division of banking  the fdic  the federal reserve board  other state or federal regulators  the us congress or the colorado legislature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the bank is subject to regulations promulgated by the colorado division of banking  as its chartering authority  and by the fdic as the insurer of its deposits up to certain limits 
the bank also belongs to the federal home loan bank system and  as a member  is subject to certain limited regulations promulgated by the federal home loan bank of topeka 
in addition  the federal reserve 
table of contents board regulates and oversees guaranty bancorp as a bank holding company  and the bank  as a member of the federal reserve system 
this regulation and supervision limits the activities in which we may engage 
the purpose of regulation and supervision is primarily to protect the fdic s insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers  rather than our stockholders 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers 
they may  among other things  impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution  the classification of assets by such institution and such institution s allowance for loan losses 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the red flag identity theft rules under the fair and accurate credit transactions act and colorado s deceptive acts and practices law 
these laws also permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in certain instances 
given the recent economic downturn and related legislative initiatives  new regulations and laws that may affect us are increasingly likely 
compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the written agreement also subjects us to additional restrictions and more frequent oversight 
no assurance can be given that the foregoing regulations and supervision will not change so as to affect us adversely 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the colorado front range our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct business 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the colorado front range  which includes the denver metropolitan area 
the local economic conditions in our market area have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  natural disasters  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further deterioration in economic conditions  in particular within our primary market areas  could result in the following consequences  among others  any of which could hurt our business materially loan delinquencies on real estate  commercial and consumer loans may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  and collateral for loans made by us  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral securing our loans 
in view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in colorado s front range  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of any of these consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business our business activities and credit exposure are primarily concentrated along the front range of colorado 
as of december   approximately of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
substantially all of our real estate loans are located in colorado 
while we do not have any sub prime loans  our construction  land development and land loan portfolio  along with our commercial and multi family loan portfolios and certain of our other loans  have been affected by the recent downturn in the residential and commercial real estate market 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
we anticipate that further declines in the real estate markets in our primary market areas would affect our business 
if real estate 
table of contents values continue to decline  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
as a result  our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate will be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
the events and conditions described in this risk factor could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our small to medium sized business target markets may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy we target the banking and financial services needs of small and medium sized businesses 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions continue to negatively impact these businesses in the markets in which we operate  our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be adversely affected 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks from time to time  we may implement new delivery systems  such as internet banking  or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
in developing and marketing new delivery systems and or new products and services  we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we serve 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
additionally  we expect competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent acquisition of failed institutions in our market area by other competing  out of state financial institutions 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
the ability to expand our market position 
the ability to retain qualified staff  including those with key customer relationships 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary to fund company expenses and dividends because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank  we currently depend upon dividends from the bank for a substantial portion of our revenues and to fund the holding company s expenses 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions of the delaware general corporation law 
various banking laws applicable to the bank limit the payment of dividends  management fees and other distributions by the bank to the company  and may therefore limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  the written agreement prohibits both the company and the bank from paying dividends without the prior written approval of the federal reserve  and  in the case of the bank  the cdb 
accordingly  our ability to receive dividends from the bank  as well as our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will be restricted until the written agreement is terminated 
from time to time  we may become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividends for more information on these restrictions 
although we believe that the current level of cash at the holding company is sufficient to meet the operating needs of the holding company for over three years  assuming that the holding company does not contribute any additional amounts of capital to the bank  there can be no assurance in this regard and we may be compelled in the future to seek either additional capital or dividends from the bank to meet such needs 
there can be no assurance that we could raise additional capital or that written approval would be obtained from our regulators for any such dividends 
under the terms of our trust preferred securities  including our related subordinated debentures  issued on september   february   june  and april   we cannot declare or pay any dividends or distributions other than stock dividends on  or redeem  purchase  acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to  any shares of our capital stock if an event of default under any of the subordinated debenture agreements has occurred and is continuing  or if we defer payment of interest on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to sixty consecutive months as long as we are in compliance with all covenants of the agreement 
on july   we elected to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on each of our subordinated debentures until further 
table of contents notice 
in addition  we are currently restricted from making payments of principal or interest on our subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities under the terms of our written agreement without the prior approval of the federal reserve 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm our business competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the colorado community banking industry 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of and customer relationships developed by our management and personnel 
in particular  our success is highly dependent upon the abilities of our senior executive management 
we believe this management team  comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years  is integral to implementing our business plan 
the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm our business 
to mitigate the potential impact of a loss of key personnel  the company has a management succession plan to ensure that our business plan continues to be effectively executed 
under the terms of the written agreement  prior written approval from the federal reserve must be obtained prior to appointing any new director or senior executive officer  or changing the responsibilities of any senior executive officer so that the officer would assume a different senior executive officer position 
there is no assurance that written approval would be granted to appoint any new director or senior executive officer  or to change the responsibilities of any senior executive officer 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal risk and compliance risk  and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems 
if personal  non public  confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused  we could suffer significant regulatory consequences  reputational damage and financial loss 
such mishandling or misuse could include  for example  if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information  either by fault of our systems  employees  or counterparties  or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified 
our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large 
table of contents transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  or natural disasters  disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets  which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that we or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example  by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect  as well as potential liability to clients  reputational damage and regulatory intervention  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
in particular  we are subject to security  transactional and operational risks relating to the use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business serving both internal and customer constituencies 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures  security applications and fraud mitigation applications  designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption  fraud attacks or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions  fraud attacks or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
additionally  we outsource our data processing to a third party 
if our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party  it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions  which would significantly affect our business operations 
furthermore  breaches of such third party s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers  through no fault of our own 
fraud attacks targeting customer controlled devices  plastic payment card terminals  and merchant data collection points provide another source of potential loss  again through no fault of our own 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we continually encounter technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for our products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face risks associated with acquisitions or mergers we may pursue or be a party to an acquisition or merger opportunity in the future 
risks commonly encountered in mergers and acquisitions include  among other things the difficulty of integrating the operations  systems and personnel of acquired companies and branches 
the potential disruption of our ongoing business 
the potential diversion of our management s time and attention 
the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems 
the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management 
the potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company 
exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired or merged company 
the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired or merged company 
difficulty in estimating the value of the acquired or merged company 
potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the acquired or merged company 
environmental liability with acquired loans  and their collateral  or with any real estate 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with mergers or acquisitions 
our integration of operations of banks or branches that we acquire may not be successfully accomplished and may take a significant amount of time 
our inability to improve the operating performance of acquired banks and branches or to integrate successfully or in a timely manner their operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we would expect to hire additional employees and or retain consultants to assist with integrating our operations  and we cannot assure that those individuals or firms will perform as expected or be successful in addressing these issues 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title in the course of our business  we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to 
table of contents investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  cash flows  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our common stock an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you could lose some or all of your investment 
concentrated ownership of our stock may discourage a change in control and have an adverse effect on the share price of our voting common stock and also can influence stockholder decisions as of february   executive officers  directors and stockholders of more than of our common stock beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control and may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our voting common stock 
in addition  as a result of their ownership  executive officers  directors and stockholders of more than of our common stock may have the ability to influence the outcome of any matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors 
our stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for investors to resell our common stock when desired and at attractive prices 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and or our competitors  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts

table of contents the trading volume in our voting common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies although our voting common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market  the trading volume in our voting common stock is less than that of other  larger financial services companies  and investors are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our voting common stock 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our voting common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control

the holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders we currently have outstanding an aggregate of million in junior subordinated debentures in connection with trust preferred securities issuances by our statutory trust subsidiaries 
we conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
our junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
we may issue additional securities  which could dilute your ownership percentage 
in certain situations  our board of directors has the authority  without any vote of our stockholders  to issue shares of our authorized but unissued stock 
in the future  we may issue additional securities  through public or private offerings  to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions 
any such issuance would dilute the ownership of current holders of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the disclosure regarding forward looking statements and factors that could affect future results set forth in the beginning of part i of this report  as well as the discussion set forth in item a 
risk factors and item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we are a bank holding company providing banking and other financial services throughout our targeted colorado markets to consumers and to small and medium sized businesses  including the owners and employees of those businesses 
we offer an array of banking products and services to the communities we serve  including accepting time and demand deposits and originating loans including commercial  energy  real estate  small business and consumer loans 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing loan and deposit accounts and fees from private banking and trust services 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely primarily on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating exclusively or primarily in colorado  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in colorado  including the strength of the local real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guaranty bancorp has a single bank subsidiary  guaranty bank and trust company 
this structure is a result of a combination of four separate acquisitions in and and two divestitures in as detailed in item business  centennial bank holdings  inc became guaranty bancorp effective may  application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and consistently applied from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies that we believe are critical or involve significant management judgment 
allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we determine probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio and establish an allowance for those losses by considering factors including historical loss rates  expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
in assessing these factors  we use organizational history and experience with credit decisions and related outcomes 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate based on subsequent loss evaluations  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted 

table of contents we estimate the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses by separately evaluating impaired and non impaired loans 
a specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral do not justify the carrying amount of the loan 
the methodology used to assign an allowance to a non impaired loan is more subjective 
generally  the allowance assigned to non impaired loans is determined by applying historical loss rates by portfolio segment to existing loans with similar risk characteristics  adjusted for qualitative factors including the volume and severity of identified classified loans  changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
because the economic and business climate in any given industry or market  and its impact on any given borrower  can change rapidly  the risk profile of the loan portfolio is continually assessed and adjusted when appropriate 
notwithstanding these procedures  there still exists the possibility that our assessment could prove to be significantly incorrect and that an immediate adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would be required 
we estimate the appropriate level of loan loss allowance by conducting a detailed review of a number of smaller portfolio segments that comprise our loan portfolio 
we segment the loan portfolio into as many components as practical 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving  while the risk profile of others may be deteriorating 
as a result  changes in the appropriate level of the allowance for different segments may offset one another 
adjustments to the allowance represent the aggregate impact from the analysis of all loan segments 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  the valuation allowance is adjusted through a charge to noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and recognized in noninterest expense 
investment in debt and equity securities we classify our investments in debt and equity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities classified as held to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques  including extrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities  fundamental analysis  discounted cash flow analysis  or through obtaining purchase quotes 
due to the subjective nature of the valuation process  it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts  thereby affecting our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost  we evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if such an event or change has occurred and we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we expense the impairment of the investment in the period in which the event or change occurred 

table of contents deferred income tax assets liabilities our net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income 
from an accounting standpoint  deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on both positive and negative evidence currently available 
positive evidence includes the historical levels of our taxable income  estimates of our future taxable income including tax planning strategies  the reversals of deferred tax liabilities and taxes available in carry back years 
negative evidence primarily includes a cumulative three year loss for financial reporting purposes 
additionally  current and future economic and business conditions are considered 
additionally  the company reviews its uncertain tax positions annually 
an uncertain tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount actually recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
a significant amount of judgment is applied to determine both whether the tax position meets the more likely than not test as well as to determine the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized 
differences between the position taken by management and that of taxing authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or increase to tax liability  which could adversely affect future income tax expense 
intangible assets core deposit and customer relationships  which are intangible assets with a finite life  are recorded on our balance sheets 
these intangible assets were capitalized as a result of past acquisitions and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to years 
core deposit intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
core deposits were tested for impairment during and and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
this discussion has highlighted those accounting policies that we consider to be critical to our financial reporting process 
however  all the accounting policies are important  and therefore you are encouraged to review each of the policies included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements in
