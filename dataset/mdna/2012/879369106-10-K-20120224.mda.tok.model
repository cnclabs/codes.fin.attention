we primarily design  develop  manufacture and supply single use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications 
we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors 
our products are used in a wide variety of markets and are not dependent upon any one end market or procedure 
we provide a broad based platform of products  which we categorize into four product groups critical care  surgical care  cardiac care and oem and development services 
over the past several years we have focused on transitioning to a pure play medical technology company through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program and focused our resources on the development of our healthcare business 
we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses  expanding our presence in the medical technology industry  while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets 
the most significant of these transactions occurred in with our acquisition of arrow international  a leading global supplier of catheter based medical technology products used for vascular access and critical care  and the divestiture of our automotive and industrial businesses 
below is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since with respect to divested businesses listed below  we have reported results of operations  cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented

health care reform on march  the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law 
while providing some clarity on the impact of reform to our industry  this legislation will have a significant impact on our business 
for medical device companies such as teleflex  the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture  but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare  which could negatively affect pricing of our products 
in addition  commencing in  the legislation imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices 
as this new law is implemented  we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business 
we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately million annually  beginning in also in the first quarter of  we evaluated the change in the tax regulations related to the medicare part d subsidy as currently outlined in the new legislation and determined that it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
global economic conditions global economic conditions since have had adverse impacts on market activities including  among other things  failure of financial institutions  falling asset values  diminished liquidity  and reduced demand for products and services 
in response  we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of and in the first half of although  on a consolidated basis  the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity over the last three years  the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth  constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future  as described below 
the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we serve a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries 
healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country  and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last three years 

table of contents hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions  a weaker payor mix  and a reduction in elective procedures 
hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs  including limiting their capital spending 
distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during and generally have not replenished inventories to pre recession levels 
the impact of these actions is most pronounced in capital goods markets  which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses 
our orthopedic oem business was impacted in by delayed new product launches by our oem customers 
more recently  this situation has improved somewhat  but has not returned to pre recession levels 
approximately percent of our net revenues come from single use products used in critical care and surgical applications  and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 
in europe  some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate 
elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced 
in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process 
these markets have introduced more buying groups and group purchasing organizations  or gpos  resulting in reductions in commodity product pricing 
it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs 
during and continuing into  the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe  most notably greece  spain  portugal and italy  have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions  which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us 
we believe this situation will continue and may worsen unless and until these countries are able to find alternative means of funding their respective public healthcare sectors 
in  net revenues in these countries accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues and of our consolidated account receivable  net 
in asia  recovery from the global recession has varied by country 
china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier cities hospitals  which may provide future growth opportunities for us  while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market 
results of operations the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the cargo systems  cargo container  marine  actuation  heavy lift  ssi  ati and power systems businesses which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and discontinued operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of discontinued operations 
revenues discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered constant currency revenue growth 
constant currency revenue growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period and the comparable activity of businesses divested within the most recent twelve month period

our ability to increase prices to offset the impact of higher commodity costs has been mixed  as price increases in asia  latin america and north america were offset by price erosion in europe during gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in from in the increase was principally due to sales volume growth related to higher margin products  particularly in europe

table of contents restructuring and other impairment charges dollars in millions restructuring program arrow integration program aggregate impairment charges investments and certain fixed assets total restructuring program during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program at four facilities to consolidate operations and reduce costs 
in connection with this program  we recorded contract termination costs of approximately million associated with a lease termination  as we had vacated of the premises as of december  in addition  we have recorded approximately million for employee termination benefits for workforce consolidations 
in  we expect to incur additional contract termination costs of approximately million when we have completely exited the leased facility  approximately million for facility closure costs related to the other facilities  an additional million for termination benefits and million for other costs in connection with the program 
all of the employee termination benefits  facility closure costs and other costs will be paid in the payment of the contract termination costs associated with the lease termination will continue until in connection with our acquisition of arrow in  we formulated a plan to integrate arrow and our other businesses 
the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution functions in north america  europe and asia 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow and are not included in our results of operations 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations

during  we recognized net impairment charges of million related to the decline in value of our investments in affiliates that are considered to be other than temporary 
in making this determination  we considered multiple factors  including our intent and ability to hold investments  operating losses of investees that demonstrate an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  the investee s liquidity and cash position and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
during the third quarter of  based on continued deterioration in the california real estate market  we recorded million in impairment charges to fully write off an investment in a real estate venture in california 
we initially invested in the venture in by contributing property and other assets that had been part of one of our former manufacturing sites 
for additional information regarding our restructuring programs and impairment charges  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension funding  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and access to capital markets 

table of contents we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
to date  we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers  and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs 
however  in light of the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets  including the european sovereign debt crisis  combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity 
we continue to monitor our credit risk related to countries affected by the sovereign debt issues in europe  particularly italy  spain  portugal and greece 
as of december   our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in these countries were million 
in and  net revenues from italy  spain  portugal and greece was approximately of total net revenues in those respective years 
as of december  and december   net trade receivables from these countries were approximately and  respectively  of consolidated accounts receivable  net 
if global economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience delays in customer payments  reductions in our customers purchases from us 
also  we may incur higher credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in and beyond 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 
at december   of our million of cash and cash equivalents  million was held at foreign subsidiaries 
we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and  subject to payment of additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes  these funds could be repatriated  if necessary 
any additional taxes could be offset  at least in part  by foreign tax credits 
the amount of any taxes  which could be significant  and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 
we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements  substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness  because the net cash provided by us based operating activities alone is not sufficient 
accordingly  we repatriated approximately million and million in and  respectively  of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements 
these cash distributions are subject to tax in the us at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings 
approximately million of our million of net cash provided by operating activities in was generated in the us  and approximately million of our million of net cash provided by operating activities in was generated in the us during and  we repaid approximately million and million  respectively  of debt from the proceeds of the issuance of convertible debt and our senior subordinated notes  the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations 
as a result  we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until we anticipate our domestic interest payments for will be approximately million 
to the extent we cannot  or choose not to  repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements  our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner

we used million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash to fund these payments 
revolving credit facility borrowings and repayment

we also recorded a million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of termination of interest rate swap 
in december  we terminated our interest rate swap agreement that  at the date of termination  had a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge against the term loan under our senior credit facility 
at the date of termination  the interest rate swap was in a liability position resulting in a cash payment of approximately million  which included million of accrued interest 
the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in an million cash outflow as reported in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the million is the pre tax value of the interest rate swap  the after tax value of million is recorded on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  the million will be amortized as interest expense over the term of the original hedge transaction and will be fully amortized by september 
table of contents cash flows the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from continuing operations provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents comparison of and cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million during the twelve months ended december  the decrease primarily reflects the fact that we received a significant tax refund of million in  which favorably affected cash flow in the period 
in addition  the decrease reflects a million increase in worldwide inventory levels  which was million greater than the million increase in inventory during the period 
we increased our inventory levels in principally to improve our service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders 
the inventory increase also included a million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore 
these operating cash flow decreases as compared to the prior period were somewhat offset by a modestly smaller increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the accounts receivable increase in the period was million  million less than the increase during the same period in however  million of the increase in resulted from a change in accounting guidance that caused trade receivables under our asset securitization program to be included as accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
prior to the change in accounting guidance  the trade receivables were treated as sold and were not included in our balance sheet 
the increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months of reflects higher accounts receivable in europe of million  primarily due to the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately million  and a slowdown in payments  particularly in italy and spain approximately million

the million paid for the acquisition of vasonova includes the initial payment of million plus a million contingent payment made to the former vasonova security holders upon receiving k clearance from the us food and drug administration less a hold back fee and cash in the business obtained in the acquisition 

table of contents cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations totaled million during the twelve months ended december   which included proceeds from additional borrowings of million  including the issuance of our notes

we also paid million against our securitization program  made dividend payments of million and recognized proceeds of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 
comparison of and cash flow from operating activities operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately million during  an increase of million over the comparable period in cash flow from operations in was adversely affected by a million tax payment on the sale of the ati businesses  while the increase reflects a tax refund of million and lower payments for interest and restructuring and integration programs 
the increase was partly offset by a million increase in our contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans in over the comparable period in and an increase in receivables of million that resulted from the adoption of an amendment to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  transfers and servicing asc topic in the first quarter of specifically  upon adoption of the amendment  the accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet under our securitization program are now required to be accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as short term debt on our balance sheet 
the effect of the amendment is reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows under financing activities in the increase decrease in notes payable and current borrowings and under operating activities in the accounts receivable use of cash 
underlying these activities  cash flow from continuing operations in compared to was further reduced by higher receivables primarily in europe reflecting the continued slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy  spain  portugal and greece where funding continues to be under pressure due to weak economic conditions  and higher inventories in north america in advance of the coming flu season 
cash flow from investing activities investing activities from continuing operations provided net cash of million in  primarily due to million in proceeds from the sale of ssi  million from the sale of heavy lift and million from the sale of the actuation business  partly offset by capital expenditures of million 
cash flow from financing activities financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of million in during the third quarter of  in connection with the refinancing of a portion of our long term debt  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
as part of our effort to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the issuance of our common stock and or reduce our exposure to potential cash payments we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes  we entered into hedging transactions involving the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information

during the fourth quarter of we prepaid million in aggregate principal amount of our notes  which required the payment to the noteholders of a prepayment make whole amount of million 
we also paid million of dividends 
these reductions in cash flows from financing activities were partly offset by the million increase in notes payable and current borrowings as a result of the application of the amendment to asc topic  discussed above  to our securitization program  which resulted in the reporting of the securitization program as a secured borrowing in financing arrangements the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in millions net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital fixed rate borrowings comprised of total borrowings at december  versus at december  our senior credit agreement and the indenture under which we issued our notes contain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur debt  create liens  consolidate  merge or dispose of certain assets  make certain investments  engage in acquisitions  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements 
our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally  consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement 
at december   our consolidated leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was  both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility 
this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs 
during  we borrowed million under this facility to fund the vasonova acquisition and the retirement of the notes 
the borrowings were subsequently repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the marine business and term loan borrowings 
the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit 
table of contents agreement 
moreover  additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur 
notwithstanding these restrictions  we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs 
at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december   we would have been permitted million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december  moreover  additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all other terms of our senior credit agreement and our notes  and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements  including the leverage and interest coverage ratios under our senior credit agreement  throughout for additional information regarding our indebtedness  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to million to a commercial paper conduit 
as of december   the maximum amount available for borrowing was million 
this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements 
the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events 
an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on  among other factors  cash requirements for acquisitions  cash generated from operations  debt repayment obligations  market conditions and regulatory requirements 
in addition  our senior credit facility and our notes limit our ability to repurchase shares and make other restricted payments 
accordingly  these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization 
through december   no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  are as follows total payments due by period less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands total borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations other postretirement benefits total contractual obligations interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december  
table of contents purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 
in  cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were million  and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be approximately million in due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance  changes in interest rates  changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
in light of the disruptions in global economic markets that began in the fourth quarter of and have continued through  we have engaged in a more robust customer by customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  our customers  particularly in the european region  have extended or delayed payments for products and services 
table of contents already provided  which may lead to collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these customers  specifically in greece  italy  spain and portugal  which is the primary cause for the increase in the allowance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  which was and  respectively  of gross accounts receivable 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments  we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible  we would be required to incur additional charges  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was million at december  and million at december  which equaled and of gross inventories  respectively 
the balance included the additional reserves for the sku rationalization  while included reserves of million related to discontinued operations 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
the evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets at december  were as follows total dollars in millions goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived goodwill and intangible assets number of reporting units 
table of contents intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  determinable lived intangibles eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies or goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets  primarily trademarks and brand names  are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter  using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level 
for purposes of this assessment  our reporting units are generally businesses one level below our single operating segment 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standard update asu that modified the goodwill impairment test process 
the modification permits companies to assess goodwill impairment on a qualitative basis  through the evaluation of various financial  business and economic factors  to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the customary two step process 
the modification is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we elected to adopt the modification in the fourth quarter of for our annual impairment testing and determined that four of our six reporting units  representing approximately of our total goodwill  qualified for the new approach 
the remainder of our goodwill was evaluated using the customary two step process for impairment testing 
the first step of the process is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its carrying value 
consistent with previous years  in performing the first step  we calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods  one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach 
if the fair value exceeded the carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment 
the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales  operating income  industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units  the expected long term growth rates for each of our reporting units  which approximate the expected long term growth rate of the global economy and of the industry in which the reporting units operate  discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values  which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs  determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples 
there were no changes to the underlying methods used in as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units 
the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter impairment test was performed 
table of contents over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit 
for north america and europe  middle east  and africa emea  the two reporting units that were tested under the two step goodwill impairment test  the compound growth rates for revenue were approximately and  respectively  and approximately for operating income for both reporting units 
the discount rate was for all reporting units 
a perpetual growth rate of was assumed for all reporting units 
in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  we considered the results of both the income and the market approach and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit 
in addition  our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units  plus a control premium  to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization 
the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately  which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above 
in  the fair value of our emea reporting unit exceeds its respective carrying value by more than 
the fair value of our north american reporting unit is approximately higher than its carrying value in  where the fair value had been and higher than its carrying value in and  respectively 
the million of goodwill attributed to the north america reporting unit constitutes approximately of our total goodwill 
as a result of a reorganization of our internal business unit reporting structure and related internal financial reporting  effective january   we are changing from one operating segment to four operating segments and from six reporting units to ten reporting units 
the change will include converting our current north america medical business  which will be one of the four operating segments  from one reporting unit to five reporting units 
this change in reporting units requires us to allocate the assets and liabilities of north america medical to the new reporting units  and then allocate goodwill using a relative fair value approach 
the goodwill attributable to the north america medical reporting unit was million at december  we are currently completing the allocation process  and will perform goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units in the first quarter of this could result in impairment charges being recognized for one or more of these new reporting units in the first quarter of  which could be material 
our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales  operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which  together  more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle 
as a result of this analysis  the compound annual growth rate of cash flows over the projected ten year period in the north america reporting unit is estimated to be 
under the income approach  significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test 
for example  an increase of over in the discount rate or a decrease of over percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for this reporting unit 
nevertheless  while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the constant currency revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected  and  as a result  the estimated fair value may decline 
if our strategy and or new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the north america reporting unit may become impaired and  in such case  we may incur material impairment charges 
intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly 
table of contents of technology  customer relationships  and trade names 
the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method  which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset 
under this method  an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party 
the royalty  which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset 
the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid with respect to complementary or contributory assets 
the residual profit is tax effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary 
in connection with the analysis  management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above  under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate  discount rate  and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill 
compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names ranged from to and a royalty rate of was assumed 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above  nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each our indefinite lived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by as of the date of the valuation 
we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets eg  customer relationships  instead  long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
triggering events include the likely ie  more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and re assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finite lived assets by  among other things  assessing customer attrition rates 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 

table of contents the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows pension other benefits discount rate rate of return initial healthcare trend rate ultimate healthcare trend rate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions assumed discount rate expected return on plan assets assumed healthcare trend rate basis point increase basis point decrease basis point change increase decrease dollars in millions net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense projected benefit obligation n a product warranty liability we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will  at our option  repair or replace  without charge  such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
warranty periods vary by product 
we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty 
we accrue for product warranties when  based on available information  it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold  and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in the reserve is due to the divestiture of businesses sold in distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and accrue an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
the estimate is based on a historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the previous months for specific product lines 
the accrual for estimated rebates was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense is measured using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options  volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  which is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior 
expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock  which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 

table of contents accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates  which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities  which could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known 
specifically  we are currently in the midst of examinations by the canadian  german  czech republic and french taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which would affect our financial results
