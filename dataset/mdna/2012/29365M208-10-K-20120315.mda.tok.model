overview we are a development stage medical device company with approvals to commercially launch our product in australia and the european economic area 
we are focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  metabolic diseases and other gastrointestinal disorders 
our proprietary neuroblocking technology  which we refer to as vbloc therapy  is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve using high frequency  low energy  electrical impulses 
we have a limited operating history and currently  we only have regulatory approval to sell our product in australia and the european economic area and do not have any other source of revenue 
our initial product is the maestro system  which uses vbloc therapy to affect metabolic regulatory control  limit the expansion of the stomach  help control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness 
we were formerly known as beta medical  inc and were incorporated in minnesota on december  we later reincorporated in delaware on july  since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our maestro system 
based on our understanding of vagal nerve function and nerve blocking from our preclinical studies and the results of our clinical trials  we believe the maestro system may offer obese patients a minimally invasive treatment that has the potential to result in significant and sustained weight loss 
we believe that our maestro system will allow bariatric surgeons to help obese patients who are concerned about the risks and complications associated with gastric banding and gastric bypass surgery 
in addition  data from our vbloc dm enable trial outside the united states demonstrate that vbloc therapy may hold promise in improving obesity related co morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension 
we are conducting  or plan to conduct  further studies in each of these co morbidities to assess vbloc therapy s potential in addressing multiple indications 
we continue to evaluate the maestro system in human clinical trials in the united states  australia  mexico  norway and switzerland 
to date  we have not observed any mortality related to our device or any unanticipated adverse device effects in these clinical trials 
we have also not observed any long term problematic clinical side effects in any patients  including in those patients who have been using the maestro system for more than one year 
in october  we received an unconditional investigational device exemption ide supplement approval from the us food and drug administration fda to conduct a randomized  double blind  parallel group  multicenter pivotal clinical trial  called the recharge trial  testing the effectiveness and safety of vbloc therapy utilizing our second generation maestro rechargeable rc system 
enrollment and implantation in the recharge trial was completed in december in patients at centers 
all patients in the study received an implanted device and were randomized in a allocation to treatment or control groups 
the control group received a non functional device during the study period 
all patients are expected to participate in a weight management counseling program 
the primary endpoints of efficacy and safety will be evaluated at months  or around december assuming we achieve favorable results  we plan to use data from the trial to support a premarket approval pma application for the maestro rechargeable system 
if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system in the united states in if and when we obtain fda approval of our maestro rechargeable system we intend to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by field technical and marketing managers who provide training  technical and other support services to our customers 
outside the united states we intend to use direct  
table of contents dealer and distributor sales models as the targeted geography best dictates 
to date  we have relied on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our maestro system 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the maestro system 
we obtained european ce mark approval for our maestro rechargeable system in march in january  the final maestro rechargeable system components were listed on the australian register of therapeutic goods artg by the therapeutic goods administration tga 
we have been working closely with our australian distributor  device technologies australia pty limited  to bring the maestro rechargeable system to the australian market through a controlled commercial launch in and expect our first commercial sales to occur during the first half of we also continue to explore additional select international markets to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system  including europe and the middle east 
the method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device  but for our maestro system which is considered an active implantable medical device aimd in australia and the european economic area  and falls into class iii within the united states  the method involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device  and a third party assessment by a notified body  usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer s quality system 
we use dekra certification bv formerly known as kema quality in the netherlands as the notified body for our ce marking approval process 
to date  we have generated no revenue from the sale of products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
although we recently received artg listings to sell our maestro rechargeable system in australia and european ce mark to sell our maestro rechargeable system in the european economic area and expect to commence commercial sales in the first half of  we expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses prior to recording sufficient revenue to offset these expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to add the infrastructure necessary to support our initial commercial sales  operate as a public company and develop our intellectual property portfolio 
for these reasons  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
inventory since inception  inventory related purchases have been used for research and development related activities and have accordingly been expensed as incurred 
in december  we began receiving artg listings for components of the maestro rechargeable system from the australian tga  with the final components being listed on the artg in january as a result  we determined certain assets were recoverable as inventory beginning in december and recorded a current inventory balance of approximately million as of december  we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market and record any long term inventory as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method and recognizing the expense over the option vesting period 
the intrinsic value method is calculated as the difference  if any  between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price on the date of the grant 
we also followed the minimum value disclosure provisions 
using the intrinsic value method  we were not required to recognize stock based compensation expense for employee stock options granted from inception through as the exercise prices  for financial reporting purposes  were determined to be at or above the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our common stock was assessed and approved by our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are nonemployee directors 
in determining the appropriateness of the fair value of our common stock  the board of directors considered several factors  such as our life cycle  results of research and development  recent financings and financial projections 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based payments  which superseded the previous accounting method  and requires compensation expense to be recognized using a fair value based method for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
companies are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we adopted the new provisions using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december  all option grants valued after january  are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes pricing model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the application of share based payment principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
the fair value method is applied to all share based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate  nonemployees  unless another source of literature applies 
when determining the measurement date of a nonemployee s share based payment award  the company measures the stock options at fair value and remeasures such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant and each subsequent reporting period until the services are completed or a significant disincentive for nonperformance occurs  we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
common stock warrant liability effective january   we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance regarding the financial reporting for outstanding equity linked financial instruments 
this adoption required certain warrants issued by us to be recorded as a liability and recorded at fair value 
calculating the fair value of the warrant liability requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which requires our best estimates  and involves inherent 
table of contents uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
the common stock warrant liability and related changes in fair value are significant to our consolidated financial statements and is based on a weighted average black scholes valuation model  however the warrant liability will never result in the payment of cash by us 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million are available for utilization after the application of section limitations  discussed below 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code imposes restrictions on the utilization of various carryforward tax attributes in the event of a change in ownership of the company  as defined by irc section in addition  irc section may limit the company s built in items of deduction  including capitalized start up costs and research and development costs 
during  we completed an irc section review and the results of this review indicate ownership changes have occurred which would cause a limitation on the utilization of carryforward attributes 
the company s gross net operating loss carryforwards  start up costs and research and development credits are all subject to limitation 
under these tax provisions  the limitation is applied first to any built in losses  then to any net operating losses and then to any general business credits 
the section limitation and accompanying recognized built in loss limitation is currently estimated to result in the expiration of million of our gross federal net operating loss carryforward  as well as a write off of million of capitalized start up costs  million of capitalized research and development costs  million of property and equipment and million of research and development credits 
a valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the potential benefits of the remaining carryforwards and tax credits in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
financial overview revenue to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any revenue 
we have received the european ce mark for our maestro rechargeable system  which enables the eventual commercialization in the european economic area 
in january  the final maestro rechargeable system components were listed on the artg by the australian tga and we have been working closely with our australian distributor to bring the maestro rechargeable system to the australian market through a controlled commercial launch in we also continue to explore additional select international markets to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system 
in the united states  we completed enrollment and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in december the primary endpoints of efficacy and safety will be evaluated at months  or around december assuming we achieve favorable results  we plan to use data from that trial to pursue a pma from the fda to allow us to commence sales in the united states 
if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system in the united states in any revenue from initial sales of a new product in the united states or internationally is difficult to predict and in any event will only modestly reduce our continued losses resulting from our research and development and other activities 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering  product development and clinical and regulatory expenses  incurred in the development of our maestro system 
research and development expenses also include employee compensation  including stock based compensation  consulting services  outside services  materials and supplies  including those related to our various clinical trials  depreciation and travel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
from inception through december   we have incurred a total of million in research and development expenses 
with the completion of enrollment and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in late  we expect research and 
table of contents development expenditures to decrease in as we turn our primary focus to supporting this new clinical trial in addition to the continued follow up on existing trials  such as vbloc dm enable and empower 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  market development and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include costs associated with attending medical conferences  professional fees for legal  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain broad protection for the intellectual property related to our products  and accounting services  cash management fees  consulting fees and travel expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in as we begin a controlled commercial launch in australia and possibly other select international markets 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increases of million   and  in professional services  device costs and travel  respectively 
the increases are primarily due to efforts in support of the recharge trial  including patient recruiting and the completion of enrollment and implantation in patients during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is primarily due to increases of   and  in employee stock based compensation  professional services and compensation and benefits expense  respectively 
the increase in employee stock based compensation is primarily the result of granting million stock options during with a weighted average fair value of per share 
the increase in professional services and compensation and benefits was due to commercialization efforts in australia and additional select international markets 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was the result of a decrease in the gross principal balance outstanding from approximately million on december  to approximately million on december  and a modification to the loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb that reduced our annual interest rate from to effective march  change in value of warrant liability 
there was no warrant liability during the year ended december  the value of the warrant liability decreased  for the year ended december  in the warrant liability consisted of warrants issued to compass horizon funding company llc horizon 
the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of may   the date on which the warrants down round protection expired 
the fair market value for these remaining warrants was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a decrease of  for the year ended december  as our stock price decreased from on december  to on may  comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to decreases of million  million   and  in professional services  compensation and benefits expense  device costs and travel  respectively 
the ongoing financial commitment to maintain the empower trial continues to decrease as prescribed patient follow up 
table of contents visits become further apart  which has led to decreases in both professional services and device costs 
the reduction in compensation and benefits expenses along with the reduction in travel expense is primarily the result of a reduction in force completed october  research and development expenses further decreased for the year ended december  as a result of applying for and receiving a  government grant under the therapeutic discovery project credit program  which was a program established by the healthcare reform law enacted march  the program allowed applicants the opportunity to receive a tax credit or a grant for the equivalent amount 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to decreases of  and  in compensation and benefits expense and professional services  respectively 
the decrease in compensation and benefits expense is primarily the result of a reduction in force completed october  the decrease in professional services includes a decrease of  in consulting costs offset by an increase of  in audit and legal fees 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to a focus on capital preservation during while we developed our regulatory strategy and explored financing opportunities 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  was the result of voluntarily prepaying two of the outstanding term loans in full  or approximately of the outstanding principal balance  on december  the prepayment of the term loans resulted in a final payment fee of  and the acceleration of  of unamortized discount on notes payable  both recorded as interest expense in change in value of warrant liability 
the value of the warrant liability decreased  for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the warrant liability consisted of warrants issued to svb  western technology investment wti and horizon 
both svb and wti exercised their warrants in full in september and october  respectively 
as a result  only warrants issued to horizon remained outstanding during the year ended december  the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of may   the date on which the warrants down round protection expired and the warrant liability was reclassified to equity 
the fair market value for these remaining warrants was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a  decrease for the year ended december  as our stock price decreased from on december  to on may  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in december and  as of december  we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
through december   we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock  including million from our initial public offering in november and million from a public offering  private placements and registered direct offerings in and in addition  through december   we had received million in debt financing   to finance equipment purchases and million to finance working capital 
on september   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  in a public offering at an aggregate price of per share and corresponding warrant 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses 

table of contents as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
of this amount million was invested in money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency and  was invested in restricted cash collateral money market accounts as required by the terms of our lease agreement 
these money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at per share  however  it is possible to lose money investing in these funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
at times  such deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments balance as of december   together with any interest income we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into  assuming our planned commercialization and we do not receive any other additional funds 
as of december   we had repaid the outstanding principal amount due to venture lending leasing v  inc a private equity fund under the management of wti and horizon pursuant to the loan and security agreement  effective as of november  the loan agreement 
the remaining unpaid balance of million in debt financing as of december  owed to svb pursuant to the loan agreement is collateralized by a first security priority lien on all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
we have entered into account control agreements in order to perfect the lender s first security interest in our cash and investment accounts 
on february  we entered into a first amendment the amendment with svb to the loan agreement 
the amendment provided that svb s term loan shall be repaid with a payment of  on february  followed by consecutive equal monthly payments of  each  commencing on march  and ending on december  it also amended the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of  payable monthly 
pursuant to the amendment  the conditions pursuant to which the excluded collateral as defined in the loan agreement will be deemed to be included as collateral as defined in the loan agreement were changed from the failure to have five months of remaining liquidity to the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the loan agreement after the date of the amendment or the lender s awareness after such date of an event of default that occurred on or before such date with written notice of such event delivered to the company 
in addition  the amendment revised the financial covenants in the loan agreement to delete the covenant relating to five months of remaining liquidity and to change the liquidity ratio covenant to equal a ratio of i the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with svb and svb s affiliates  divided by ii the outstanding principal amount of the term loan  which is not permitted to be less than 
finally  the amendment added a new covenant  the breach of which would constitute an event of default 
the new covenant required that we receive aggregate net proceeds of at least million from new capital transactions after january  and before march  and to keep the proceeds of such transactions at svb until used 
we satisfied this new covenant with the closing  on january   of our sale of  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting offering expenses 
on july  we entered into a second amendment the second amendment to the loan agreement with svb 
the second amendment modified the repayment terms of the term loan such that from the date of the second amendment through december   we were only required to make interest only monthly payments on the term loan  thereby reducing our monthly debt payment 
then  beginning on january   the remaining balance due on the term loan would amortize over equal payments of principal and interest  payable monthly 
in addition  the second amendment amended the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of  payable monthly 
the second amendment also revised the terms of the financial covenants related to the liquidity ratio and new capital transactions 
pursuant to the second amendment  the liquidity ratio equals the ratio of i the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held with svb and svb s affiliates plus eligible accounts  divided by ii the outstanding principal amount of the term loan and is not permitted to be less than 
pursuant to the second amendment  we were required to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions as 
table of contents defined in the loan agreement of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through august   million from the date of the second amendment through october   million from the date of the second amendment through january  and million from the date of the second amendment through june  if we met those financing requirements  we would satisfy the covenant  however  if we did not receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of at least million from the date of the second amendment through august   million from the date of the second amendment through october   million from the date of the second amendment through january  and million from the date of the second amendment through june   svb s springing lien on our intellectual property would convert to a full lien on the intellectual property as of the date such proposed capital raise was missed 
we received approximately million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock warrants in a private placement transaction that closed on september   which was less than the amount required by the second amendment and resulted in us entering into a third amendment to the loan agreement the third amendment with svb on november  see details of the third amendment below 
finally  the second amendment revised the definition of make whole premium so that only term loan payments of principal made after the date of the second amendment would be counted for purposes of determining whether we have made twelve regularly scheduled monthly payments of principal in accordance with section d of the loan agreement when the make whole premium comes due 
the second amendment also required the issuance of a new warrant to svb with an exercise price per share equal to the volume weighted average closing price of our publicly traded common stock for the five trading days prior to the date of the second amendment 
the warrant gives svb the right to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to  divided by the exercise price per share 
on july   svb was issued a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
as noted above  we entered into a third amendment to the loan agreement with svb on november  the third amendment modified the new capital transaction covenant such that it waived the requirements to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through august  and million from the date of the second amendment through october  the third amendment also modified the requirement to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through january  to million and eliminated the requirement to receive aggregate net proceeds from new capital transactions of not less than million from the date of the second amendment through june  we satisfied this new covenant with the closing  on december   of our sale of  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  in a public offering for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting offering expenses 
lastly  the third amendment suspended the liquidity ratio covenant  which was not permitted to be less than  until january  we agreed to maintain a blocked cash collateral account with funds equal to the principal balance outstanding until such time that certain conditions were met as defined by the third amendment 
there were no changes to the repayment terms of the term loan as defined in the second amendment 
on march  we entered into a fourth amendment the fourth amendment to the loan agreement with svb 
the fourth amendment modified the repayment terms of the term loan such that beginning april  through september   we were only required to make interest only monthly payments on the term loan 
then  beginning on october   the remaining balance due on the term loan started to amortize over equal payments of principal and interest  payable monthly 
in addition  the fourth amendment amended the interest rate due effective march  on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of if the liquidity ratio is greater than and no event of default as defined in the loan agreement has occurred or is continuing or if the liquidity ratio is less than or an event of default has occurred or is continuing  payable monthly 
the fourth amendment also reinstated the financial covenant related to the liquidity ratio  which is not permitted to be less than  and adds an ebitda test should the liquidity ratio fall below 
in addition  the fourth amendment amended the prepayment terms of the loan agreement such that a make whole premium equal to of the amount of the 
table of contents term loan being prepaid will be due for any voluntary or required prepayment of the term loan occurring before the first anniversary of the fourth amendment  unless the term loan is being voluntary prepaid and replaced with a new svb facility 
lastly  the fourth amendment eliminated svb s springing lien on our intellectual property  the new capital transactions requirement and the requirement of the third amendment to maintain a blocked cash collateral account with funds equal to the principal balance outstanding 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  which was partially offset by stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  change in the carrying value of warrant liability  loss on sale of equipment and changes in operating assets and liabilities  including inventory which was recorded as an asset beginning in as we began receiving artg listings for components of the maestro rechargeable system from the australian tga in december net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  is primarily related to a million decrease in the restricted cash balance as a result of the fourth amendment to the loan agreement with svb and million in maturities of short term investments available for sale offset by the purchase of million in short term investments available for sale and  in property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  is primarily related to an increase in restricted cash of million per the terms of our debt and lease agreements 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to proceeds from the maturity of short term investments available for sale partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the completion of a public offering that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants  offset by million in financing costs and the repayment of  on our long term debt 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the completion of a public offering that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants  offset by million in financing costs  a private placement transaction that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of preferred stock and common stock warrants  offset by  in financing costs and a registered direct offering that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock  offset by  in financing costs  partially offset by repayments on our long term debt 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the completion of a private placement transaction that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock and common stock warrants  offset by  in financing costs  the completion of a registered direct offering that resulted in gross proceeds of million for the issuance of common stock  offset by  in financing costs and debt funding proceeds of million automatically funded on april  per the terms of the million debt facility we entered into on november   partially offset by repayments on our long term debt 

table of contents operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any operating revenues 
we obtained european ce mark approval for our maestro rechargeable system in march in january  the final maestro rechargeable system components were listed on the artg by the australian tga 
we have been working closely with our australian distributor  device technologies australia pty limited  to bring the maestro rechargeable system to the australian market through a controlled commercial launch in and expect our first commercial sales to occur during the first half of we also continue to explore additional select international markets to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system 
in the united states  we completed enrollment and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in december the primary endpoints of efficacy and safety will be evaluated at months  or around december assuming we achieve favorable results  we plan to use data from that trial to pursue a pma from the fda to allow us to commence sales in the united states 
if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system in the united states in we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we develop our products  prepare for the potential commercial launch of our maestro rechargeable system  develop the corporate infrastructure required to sell our products  operate as a publicly traded company and pursue additional applications for our technology platform 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments balance of million as of december   and any interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into  assuming our planned commercialization and we do not receive any other additional funds 
if our available cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investment balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our maestro system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of any recalls or other field actions required either by us or by regulatory bodies in those countries in which we market our products  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our maestro system and any products that we may develop

on march  we entered into a fourth amendment the fourth amendment to the loan agreement with svb  which modified the repayment terms of the term loan such that beginning april  through september   we were only required to make interest only monthly payments on the term loan  thereby reducing our monthly debt payment 
then  beginning on october   the remaining balance due on the term loan started to amortize over equal payments of principal and interest  payable monthly 
in addition  the fourth amendment amended the interest rate due on the remaining principal amount of the term loan from to a fixed annual rate of if the liquidity ratio is greater than and no event of default as defined in the loan agreement has occurred or is continuing or if the liquidity ratio is less than or an event of default has occurred or is continuing  payable monthly 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of the fourth amendment 
off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities as defined by rules enacted by the sec and financial accounting standards board fasb  and accordingly  no such arrangements are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and international financial reporting standards 
this new guidance amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization 
this new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a material impact on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the new guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there have been no other significant changes in recent accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we may maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio  if any  are not leveraged  are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
