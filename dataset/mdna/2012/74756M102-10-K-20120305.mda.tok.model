index to financial statements our industries chemical logistics formerly logistics the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists mainly of liquid and dry bulk chemicals including plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we estimate  based on industry sources  that the highly fragmented north american for hire segment of the bulk transport market generated revenues of approximately billion in we specifically operate in the for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market which we estimated at billion in 
we believe we have the leading market share estimated at in in this sector based on revenues 
through our independent affiliate network  we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network in north america comprising terminals  tractors and trailers 
we believe managing a larger carrier network facilitates customer service and lane density  and provides a more favorable cost structure for us and our independent affiliates 
as such  we believe we are well positioned to expand our business by increasing our market share 
the chemical bulk tank truck industry growth is generally dependent on volume growth in the industrial chemical industry  the rate at which chemical companies outsource their transportation needs  the overall capacity of the rail system  and  in particular  the extent to which chemical companies make use of the rail system for their bulk chemical transportation needs 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth in our core business are the ability to obtain additional business from existing customers  add new customers  increase the utilization of our trailer fleet and add and retain qualified drivers 
the chemical bulk tank industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as the time and cost required to develop the operational infrastructure necessary to handle sensitive chemical cargo  the financial and managerial resources required to recruit and train drivers  substantial and increasingly more stringent industry regulatory requirements  strong customer relationships and the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment and establish a network of terminals and independent affiliates 
energy logistics in  we initiated a growth strategy targeting the gas and oil frac shale energy market through our wholly owned subsidiaries  qcer 
we currently serve several customers and operate approximately units of energy equipment in this market 
in our third quarter of  qcer won a multi year contract with a major energy company to provide full logistics of their fresh and disposal water hauling needs in the marcellus shale region of pennsylvania 
the logistics revenues associated with this contract began in the third quarter of and are expected to provide significant revenue and growth prospects for the future 
in our fourth quarter of  we began hauling oil in the eagle ford shale region of texas which we expect to provide revenue and growth prospects for the future as well 
we believe the energy market has significant revenue potential and we may realize higher margins and better equipment utilization than we experience in our chemical logistics business 
in connection with our entry into this business  due to its attractive return profile  we may operate a portion of the business through company operated terminals  rather than through independent affiliates  which could affect the overall mix of our asset light business 
intermodal we estimate that the north american intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services market generated revenues of approximately million in  and we believe boasso including greensville has the leading market share 
the intermodal iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the proliferation of global import export of bulk liquid chemicals has driven the movement of basic manufacturing out of the united states and has resulted in an increase in chemical plant infrastructure to service 
table of contents 
index to financial statements these off shore industries 
driven by this globalization  the intermodal iso tank container market is a growing sector of the overall liquid bulk chemical transportation sector 
furthermore  chemical manufacturers have sought to efficiently transport their products by utilizing iso tank containers 
the resulting demand for distributors that can offer a broad range of services within the supply chain will drive future growth in this sector 
we believe that our intermodal business will benefit from these trends because of its market leadership  experience and track record 
competition the tank truck business is competitive and fragmented 
in our chemical logistics segment  we compete primarily with other tank truck carriers and dedicated private fleets in various states within the united states and canada 
competition from for hire carriers is composed of fewer than ten large carriers  most of which have other businesses that do not compete with ours  and more than smaller  primarily regional carriers 
with respect to certain aspects of our business  we also compete with intermodal transportation and railroads 
intermodal transportation has increased in recent years 
competition for the bulk tank truck services is based primarily on rates and service 
we believe that we enjoy significant competitive advantages over other tank truck carriers because of our market share  overall fleet size  variable cost structure  strength of our independent affiliates and our national terminal network 
our intermodal business competes primarily with other national  regional and local tank truck carriers and dedicated private fleets as well as local and regional dry container transporters 
competition in our intermodal iso tank container services business depends on which competitors have facilities that are proximate to the ports serviced by boasso 
among competitors for a port location  competition is based primarily on rates and service 
our competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to sustain our market leadership and continue to grow our business largest tank truck network in a fragmented industry we operate the largest tank truck network in north america with a share of the highly fragmented billion for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market  in each case estimated by us based on figures contained in bulk transporter s tank truck carrier annual gross revenue report 
we believe our unique large nationwide network covers all major north american chemical shippers and enables us to serve customers with both international and national requirements better than our competitors  the majority of which are regionally focused 
our size allows us  our independent affiliates and our independent owner operators to benefit from economies of scale in the purchasing of supplies and services  including fuel  tires and insurance coverage 
additionally  we believe the breadth of our network provides us with a competitive advantage as we continue to pursue the gas and oil frac shale energy market  which is currently primarily served by numerous small carriers 
asset light business model our extensive use of independent affiliates and independent owner operators results in a highly variable cost structure with relatively minimal net capital investment requirements 
we generally expect sustaining capital expenditures for our chemical logistics and intermodal businesses  net of proceeds from property and equipment sales  to be approximately of operating revenues annually  compared to the industry average of more than for truckload carrier companies 
this model also contributes to the stability of our cash flow and margins and increases our return on invested capital 
the independent affiliates are responsible for capital investments and most of the operating expenses related to the business they service  including the capital costs related to purchasing and maintaining tractors 
typically  independent affiliates purchase or lease tractors for their business directly from the manufacturers and lease trailers from us 
independent owner operators are independent 
table of contents 
index to financial statements contractors who supply one or more tractors and drivers for our own or our independent affiliates use 
as with independent affiliates  independent owner operators are responsible for most of the operating expenses related to the business they service  including costs related to the acquisition and maintenance of tractors 
with our entry into the energy markets  we expect our capital expenditure outlays for our energy logistics business to rise as we organically build our equipment and other resources for this business 
we prefer to own trailers as they provide us with a stable source of lease income  as well as access to attractive capital through our asset based loan facility the new abl facility 
through proper maintenance  we are typically able to extend the useful lives of trailers used in our chemical logistics business beyond the expected year life  leading to operational flexibility and lower maintenance capital expenditure requirements 
core carrier to blue chip chemical companies we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with north american operations  including many fortune companies and other major companies engaged in chemical processing 
our key customers include arclin  arkema  ashland  basf  dow  dupont  exxonmobil  georgia pacific  honeywell  ppg industries  procter gamble  sunoco and uniliver 
in  and  our top customers in our chemical logistics business accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our chemical logistics revenue 
no single customer accounted for more than of our chemical logistics revenue in our ability to maintain these business relationships reflects our service performance and commitment to safety and reliability 
we have established long term customer relationships with these clients  which help us attract and retain experienced independent affiliate terminal operators and drivers 
our team of national account vice presidents and directors have decades of experience in our industry  which we believe enables them to provide practical solutions to complex customer issues 
exposure to high growth international markets through our intermodal business  we have significant exposure to high growth international markets 
boasso and greensville  collectively are the leading providers of intermodal iso tank container over the road transportation and depot services in north america 
the intermodal tank container transportation market has experienced significant growth recently as international chemical trade has increased and chemical manufacturers move towards greater utilization of intermodal tanks and standardized intermodal tank containers to efficiently transport their products around the world via sea  land and air 
our intermodal tank container depots  which provide transportation  cleaning  heating  testing  maintenance and storage services  are located at or near ports in new orleans  la  houston  tx  newark  nj  charleston  sc  chicago  il  detroit  mi  savannah  ga  jacksonville  fl  and norfolk  va 
since we acquired boasso in  their revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
greensville was acquired in november diverse product end markets we serve customers in a number of different industries  whose products reach a diverse group of end markets 
many of our customers major end markets  such as refining and water treatment  energy  ink and agriculture typically have volumes that we believe are not highly correlated with economic cycles 
in addition  our recent affiliate additions in the energy market have expanded our presence into the natural gas and oil industries 
we believe the diversity of our customer base  geography and end markets provides a competitive advantage 
stable pricing environment we believe pricing in the bulk tank truck industry tends to be more stable than pricing in the overall trucking industry 
we believe the specialized nature of the bulk tank truck industry  including specifically licensed drivers  specialized equipment and more stringent safety requirements  create barriers to entry which 
table of contents 
index to financial statements limit the more drastic swings in supply experienced by the broader trucking industry 
additionally  it is common practice in the bulk tank truck industry for customers to pay fuel surcharges  which enables trucking companies to recover fuel price increases from customers 
safe and efficient operations we have a strong emphasis on safety in our operations and have a relentless focus on improving productivity and efficiency 
since  we have reduced our department of transportation dot accident rating from to  which is below the national average of in this proactive approach to safety has resulted in financial benefits by enabling us to reduce our insurance deductibles from million to million and obtain letter of credit reductions of million in the past few years 
in addition  our insurance costs have decreased from million in to million in given the nature of the cargo we haul  which requires a high degree of careful handling  we believe that our strong focus on safety creates a competitive advantage for us 
we believe we are well positioned to comply with the recent implementation of the federal motor carrier safety administration s the fmcsa comprehensive safety analysis csa program  which imposes additional safety standards on the industry 
for example  we completed the installation of electronic on board recorders eobrs in substantially all of our us chemical logistics fleet in even though this is not currently required by regulation 
strong management team with a track record of success our management team  led by our chief executive officer  gary enzor  successfully navigated our business through the economic slowdown by implementing cost savings measures and by leading the transition to an affiliate based network  among other initiatives 
as a result  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from an economic recovery 
mr 
enzor  as well as our president and chief operating officer  steve attwood  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  joe troy  and other senior managers have significant managerial  operational and financial experience and have implemented various operational initiatives to improve productivity 
our management team has demonstrated its ability to acquire and integrate assets  as well as divest non core businesses  as evidenced by the acquisition of boasso in december  the divestiture of the qsi tank wash business in october and the acquisition of greensville in november over the last months  our management team has successfully refinanced our debt  reduced leverage and raised equity capital  leading to a stronger financial position for the company 
our growth strategy building on the competitive strengths mentioned above  we plan to grow our revenue and increase cash flow and profitability as follows pursue attractive growth opportunities penetrate energy market in  we launched an initiative to identify complementary markets to enhance organic growth in our logistics business 
specifically  in the fourth quarter of  we began marketing transportation services to the frac shale natural gas and oil drilling industry 
this addressable market is extensive and growing at a faster rate than our core chemical logistics business 
we seek to build a sizable share as this logistics market is currently served primarily by small under resourced carriers 
in addition to growth potential  expected returns in the energy logistics market are very compelling with higher margins and better equipment utilization than we generally experience in our core chemical logistics business 
in the second quarter of  we began hauling fresh water to drill sites for customers in the marcellus shale region of pennsylvania  and in the third quarter of  we won a multi year contract with a major energy company to provide full logistics of their fresh and disposal water hauling needs in the marcellus shale region 
the logistics revenues associated with this contract began in the third quarter of and are expected to provide significant revenue and growth prospects in the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements future 
in the fourth quarter of  we began hauling oil for a customer in the eagle ford shale region of texas and we are in discussions with other energy companies in the eagle ford region and bakken shale region of north dakota 
we are optimistic that this new market can be a significant contributor to our revenue growth 
grow business with blue chip customers we plan to leverage our strong existing relationships with the major chemical shippers to increase our market share of these customers volumes 
for example  in the past few years  due to our strong commitment to customer service  we have been the sole source provider for one major chemical shipper and have grown revenue from million in to million in in addition  we increased our revenue with another major chemical distributor from million in to million in by leveraging our national network  solutions approach and customer service 
through our dedicated sales force  we maintain an active and robust pipeline of potential opportunities to grow our business 
we believe our business model allows our existing infrastructure to absorb significant additional volume without the need for major capital expenditures in our chemical logistics business 
expand through acquisitions and new independent affiliations we have strong organizational competence which we believe will allow us to identify and evaluate potential opportunities to acquire assets and businesses and increase our independent affiliate network 
we believe we can make selective  highly accretive add on acquisitions on an opportunistic basis to supplement our existing core business 
for example  in  we acquired boasso  the largest north american provider of iso intermodal tank container transportation and depot services 
in november  we acquired greensville  a leading provider of iso intermodal tank container transportation and depot services with access to ports in virginia  maryland and south carolina 
in addition to acquiring companies  we are able to grow externally by bringing new independent affiliates into our network 
we believe that the various services we provide to our independent affiliates  including working capital  back office and sales support  technology support  insurance and cash flow management and regulatory compliance oversight  make our platform attractive for our independent affiliates 
for example  in  we added a dry bulk carrier primarily servicing the east coast markets  to our affiliate network and in the fourth quarter of  we added a new carrier to haul oil in the eagle ford shale region 
we continually evaluate potential future acquisitions  some of which may be material 
enhance independent affiliate trucking operations we have focused over the last three years and continue to focus on a less capital intensive business model based on our independent affiliates 
we believe this business model reduces certain fixed costs and provide a more flexible  variable cost structure for us 
in and  we transitioned the majority of our company operated chemical logistics terminals to independent affiliates 
we also moved one third of our sales representatives to the independent affiliates to better cover key regional accounts 
as a result of these actions and the sale of our tank wash business in  we generated approximately  and of our chemical logistics transportation revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively  from independent affiliates 
we believe that the greater proportion of operating revenue derived from independent affiliate operations in and is likely to be indicative of the proportion of operating revenue derived from independent affiliate operations in the future 
at the same time  due to our ownership of the customer contracts and relationships  presence of non compete agreements with the independent affiliates  and our ownership of the trailers  our relationships with the independent affiliates tend to be long term in nature  with minimal turnover 
we also monitor volume performance of each independent affiliate on a regular basis to ensure operating performance is in line with management s expectations 
we work proactively with our affiliates to take corrective action or render assistance where appropriate and have certain contractual mechanisms in place to remedy sustained underperformance 
we believe our selected independent affiliates are also generally well financed and have the capacity to increase their revenue base while maintaining a high level of customer service 

table of contents 
index to financial statements focus on driver recruitment and retention we are committed to being a driver focused company that provides both technical support and personal respect to these professionals 
we believe we offer competitive compensation at a premium compared to most commercial driving opportunities 
with an average haul length of miles  our drivers are also generally home more frequently 
our driver organization contains field based recruiters who augment the friendly  small business environment provided by our business model 
in  we implemented eobrs within our us chemical logistics network fleet prior to regulatory requirements to which we believe all major carriers will be subject in the future 
while this initiative has temporarily increased driver turnover and adversely impacted our revenue during  we believe that as the overall economy improves  our historical ability to attract qualified drivers could prove to be a significant competitive advantage to us 
increase trailer utilization at december   we owned or leased approximately  trailers  the majority of which we lease or sublease to independent affiliates 
trailer leasing is a key component of our business model 
through proper maintenance  we are typically able to extend the useful lives of trailers beyond the expected year life  leading to operational flexibility and lower maintenance capital expenditure requirements 
our independent affiliates have significant contractual limitations on their ability to lease or purchase trailers from sources other than us  helping to ensure their continued utilization 
based on our current trailer fleet  we believe we have the ability to continue to capture additional chemical logistics business volume with minimal capital expenditures 
to increase our trailer utilization  we also actively pursue opportunities to lease our trailers to third parties other than our independent affiliates 
the operating leverage inherent in our business model allows a significant portion of any incremental revenue generated through increased trailer utilization to flow through to our operating income 
independent owner operators we and our independent affiliates extensively utilize independent owner operators 
independent owner operators are independent contractors who  through contracts with our operating subsidiaries  supply one or more tractors and drivers for our subsidiaries or independent affiliate use 
independent owner operators contracts generally are terminable by either party upon short notice 
in exchange for the services rendered  independent owner operators are normally paid a fixed percentage of the revenues collected on each load hauled or on a per mile rate 
the percentage of revenues paid to independent owner operators by us is lower than the percentage paid to affiliates 
independent owner operators pay all tractor operating expenses such as fuel  physical damage insurance  tractor maintenance  fuel taxes and highway use taxes 
however  we reimburse independent owner operators for certain expenses passed through to our customers  such as tolls and scaling charges 
we operate programs intended to benefit independent owner operators by reducing their operating expenses such as tractors  fuel  tires  occupational accident insurance and physical damage insurance 
we compete with other motor carriers for the services of our drivers and independent owner operators 
our overall size and our reputation for good relations have enabled us to attract qualified professional drivers and independent owner operators 
employees and independent owner operators at december   we utilized  drivers of which  were utilized in our chemical logistics segment  were utilized in our energy logistics segment and were utilized in our intermodal segment 
of this total   were independent owner operators   were independent affiliate drivers  and were company employee drivers 
our energy logistics business also utilizes other third party carriers

union labor at december   we had employees and our independent affiliates had employees who were members of the international brotherhood of teamsters 
all employees are utilized in our chemical logistics segment 
tractors and trailers as of december   we managed a fleet of approximately  tractors and  trailers utilized by either us  our independent affiliates  independent owner operators  or shippers 
the majority of our trailers are single compartment  chemical hauling trailers 
the balance of the fleet is made up of multi compartment trailers  dry bulk trailers  and special use energy equipment 
the chemical transport units typically have a capacity between  and  gallons and are designed to meet dot specifications for transporting hazardous materials 
each trailer is designed for a useful service life of to years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications 
each tractor is designed for a useful life of five to seven years  though this can be extended through upgrades and modifications

technology we rely heavily on information technology and communications systems to operate our business and manage our network in an efficient manner 
in contrast to many of our smaller competitors  we have equipped our drivers with various mobile communications systems that enable us to monitor our tractors and communicate with our drivers in the field and enable customers to track the location and monitor the progress of their cargo through the internet 
during  we implemented eobrs within our us chemical logistics network 
risk management  insurance and safety the primary insurable risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation and cargo loss and damage which includes spills and chemical releases 
we maintain insurance against these risks and are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of the deductible under each policy 
we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage with an aggregate limit on the coverage in the amount of million  with a million per incident deductible 
we currently maintain a million per incident deductible for workers compensation insurance coverage 
we are insured over our deductible up to the statutory requirement by state and we are self insured for damage or loss to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
we employ personnel to perform compliance checks and conduct safety tests throughout our operations 
a number of safety programs are conducted that are designed to promote compliance with rules and regulations and to reduce accidents and cargo claims 
these programs include training programs  driver recognition programs  safety awards  driver safety meetings  distribution of safety bulletins to drivers and participation in national safety associations 
environmental matters it is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental  safety  and health laws 
we also are committed to the principles of responsible care  an international chemical industry initiative to enhance the industry s responsible management of chemicals 
we have obtained independent certification that our management system is in place and functions according to professional standards and we continue to evaluate and continuously improve our responsible care management system performance 
our activities involve the handling  transportation and storage of bulk chemicals  both liquid and dry  many of which are classified as hazardous materials or hazardous substances 
historically  our operations involved the generation  storage  discharge and disposal of wastes that may contain hazardous substances  the inventory and use of cleaning materials that may contain hazardous substances and the control and discharge of storm water from industrial sites 
in addition  we may store diesel fuel  materials containing oil and other hazardous products at our terminals 
as such  we and others who operate in our industry are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by us federal  state and local agencies as well as foreign governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  and address emissions to the air  discharge onto land or water  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
these laws change frequently and generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time  and most provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
under certain of these laws  we could also be subject to allegations of liability for the activities of our independent affiliates or independent owner operators 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other releases of such substances 
from time to time  we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties with respect to chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities and on the road  and  notwithstanding the existence of our environmental management program  we cannot assure that such obligations will not be incurred in the future  predict with certainty the extent of future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws  or assure that such liabilities will not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
we have established reserves for remediation expenses at known contamination sites when it is probable that such efforts will be required of us and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
we have also incurred in the past  and expect to incur in the future  capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance for current and planned operations 
such expenditures are generally included in our overall capital and operating budgets and are not accounted for separately 
however  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws in conducting current and planned operations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
reserves our policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of costs for future environmental compliance and remediation may be impacted by such factors as changes in environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of currently unknown potential remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties under the applicable statutes 
our reserves for environmental compliance and remediation are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
as of december  and  we had reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively  for all environmental matters  of which the most significant are discussed below 
the balances presented include both current and long term environmental reserves 
we expect the estimated environmental obligations to be paid over the next five years 
additions to the environmental liability reserves are classified in our consolidated statements of operations within the selling and administrative category 
property contamination liabilities we have been named as or are alleged to be a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and similar state laws at approximately sites 
at of the sites  we are one of many parties with alleged liability and are negotiating with federal  state or private parties on the scope of our obligations  if any 
at of the sites  we will be participating in the initial study to determine site remediation objectives 
since our overall liability cannot be estimated at this time  we have set reserves for only the initial remedial investigation phase 
at of the sites  we have explicitly denied any liability and since there has been no subsequent demand for payment we have not established a reserve for these matters 
we have estimated all future expenditures for these multi party environmental matters to be paid over the next five years to be in the range of million to million 
at of the sites  we are the only responsible party and are in the process of conducting investigations and or remediation projects 
five of these projects relate to operations conducted by our subsidiary  clc  and its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of clc in these five sites are bridgeport  new jersey  william dick  pennsylvania  tonawanda  new york  scary creek  west virginia  and charleston  west virginia 
the remaining three sites relate to investigations and potential remediation that were triggered by the new jersey industrial site recovery act isra  which requires such investigations and remediation following the sale of industrial facilities 
each of these sites is discussed in more detail below 
we have estimated future expenditures over the next five years for these eight properties to be in the range of million to million

the fmcsa enforces comprehensive trucking safety regulations and performs certain functions relating to such matters as motor carrier registration  cargo and liability insurance  extension of credit to motor carrier customers  and leasing of equipment by motor carriers from independent owner operators 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the tank truck industry  including testing and specifications of equipment and product handling requirements 
we may transport most types of freight to and from any point in the united states over any route selected by us 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes  including changes intended to address climate change  that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices  restricting and taxing emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes may include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  increasing control over the transportation of hazardous materials  changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period of time  mandate to utilize eobrs or limits on vehicle weight and size 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the dot

dot regulations mandate drug and alcohol testing of drivers and other safety personnel 
in  we underwent a compliance review by the fmcsa in which we retained our satisfactory dot safety rating 
any downgrade in our dot safety rating as a result of the new csa regulations described below  or otherwise could adversely affect our business 
in december  the fmcsa began to rate individual driver safety performance inclusive of all driver violations over year time periods under new regulations known as the csa 
csa is an fmcsa initiative designed to provide motor carriers and drivers with attention from fmcsa and state partners about their

index to financial statements potential safety problems with an ultimate goal of achieving a greater reduction in large truck and bus crashes  injuries  and fatalities 
prior to these regulations  only carriers were rated by the dot and the rating only included out of service violations and ticketed offenses associated with out of service violations 
under the csa  the fmcsa may deem carriers with poor safety performance unfit to operate  which serves to prohibit the carrier from operating until its safety fitness determination improves 
in august a federal court decision vacated regulations of the fmcsa that would have mandated eobrs for certain carriers with demonstrated non compliance with hours of service regulations 
the fmcsa has announced that it does not intend to appeal the decision and will instead pursue implementation of its rule proposed in february to require eobrs for all interstate carriers currently subject to record keeping requirements for its hours of service regulations 
certain congressional bills would also require eobrs in most interstate tractors if they became law 
title vi of the federal aviation administration authorization act of generally prohibits individual states  political subdivisions thereof and combinations of states from regulating price  entry  routes or service levels of most motor carriers 
however  the states retained the right to continue to require certification of carriers  based upon two primary fitness criteria safety and insurance and retained certain other limited regulatory rights 
prior to january   we held intra state authority in several states 
since that date  we have either been grandfathered or have obtained the necessary certification to continue to operate in those states 
in states in which we were not previously authorized to operate intrastate  we have obtained certificates or permits allowing us to operate 
we are subject to compliance with cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the transportation security administration and by the department of homeland security  including regulation by the bureau of customs and border protection 
we believe that we will be able to comply with bureau of customs and border protection rules  requiring pre notification of cross border shipments  with no material effect on our operations 
we are also subject to the motor carrier laws of canada and mexico 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs and adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted 
during  we began marketing transportation services to the frac shale natural gas and oil drilling industry 
material regulatory regimes specifically designed to regulate this industry are not currently in place 
however  certain congressional bills have been advanced that  if enacted  would subject this industry to governmental regulation 
further  federal and state environmental and other agencies might enact rules under existing statutory authority to govern this industry 
the enactment of legislation regulating the frac shale natural gas and oil drilling industry  or the exercise of rulemaking authority by governmental agencies  could have a material adverse effect on the customers we serve in this industry  and accordingly could adversely affect demand for our energy logistics services  impact the profitability of this business or subject us to additional regulation

risk factors risks related to our business our business is subject to general and industry specific economic factors that are largely out of our control and could affect our operations and profitability 
our business is dependent on various economic factors over which we have little control  that include the availability of qualified drivers  access to the credit and capital markets  changes in regulations concerning shipment and storage of material we transport and depot  increases in fuel prices  taxes and tolls  increases in costs of equipment  interest rate  natural gas  oil and currency fluctuations  excess capacity in the chemical logistics  energy logistics or intermodal industry  changes in license and regulatory fees  potential disruptions at us ports of entry  downturns in customers business cycles  and reductions in customers shipping requirements 
as a result  we may experience periods of overcapacity  declining prices  lower profit margins and less availability of cash in the future 
we have a large number of customers in the chemical processing and consumer goods industries 
if these customers experience fluctuations in their business activity due to an economic downturn  work stoppages or other industry conditions  the volume of freight transported by us or intermodal provided by us on behalf of those customers may decrease 
the volume of shipments of chemical products is  in turn  affected by many other industries and end use markets  including consumer and industrial products  paints and coatings  paper and packaging  agriculture and food products  and tends to vary with changing economic conditions 
the trucking industry  in general  experienced a slowdown due to lower demand resulting from slowing economic conditions in and these conditions continued  although to a lesser extent  in and and it is uncertain whether economic conditions will improve in and beyond 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our new abl facility and the indentures governing our second priority senior secured notes due the notes contain covenants that limit or prohibit our ability  among other things  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares  redeem  repurchase  make payments on or retire subordinated indebtedness or make other restricted payments  make certain loans  acquisitions  capital expenditures or investments  sell certain assets  including stock of our subsidiaries  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create or incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into certain transactions with our independent affiliates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these covenants may prohibit or impair us from taking actions that we believe are best for our business and shareholders 
furthermore  under the new abl facility we may be required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions 
our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not meet those ratios 
in addition  covenants in our debt agreements limit our use of proceeds from our ordinary operations and from extraordinary transactions 
these limits may require us to apply proceeds in a certain manner or prohibit us from utilizing the proceeds in our operations or from prepaying or retiring indebtedness that we desire 
a failure to comply with any of the covenants contained in the new abl facility or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of default  the lenders of the defaulted indebtedness would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us under the new abl facility  could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees  to be due immediately and terminate all commitments to extend further credit  or could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 
such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness 
if we were unable to repay amounts under the new abl facility  the lenders under the new abl facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if any of our indebtedness is accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
we have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to make required payments on our indebtedness 
we had consolidated indebtedness and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  of million as of december  we must make regular payments under the new abl facility and our capital leases and semi annual interest payments under our notes 
our notes issued in the quarter ended december  carry high fixed rates of interest 
in addition  interest on amounts borrowed under our new abl facility is variable and will increase as market rates of interest increase 
we do not presently hedge against the risk of rising interest rates 
our higher interest expense may reduce our future profitability 
our future higher interest expense and future redemption obligations could have other important consequences with respect to our ability to manage our business successfully  including the following it may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations for our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with these obligations could result in an event of default  it will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other business activities  it increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  it limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  it may make us more vulnerable to further downturns in our business or the economy  and it limits our ability to exploit business opportunities 
the new abl facility matures august however  the maturity date of the new abl facility may be accelerated if we default on our obligations 
if the maturity of the new abl facility and or such other debt is accelerated  we do not believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to repay the new abl facility and or such other debt or  unless conditions in the credit markets improve significantly  that we will be able to refinance the new abl facility and or such other debt on acceptable terms  or at all 
the failure to repay or refinance the new abl facility and or such other debt at maturity will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition  would cause substantial liquidity problems and may result in the bankruptcy of us and or our subsidiaries 
any actual or potential bankruptcy or liquidity crisis may materially harm our relationships with our customers  suppliers and independent affiliates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our ability to satisfy our interest and principal payment obligations will depend upon  among other things our future financial and operating performance  which will be affected by many factors beyond our control  and our future ability to borrow under the new abl facility  the availability of which depends on  among other things  our complying with the covenants in the new abl facility 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  and we may not be able to draw under the new abl facility  in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness or fund our operations  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
if we are not able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise capital on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or for sufficient proceeds  we could default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
despite our substantial indebtedness  we may incur significantly more indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the new abl facility and the indentures governing the notes contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
accordingly  we or our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 
we had million available for additional borrowing under the new abl facility as of december   including a subfacility for letters of credit  and the covenants under our debt agreements would allow us to borrow a significant amount of indebtedness beyond this amount 
additional leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and could increase the risks described in our debt agreements contain restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business  and we have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to make required payments on our indebtedness 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
no single carrier in the chemical logistics or energy logistics business has a significant market share 
we compete with many other carriers of varying sizes  customers private fleets  and  to a lesser extent in the chemical logistics market  with railroads  which may limit our growth opportunities and reduce profitability 
historically  competition has created downward pressure on the trucking industry s pricing structure 
some trucking companies with which we compete have greater financial resources than we do 
we believe that the most significant competitive factor that impacts demand for our services is rates  and we may be forced to lower our rates based on our competitors pricing decisions  which would reduce our profitability 
in fact  certain markets that we serve have experienced fierce price competition in recent years 
this has been further magnified through the impact of the recent global economic recession as trucking companies have focused more on price to retain business and market share 
with respect to certain aspects of our business  we also compete with intermodal transportation and railroads 
intermodal transportation has increased in recent years 
growth in such forms of transport could adversely affect our market share  net sales and profit margins 
competition from non trucking modes of transportation and from intermodal transportation would likely increase if state or federal fuel taxes were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation 

table of contents 
index to financial statements additional trends include current and anticipated consolidation among our competitors which may cause us to lose market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing 
some of our competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do 
as a result  those competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within our industry and in the economy as a whole 
if we do not compete successfully  our operating margins  financial condition  cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected 
our reliance upon independent affiliates and independent owner operators could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
we rely heavily upon independent affiliates and independent owner operators to perform the logistics services for which we contract with our customers 
a reduction in the number of independent owner operators  whether due to capital requirements related to the expense of obtaining  operating and maintaining equipment or for other reasons  could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability 
similarly the loss of one or more independent affiliates could adversely affect our profitability 
contracts with independent affiliates are for various terms and contracts with independent owner operators may be terminated by either party on short notice 
although independent affiliates and independent owner operators are responsible for paying for their own equipment and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek a higher percentage of the revenue generated if we are unable to increase our rates commensurately 
a continued decline in the rates we pay to our independent affiliates and independent owner operators could adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing independent affiliates and independent owner operators and attract new independent affiliates  independent owner operators and drivers 
disagreements with independent affiliates or independent owner operators as to payment or other terms  or the failure of a key independent affiliate to meet our contractual obligations or otherwise perform consistent with our requirements may require us to utilize alternative suppliers  in each case at potentially higher prices or with disruption of the services that we provide to our customers 
if we fail to deliver on time or if the costs of our services increase  then our profitability and customer relationships could be harmed 
although our independent affiliates and independent owner operators have substantial contractual obligations to us  we do not control them 
these independent affiliates and independent owner operators typically utilize tractors and trailers bearing our tradenames and trademarks 
to the extent that one of our independent affiliates or independent owner operators are subject to negative publicity  it could reflect on us and have a material adverse effect on our business  brand  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the loss of one or more significant customers may adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon a limited number of large customers 
our top ten customers accounted for of our total revenue during the loss of one or more of our major customers  or a material reduction in services we perform for such customers  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are self insured and have exposure to certain claims and are subject to the insurance marketplace  all of which could affect our profitability 
the primary accident risks associated with our business are motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation claims  environmental pollution liability claims  cargo loss and damage  and general liability claims 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we currently maintain insurance for motor vehicle related bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  independent owner operators and independent affiliates  workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers  environmental pollution liability claims  and general liability claims 
our insurance program includes a self insured deductible of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and a million deductible for workers compensation 
in addition  we currently maintain insurance policies with a total limit of million  of which million is provided under an umbrella liability policy and million is provided under a truckers liability policy 
the million deductible per incident could adversely affect our profitability  particularly in the event of an increase in the number or severity of incidents 
additionally  we are self insured for damage to the equipment that we own and lease  as well as for cargo losses and such self insurance is not subject to any maximum limitation 
we extend insurance coverage to our independent affiliates and independent owner operators for i motor vehicle related bodily injury  ii motor vehicle related property damage  and iii cargo loss and damage 
under this extended coverage  independent affiliates and independent owner operators are responsible for only a small portion of the applicable deductibles 
we are subject to changing conditions and pricing in the insurance marketplace and we cannot assure you that the cost or availability of various types of insurance may not change dramatically in the future 
to the extent these costs cannot be passed on to our customers in increased freight rates  increases in insurance costs could reduce our future profitability and cash flow 
changes in laws and regulations regarding health insurance benefits could adversely affect our cost of operations  employee relations and profitability 
the recently enacted federal healthcare reform legislation could significantly increase our employee costs by requiring us either to provide health insurance coverage to our employees or to pay certain penalties for electing not to provide such coverage 
because these new requirements are broad  complex  subject to certain phase in rules and pending legal challenges  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact that this legislation will have on our business and operating costs 
we cannot assure you that this legislation or any alternative version that may ultimately be implemented will not materially increase our operating costs 
this legislation could also adversely affect our employee relations and ability to compete for new employees if our response to this legislation is considered less favorable than the responses or health benefits offered by employers with whom we compete for talent 
the trucking industry is subject to regulation  and changes in trucking regulations may increase costs 
as a motor carrier  we are subject to regulation by the fmcsa and the dot  and by various federal  state  and provincial agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing various aspects such as operating authority  safety  hours of service  hazardous materials transportation  financial reporting and acquisitions 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment  product handling requirements and drug testing of drivers 
in  we underwent a compliance review by the fmcsa in which we retained our satisfactory dot safety rating 
any downgrade in our dot safety rating as a result of the new csa regulations described below or otherwise could adversely affect our business 
in december  the fmcsa began to rate individual driver safety performance inclusive of all driver violations over year time periods under new regulations known as the csa 
csa is an fmcsa initiative designed to provide motor carriers and drivers with attention from fmcsa and state partners about their 
table of contents 
index to financial statements potential safety problems with an ultimate goal of achieving a greater reduction in large truck and bus crashes  injuries  and fatalities 
prior to these regulations  only carriers were rated by the dot and the rating only included out of service violations and ticketed offenses associated with out of service violations 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices  emissions or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing trucking services 
possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  including changes intended to address climate change  restrictions  taxes or other controls on emissions  regulation specific to the fracing industry and logistics providers to the industry  changes in the hours of service regulations  which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  requirements leading to accelerated purchases of new trailers  mandatory limits on vehicle weight and size  and mandatory regulations imposed by the department of homeland security 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels and emissions  which may increase our or our independent affiliates operating costs  require capital expenditures or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
restrictions on emissions or other climate change laws or regulations could also affect our customers that use significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels in producing or delivering the products we carry 
we also could lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements 
our operations involve hazardous materials  which could create environmental liabilities 
our activities  particularly those relating to our handling  transporting and storage of bulk chemicals  are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulation by governmental authorities in the united states as well as foreign governmental authorities 
among other things  these environmental laws and regulations address emissions to the air  discharges onto land and into water  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and the health and safety of our employees 
these laws generally require us to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits 
most environmental laws provide for substantial fines  penalties and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
additionally  we have been  and may in the future be required to obtain financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  for environmental obligations 
environmental  health and safety laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
there can be no assurance that violations of such laws  regulations  permits or licenses will not be identified or occur in the future  or that such laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could impose material costs on us 
as a handler of hazardous substances  we are potentially subject to strict  joint and several liability for investigating and rectifying the consequences of spills and other environmental releases of these substances 
we have incurred remedial costs and regulatory penalties for chemical or wastewater spills and releases at our facilities or over the road 
as a result of environmental studies conducted at our facilities or at third party sites  we have identified environmental contamination at certain sites that will require remediation and we are currently conducting investigation and remediation projects at eight of our facilities 
future liabilities and costs under environmental  health  and safety laws are not easily predicted  and such liabilities could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business reputation 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  we have been named a potentially responsible party at various sites under the cercla and other environmental regulatory programs 
our current reserves provided for these sites may prove insufficient  which would result in future charges against earnings 
furthermore  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites could be material 
potential disruptions at us ports of entry could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any disruption of the delivery of intermodal iso tank containers to those ports where we do business would reduce the number of intermodal tank containers that we transport  store  clean or maintain 
this reduced activity may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if fuel prices increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela  and elsewhere  as well as hurricanes and other weather related events  and current and future legislation such as market based cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions control mechanisms  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have recovered the majority of the increases in fuel prices from chemical logistics and intermodal customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected may not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
to the extent fuel surcharges are insufficient to offset our fuel costs or we are unable to continue passing on increased fuel costs to our customers  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the loss of qualified drivers or other personnel could limit our growth and negatively affect operations 
during periods of high trucking volumes  there is substantial competition for qualified drivers in the trucking industry 
regulatory requirements  including csa discussed above  and an improvement in the economy could reduce the number of eligible drivers 
furthermore  certain geographic areas have a greater shortage of qualified drivers than other areas 
we operate in many of the geographic areas where there have been driver shortages in the past and have turned down new business opportunities as a result of the lack of qualified new drivers 
our voluntary implementation of eobrs prior to regulatory requirement has resulted in greater driver turnover in and could become an on going competitive disadvantage if our competitors are not compelled to implement eobrs as we anticipate 
difficulty in attracting qualified personnel  particularly qualified drivers  could require us to increase driver compensation  forego available customer opportunities and underutilize the tractors and trailers in our network 
these actions could result in increased costs and decreased revenues 
in addition  we may not be able to recruit other qualified personnel in the future 
our business may be harmed by terrorist attacks  future wars or anti terrorism measures 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   federal  state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks and fingerprinting of drivers in connection with new hazardous materials endorsements on their licenses 
such existing measures and future measures may have significant costs associated with them which a motor carrier is forced to bear 
moreover  large trucks carrying toxic chemicals are potential terrorist targets  and we may be obligated to take measures  including possible capital expenditures intended to protect our trucks 
in addition  the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could continue to increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we depend on members of our senior management 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends in large part on the continued employment of our senior management team 
if members of senior management become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  our business or financial results could be adversely affected 
our long lived assets are subject to potential asset impairment 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or approximately of our total assets and approximately of our non current assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
in addition  at december   net property and equipment totaled approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we review for potential goodwill impairment on an annual basis as part of our goodwill impairment testing in the second quarter of each year with a measurement date of june  and more often if a triggering event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment reviews performed as of june  and resulted in no impairment 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated there was goodwill impairment 
as a result of the analysis  we concluded that a total impairment charge to goodwill of million was necessary at june   of which million was related to our chemical logistics segment  eliminating of the carrying amount of goodwill of that segment  and million was related to our intermodal segment 
if there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values  if management s estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly  and could result in future impairment charges  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to successfully realize all of the intended benefits from future acquisitions  and we may be unable to identify or realize the intended benefits of potential future acquisition candidates 
we may be unable to realize all of the intended benefits of any future acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential future acquisitions  some of which could be material  and engage in discussions with acquisition candidates 
we cannot assure you that suitable acquisition candidates will be identified and acquired in the future  that the financing of any such acquisition will be available on satisfactory terms  that we will be able to complete any such acquisition or that we will be able to accomplish our strategic objectives as a result of any such acquisition 
nor can we assure you that our acquisition strategies will be viewed positively by customers or achieve their intended benefits 
often acquisitions are undertaken to improve the operating results of either or both the acquirer and the acquired company and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this regard 
we will encounter various risks in acquiring other companies  including the possible inability to integrate an acquired business into our operations  diversion of management s attention and unanticipated problems or liabilities  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements increased unionization could increase our operating costs or constrain operating flexibility 
although only approximately of our driver population  including independent owner operators and employees of independent affiliates  was subject to collective bargaining agreements at december   unions such as the international brotherhood of teamsters have traditionally been active in the us trucking industry 
unionized workers could disrupt our operations by strike  work stoppage or other slowdown 
in addition  our non union workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past  and we could be subject to future unionization 
increased unionization of our workforce could result in higher compensation and working condition demands that could increase our operating costs or constrain our operating flexibility 
if we withdraw from any of our multi employer pension plans  we will be liable for a proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefit liabilities upon our withdrawal 
as of december   we contributed to three multi employer pension plans for employees under collective bargaining agreements 
in conjunction with our prior restructuring efforts  during the third quarter of fiscal  we notified the trustees of three other plans of our intention to withdraw from the plans 
our withdrawal notifications were originally estimated to result in an aggregate withdrawal liability of approximately million  and we recorded a restructuring charge for this full amount in the third quarter of fiscal during the first nine months of fiscal  we made aggregate payments of approximately million to fully discharge the liabilities under these three pension plans and recorded a restructuring credit of million 
we do not currently intend to withdraw from the remaining three multi employer pension plans or take any actions that would subject us to payment of contingent obligations upon withdrawal 
based on information provided to us from the trustees of these remaining plans  we estimate our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination from these remaining plans to be approximately million  of which the largest component relates to the central states southeast and southwest areas pension plan  which is estimated to be million 
new markets such as the energy logistics market have risks with which we have limited experience  and we may not be able to operate profitably in these markets and may lose our investment 
in  we began hauling fresh water  disposal water and oil for the natural gas and oil drilling market 
although we have identified our existing contracts in this market as a source of revenue growth  we may prove unable to perform these contracts and earn anticipated revenue 
we have limited experience transporting fresh water and disposal water and oil or serving natural gas or oil drilling customers 
we plan to leverage our existing network of affiliates to expand or energy market business  but our existing network may prove unsuitable for this new business 
also  our market expansion requires certain capital expenditures for specialized trailers and other start up costs that we may be unable to recoup 
hydraulic fracturing is under significant legislative and regulatory scrutiny  the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal  state or local level could adversely affect our customers hydraulic fracturing operations  which could reduce demand for our logistics services 
in addition  heightened political  regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  whether directly or indirectly 
as we expand our business into this new market  we may face increased risks due to the cyclical nature of the energy industry 
depending on the market prices of oil and gas  customers in that industry may delay and decrease their capital and development expenditures  reducing the demand for our transportation services 
such market volatility may lead to fluctuations in results of operations from quarter to quarter 
natural gas prices in recent years have been at historic lows  leading some large producers to announce reduced fracing drilling 
if this continues  it could reduce our revenues 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete in this new market or that our operations in this market will be successful 
if we are unsuccessful  our operating margins  financial condition  cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected

index to financial statements risks related to our common stock we have a single shareholder who can substantially influence the outcome of all matters voted upon by our shareholders and prevent actions which a shareholder may otherwise view favorably 
as of march   apollo investment fund iii  lp and its affiliated funds apollo were our largest shareholder and owned or controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  apollo can influence substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions  the ability to block an unsolicited tender offer and any other matters requiring a vote of shareholders 
three of our board members are partners or employees of apollo 
this concentration of ownership and board representation could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination that a shareholder may otherwise view favorably 
our ability to issue blank check preferred stock and florida law may prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and florida law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a shareholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorization of the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares in order to control a takeover attempt which the board viewed unfavorably  elimination of the voting rights of shareholders with respect to shares that are acquired without prior board approval that would otherwise entitle such shareholder to exercise certain amounts of voting power in the election of directors  and prohibition on business combinations with interested shareholders unless particular conditions are met 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
future sales and issuances of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and result in dilution 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing shareholders of a large number of shares of our common stock 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   there are approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
approximately million shares of common stock  as of march   are restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act of or are held by affiliates

overview we operate the largest chemical bulk tank truck network in north america through our wholly owned subsidiary  qci  and are also the largest provider of intermodal iso tank container and depot services in north america through our wholly owned subsidiary  boasso which also includes greensville 
in  we entered the gas and oil frac shale energy markets  providing logistics services to these markets through our wholly owned subsidiaries  qcer 
we operate an asset light business model and service customers across north america through our network of independent affiliates  terminals servicing the chemical markets of which are operated by independent affiliates and which are company operated  company operated tank depot services terminals and terminals servicing the energy markets which are operated by independent affiliates 
financial reporting segments in connection with our entry into the gas and oil frac shale energy market in  a new segment for financial reporting purposes was identified during the fourth quarter of  to better distinguish logistics services to the energy markets from logistics services to the chemical markets based upon how these businesses are managed 
our previous logistics segment was renamed chemical logistics 
we have three reportable business segments for financial reporting purposes that are distinguished primarily on the basis of services offered chemical logistics  which consists of the transportation of bulk chemicals primarily through our network of independent affiliates  and equipment rental income  energy logistics  which consists primarily of the transportation of fresh water  disposal water and oil for the energy logistics markets  primarily through independent affiliates  and intermodal  which consists solely of boasso and greensville s international organization for standardization or intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services 
chemical logistics the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists mainly of liquid and dry bulk chemicals including plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we primarily coordinate the transport of a broad range of chemical products  primarily through our independent affiliate network  and provide our customers with logistics and other value added services 
we are a core carrier for many of the major companies engaged in chemical processing including arclin  arkema  ashland  basf  dow  dupont  exxonmobil  georgia pacific  honeywell  ppg industries  procter gamble  sunoco and unilever  and we provide services to most of the top chemical producers with north american operations 
we believe the diversity of our customer base  geography and end markets provides a competitive advantage 
we believe the specialized nature of the bulk tank truck industry  including specifically licensed drivers  specialized equipment and more stringent safety requirements  create barriers to entry which limit the more 
table of contents 
index to financial statements drastic swings in supply experienced by the broader trucking industry 
additionally  it is common practice in the bulk tank truck industry for customers to pay fuel surcharges  which helps enable recovery of fuel price increases from customers 
our transportation revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  prices  the average number of miles driven per load  our market share and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
the volume of shipments of chemical products is  in turn  affected by many diverse industries and end use markets  including consumer and industrial products  paints and coatings  paper and packaging  agriculture and food products  and tends to vary with changing economic conditions 
due to the nature of our customers business  our revenues are seasonal 
revenues generally decline during winter months  namely our first and fourth fiscal quarters and over holidays and rise during our second and third fiscal quarters 
highway transportation can be adversely affected depending upon the severity of the weather in various sections of the country during the winter months 
during periods of heavy snow  ice or rain  we may not be able to move our trucks and equipment between locations  thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues 
energy logistics beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  transportation revenue includes revenue earned from hauling fresh and disposal water for the energy market and in the fourth quarter of we began hauling oil 
this revenue is principally a function of the volume of shipments  price per hour of service  and the allocation of shipments between us and other carriers under logistics contracts we manage 
similar to the shipment of bulk chemicals  we expect revenues to generally be lower during the winter months  as drilling within certain shales that we service may be adversely affected by the severity of weather in various sections of the country 
intermodal our wholly owned subsidiary  boasso  which also includes greensville since november   is the largest north american providers of intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services  with nine terminals located in the eastern half of the united states 
in addition to intermodal tank transportation services  boasso and greensville provide tank cleaning  heating  testing  maintenance and storage services to customers 
boasso and greensville provide local and over the road trucking primarily within the proximity of the port cities where its depots are located 
boasso also sells equipment that its customers use for portable alternative storage or office space 
demand for intermodal iso tank containers is impacted by the aggregate volume of imports and exports of chemicals through united states ports  and boasso and greensville s revenues are accordingly impacted by this import export volume  in particular the number and volume of shipments through ports at which boasso and greensville have terminals  as well as their market share 
economic conditions and differences among the laws and currencies of foreign nations may also impact the volume of shipments 
our industry chemical logistics formerly logistics the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists mainly of liquid and dry bulk chemicals including plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we estimate  based on industry sources  that the highly fragmented north american for hire segment of the bulk transport market generated revenues of approximately billion in we specifically operate in the for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market which we estimated at billion in 
we believe we have the leading market share estimated at in in this sector based on revenues 
through our independent affiliate network  we operate the largest for hire chemical bulk tank truck network in north 
table of contents 
index to financial statements america comprising terminals  tractors and trailers 
we believe managing a larger carrier network facilitates customer service and lane density  and provides a more favorable cost structure for us and our independent affiliates 
as such  we believe we are well positioned to expand our business by increasing our market share 
the chemical bulk tank truck industry growth is generally dependent on volume growth in the industrial chemical industry  the rate at which chemical companies outsource their transportation needs  the overall capacity of the rail system  and  in particular the extent to which chemical companies make use of the rail system for their bulk chemical transportation needs 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth in our core business are the ability to obtain additional business from existing customers  add new customers  increase the utilization of our trailer fleet and add and retain qualified drivers 
our industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as the time and cost required to develop the operational infrastructure necessary to handle sensitive chemical cargo  the financial and managerial resources required to recruit and train drivers  substantial and increasingly more stringent industry regulatory requirements  strong customer relationships and the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment and establish a network of terminals and independent affiliates 
energy logistics in  we initiated a growth strategy targeting the gas and oil frac shale energy market through our wholly owned subsidiaries  qcer 
we currently serve several customers and operate approximately units of energy equipment in this market 
in our third quarter of  qcer won a multi year contract with a major energy company to provide full logistics of their fresh and disposal water hauling needs in the marcellus shale region of pennsylvania 
the logistics revenues associated with this contract began in the third quarter of and are expected to provide significant revenue and growth prospects for the future 
in our fourth quarter of  we began hauling oil in the eagle ford shale region of texas which we expect to provide revenue and growth prospects for the future as well 
we believe this market has significant revenue potential and we may realize higher margins and better equipment utilization than we experience in our chemical logistics business 
in connection with our entry into this business  due to the attractive return profile associated with this business  we may operate a portion of the business through company operated terminals  rather than through independent affiliates  which could affect the overall mix of our asset light business 
intermodal we estimate that the north american intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services market generated revenues of approximately million in  and we believe boasso and greensville  collectively have the leading market share 
the intermodal iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the proliferation of global import export of bulk liquid chemicals has driven the movement of basic manufacturing out of the united states and has resulted in an increase in chemical plant infrastructure to service these off shore industries 
driven by this globalization  the intermodal iso tank container market is a growing sector of the overall liquid bulk chemical transportation sector 
furthermore  chemical manufacturers have sought to efficiently transport their products by utilizing iso tank containers 
the resulting demand for distributors that can offer a broad range of services within the supply chain will drive future growth in this sector 
we believe that our intermodal business will benefit from these trends because of its market leadership  experience and track record 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our network our bulk service network consists primarily of independently owned third party affiliate terminals  independent owner operator drivers and  to a lesser extent  company operated terminals 
independent affiliates are independent companies we contract with to operate trucking terminals exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the independent affiliates provide the capital necessary to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
independent owner operators are generally individual drivers who own or lease their tractors and agree to provide transportation services to us under contract 
we believe the use of independent affiliates and independent owner operators provides the following key competitive advantages to us in the marketplace locally owned and operated independent affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
independent affiliates and independent owner operators generally are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue collected on each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that mitigates against cyclical downturns 
reliance on independent affiliates and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model that generally reduces our capital investment 
due to several factors  including our ownership of the customer contracts and relationships  the presence of non compete agreements with the independent affiliates  and our ownership of the trailers  our relationships with the independent affiliates tend to be long term in nature  with minimal voluntary turnover 
given the specialty nature of the services we provide and the size of our existing network  we believe there are significant barriers to entry to our industry 
during  we continued our plan that began in of consolidating certain company operated terminals and transitioning other company operated terminals to independent affiliates 
these actions resulted in a larger portion of our revenue being generated by independent affiliates and a reduced number of terminals in our network 
during the second half of and during  we aggressively reduced the number of aged and underutilized specialty trailers in our fleet 
we believe these actions have reduced certain fixed costs  provide a more variable cost structure and position us with a financially flexible  asset light business platform 
we believe the most significant factors relevant to our future business growth are the ability to i expand into new markets  specifically the energy markets  ii add new customers  iii obtain additional business from existing customers  iv add and retain qualified drivers and v improve the utilization of our trailer fleet 
while many of our customers source some of their logistics needs with rail  we expect our customers to continue to outsource a greater proportion of their logistics needs to full service tank truck carriers 
as a result of our leading market position  strong customer relationships and flexible business model  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from customers seeking consolidation of their shipping relationships and those opting to outsource a greater portion of their logistics needs to third party tank truck carriers

the assets sold had a net book value of million which included million of equipment  million of inventory  and million of intangibles 
the sold qsi business generated approximately million of revenue in from tank wash and related operations 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million in the fourth quarter of as part of our operating income 
we believe the changes in our business activities as a result of the sale of the tank wash business will reduce our environmental compliance costs going forward 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
the asset lives used are presented in the following table average lives in years buildings and improvements tractors and terminal equipment trailers energy market equipment furniture and fixtures other equipment tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service 
any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales or disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the second quarter with a measurement date of june  and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by determining the fair value for 
table of contents 
index to financial statements each reporting unit to which our goodwill relates 
at june   our intermodal segment was our only reporting unit that contained goodwill 
at december   our intermodal segment contains goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with our boasso acquisition in december and our greensville acquisition in november the methodology applied in the analysis performed at june  was consistent with the methodology applied in prior years  but was based on updated assumptions  as appropriate 
as a result of our analysis  we concluded no impairment had occurred as of june  and as a result of our analysis at june   a total impairment charge to goodwill of million was necessary  of which million was related to our chemical logistics segment  eliminating of the carrying amount of goodwill of that segment  and million was related to our intermodal segment 
we continued to evaluate indicators of impairment quarterly following our annual goodwill impairment test at june  through year end  including the quarter ended december  there were no indications that a triggering event had occurred as of december  as of december   we had total goodwill of million  all of which was allocated to intermodal segment 
as of december   we had total intangibles of million  of which million was allocated to our intermodal segment and million was allocated to our chemical logistics segment 
goodwill under the fasb guidance  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in the first step  we determine whether there is an indication of impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if  based on the first step  we determine that there is an indication of goodwill impairment  we assess the impairment in step two in accordance with the fasb guidance 
in the first step  we determine the fair value for each reporting unit using a combination of two valuation approaches the market approach and the income approach 
the market approach uses a guideline company methodology which is based upon a comparison of us to similar publicly traded companies within our industry 
we derive a market value of invested capital or business enterprise value for each comparable company by multiplying the price per share of common stock of the publicly traded companies by their total common shares outstanding and adding each company s current level of debt 
we calculate a business enterprise multiple based on revenue and earnings from each company then apply those multiples to each reporting unit s revenue and earnings to conclude a reporting unit business enterprise value 
assumptions regarding the selection of comparable companies are made based on  among other factors  capital structure  operating environment and industry 
as the comparable companies were typically larger and more diversified than our reporting units  multiples were adjusted prior to application to our reporting units revenues and earnings to reflect differences in margins  long term growth prospects and market capitalization 
the income approach uses a discounted debt free cash flow analysis to measure fair value by estimating the present value of future economic benefits 
to perform the discounted debt free cash flow analysis  we develop a pro forma analysis of each reporting unit to estimate future available debt free cash flow and discounting estimated debt free cash flow by an estimated industry weighted average cost of capital based on the same comparable companies used in the market approach 
per the fasb guidance  the weighted average cost of capital is based on inputs eg  capital structure  risk  etc 
from a market participant s perspective and not necessarily from the reporting unit or qdi s perspective 
future cash flow is projected based on assumptions for our economic growth  industry expansion  future operations and the discount rate  all of which require significant judgments by management 
after computing a separate business enterprise value under the income approach and market approach  we apply a weighting to them to derive the business enterprise value of the reporting unit 
the income approach and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements market approach were both weighted in the analysis performed at june  the weightings are evaluated each time a goodwill impairment assessment is performed and give consideration to the relative reliability of each approach at that time 
given that the business enterprise value derived from the market approach supported what was calculated in the income approach  we believed that both approaches should be equally weighted 
based on these weightings we calculated a business enterprise value for the reporting unit 
we then add debt free liabilities of the reporting unit to the calculated business enterprise value to derive an implied fair value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value is then compared to the reporting unit s carrying value of total assets 
upon completion of the analysis in step one  we determined that the fair value of our intermodal reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
as such  a step two analysis was not required 
intangible assets to determine the implied fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method  pursuant to which those assets are valued by reference to the amount of royalty income they would generate if licensed in an arm s length transaction 
under the relief from royalty method  similar to the discounted cash flow method  estimated net revenues expected to be generated by the asset during its life are multiplied by a benchmark royalty rate and then discounted by the estimated weighted average cost of capital associated with the asset 
the resulting capitalized royalty stream is an indication of the value of owning the asset 
based upon management s review of the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets in our intermodal segment  we determined that the implied fair value exceeded its carrying value 
if there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values  if management s estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values for each reporting unit and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly  and could result in future impairment charges  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax asset in accordance with fasb guidance  we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded or released against our deferred tax assets 
we continue to evaluate quarterly the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets 
the company reviews a rolling thirty six month calculation of us earnings  and considers other criteria at each reporting date  to determine if the company has incurred cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses in recent years pose significant negative evidence regarding the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets 
if we determine in a future reporting period that we will be able to use some or all of our deferred tax assets  the adjustment to reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance would reduce our tax expense and increase net income 
changes in deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are reflected in the provision for income taxes line in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the second quarter of  an impairment charge of million was recorded and as a result the company determined that it was in a cumulative loss position 
based on this negative evidence we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that the company s net deferred tax asset was realizable 
for purposes of assessing realizability of the deferred tax assets  this cumulative financial reporting loss position is considered significant negative evidence the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
as a result  a million deferred tax valuation allowance was recorded 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  operating results or other factors 
if any of these factors and related estimates change in the future  it may increase or decrease the valuation allowance and related income tax expense in the same period 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance against the balance of the net deferred tax asset in the current period

uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb guidance  we account for uncertainty in income taxes  using a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition and measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit and or an additional charge to the tax provision 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information  but estimates of environmental reserves and exposures may be affected by information subsequently received 
accrued loss and damage claims we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  independent owner operators and independent affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles of million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and million for workers compensation 
as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under the policy 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
as of december   we had million in an outstanding letter of credit to our insurance administrator to guarantee the self insurance portion of our liability 
if we fail to meet certain terms of our agreement  the insurance administrator may draw down the letter of credit 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on professional third party claims administrators  insurance company estimates and the judgment of our own personnel  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenue  including fuel surcharges and related costs  is recognized on the date freight is delivered 
service revenue consists primarily of rental revenues primarily tractor and trailer rental  intermodal and depot revenues  tank wash revenues and insurance related administrative services 
rental revenues from independent affiliates  independent owner operators and third parties are recognized ratably over the lease period 
intermodal and depot revenues  consisting primarily of repair and storage services  are recognized when the services are rendered 
during the period that we operated our tank wash business  tank wash revenues were recognized when the wash was completed 
insurance related administrative service revenues are recorded ratably over the service period 
we recognize all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted with our customers

index to financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to independent owner operators and independent affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
stock compensation plans stock compensation is determined by the assumptions required under the fasb guidance 
the fair values of stock option grants are based upon the black scholes option pricing model and amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
restricted stock awards are issued and measured at market value on the date of grant and related compensation expense is recognized over time on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was million and million  respectively  for fiscal year as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock based awards 
the recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost generally varies from two to four years 
for further discussion on stock based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain vested salaried participants and retirees and certain other vested participants and retirees under an expired collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
we had an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million at december  and an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million at december  the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan 
at december   our projected benefit obligation pbo was million 
our projected net periodic pension expense is million 
a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a decrease in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would increase our net periodic pension expense to million 
a increase in our assumed rate of return would not change our pbo but would decrease our net periodic pension expense to million

year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in transportation revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in new energy logistics revenue of million generated primarily from our delivery of fresh and disposal water in the frac shale energy market  most of which was generated in the second half of the year  and an increase of million in our intermodal business 
this was partially offset by a decrease in chemical logistics revenue of million due to a decrease in bulk chemical shipments 
we expect transportation services to the energy market to be a significant contributor to our revenue growth in in  our chemical logistics business was adversely affected by a high level of driver turnover primarily driven by our installation of eobrs in our fleet 
we installed eobrs in all of our us fleet in order to improve efficiency and proactively address regulatory requirements that we expect in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through our variable rate borrowings under the new abl facility 
with regard to the new abl facility at qd llc s option  the applicable margin for borrowings at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for such borrowings will be reduced or increased based on aggregate borrowing base availability under the new abl facility over the life of the new abl facility

the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous point increase in the rates under the new abl facility and that the principal amount is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness are based  our various options to elect the lower of different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency

we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our inter company loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our chemical logistics and intermodal customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges can be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel costs were covered through fuel surcharges
