item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk to be wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the relative consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities  or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management from various functional areas  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on various assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and market interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed bi monthly and reviewed and documented by the alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
forecasting changes in net interest income requires management to make certain assumptions regarding loan and security prepayment rates  bond call dates  and adjustments to non maturing deposit rates  which may not necessarily reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market 
table of contents interest rates 
assumptions used are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while management believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non maturing deposit rates will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve  regardless of the duration of the maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis may not be indicative of actual results 
in addition  the analysis may not consider all actions that management could employ in response to changes in interest rates and various earning asset and costing liability balances 
management is aware of the significant effect inflation or deflation has upon interest rates and ultimately upon financial performance 
wesbanco s ability to cope with inflation or deflation is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing market interest rates  as well as its ability to manage the various elements of non interest income and expense during periods of increasing or decreasing inflation or deflation 
wesbanco monitors the level and mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation or deflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation or deflation by conducting periodic reviews of the prices and terms of its various products and services  both in terms of the costs to offer the services as well as outside market influences upon such pricing  by introducing new products and services or reducing the availability of existing products and services  and by controlling overhead expenses 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained and basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to a stable rate environment or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to a reduction of and or less  respectively  of net interest income from the base model over a twelve month period 
the table below shows wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at december  and december  assuming both a and basis point interest rate change  compared to a base model 
due to the current low interest rate environment  particularly for short term rates  the basis point decreasing change is not calculated  and instead a basis point rising rate environment is shown 
the policy limit for an increasing basis point rising rate environment is a negative 
table net interest income sensitivity immediate change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income from base over one year alco guidelines december  december  as per the table above  the earnings simulation model at december  currently projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by if interest rates were to fall immediately by basis points  compared to a decrease of for the same scenario as of december  for rising rate scenarios  net interest income would increase by  and if rates increased by  and basis points  respectively  as of december  compared to increases of  and in a  and basis point increasing rate environment as of december  
table of contents the balance sheet is slightly less asset sensitive at year end  compared to both september  and december  due to a duration extension and higher balances in the investment portfolio  and changes in the deposit mix and the overall level and term of short term borrowings  offset somewhat by greater short term liquidity 
should rates rise more rapidly and by a higher amount  which is not currently anticipated in the short term  the asset sensitivity may be somewhat neutralized due to slower anticipated prepayment speeds and extension risk associated with residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  variable rate commercial loans with rate floors approximated million at december   which represented approximately of commercial loans with an average floor of 
in the current flat to decreasing interest rate environment  wesbanco expects that the net interest margin may be somewhat negatively impacted throughout  as short term interest rates are not anticipated to increase until possibly late  and loan runoff and investment security maturities are necessarily reinvested at lower rates 
competition for new quality loans may also result in reduced spread income from the loan portfolio 
the bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of pittsburgh  the federal reserve bank of cleveland  and various correspondent banks  and may utilize these funding sources as necessary to mitigate the impact on our balance sheet of embedded options in commercial and residential loans and to lengthen liabilities to help offset mismatches in various asset maturities 
cdars deposits have also been used to lengthen maturities in certificates of deposit  primarily in years prior to current balance sheet strategies to reduce the impact of decreasing margins in a low rate environment  where asset yields continue to reduce as reinvestment of cash flows occur and liability costs are not able to be reduced in the same proportion  include increasing fixed rate loans  primarily commercial and residential  investing non essential available short term liquidity  marketing programs to increase the mix of certain types of transaction accounts versus short term cds  reinvestment of securities cash flows into a mix of short to intermediate term cmos and year state and municipal securities  utilizing swaps for certain new commercial real estate loans  and paying down maturing fhlb and other short term borrowings with available cash 
as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a less likely scenario 
the simulation model at december   using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis  projects that net interest income would increase over the next twelve months  compared to a increase at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of tangible equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of tangible equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment indicates an increase of compared to an increase of at december  in a basis point falling rate environment  the model indicates an increase of  compared to a decrease of as of december  wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to minus for a basis point change in interest rates  as long as the tier leverage capital ratio is not forecasted to decrease below as a result of the change 
most of the increase in economic value of tangible equity year over year is as a result of changes in market values associated with certain deposit liabilities  specifically reflecting growth in non interest bearing demand deposits and other transaction account types  while short term maturing cds and the payoff of maturing fhlb borrowings also improved the total liability valuation 
in a rising rate environment  non interest bearing deposits and other low cost transaction accounts are worth more than in the current low interest rate environment or if rates were to drop by basis points 
for liabilities  this equates to a below cost fair market value as rates rise  which results in increased equity fair value
