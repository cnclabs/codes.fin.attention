item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  pra  company  we  us and our refer to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve  and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses also referred to as loss and loss adjustment expenses  incurred losses  losses incurred  and losses 
incurred losses reported in any period reflect our estimate of losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for losses of prior periods 
the estimation of professional liability losses is inherently difficult and is the subject of significant judgment on the part of management 
loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  can vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the claim and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and  for mpl claims  the trend of healthcare costs 
professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of significant judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
our reserves are established by management after taking into consideration a variety of factors including premium rates  claims frequency  historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation  general economic trends  the legal and political environment  and the conclusions reached by our internal and consulting actuaries 
we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses each reporting period and make adjustments to loss estimation assumptions that we believe best reflect emerging data 
both our internal and consulting actuaries perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on at least a semi annual basis using the loss and exposure data of our insurance subsidiaries 
we engage consulting actuaries to review our data and provide us with their observations regarding our data and the adequacy of our established reserve  believing that the consulting actuaries provide an independent view of our loss data as well as a broader perspective on industry loss trends 

table of contents we analyze our reserves in a variety of ways and use multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses  including bornhuetter ferguson paid and reported method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method a brief description of each method follows 
bornhuetter ferguson method 
we use both the paid and the reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year initial expected losses being the first established case and ibnr reserves for a specific accident year and partial weight to paid to date losses 
the reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current expected losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development and reported development method 
these methods use historical  cumulative losses paid losses for the paid development method  reported losses for the reported development method by accident year and develop those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment and case reserving environment for the reported development method  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
average paid value and average reported value methods 
in these methods  average claim cost data paid claim cost for the average paid value method and reported claim cost for the reported value method is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data 
claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level 
the average claim cost after rounding and adjustment  if necessary  to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and alae 
backward recursive development method 
this method is an extrapolation on the movements in case reserve adequacy in order to estimate unpaid loss costs 
historical data showing incremental changes to case reserves over progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the ratio of case reserve values at successive maturities 
historical claims payment data showing the additional payments in progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the portion of a case reserve paid in the following period 
starting from the most mature period  after which all of the case reserve is paid and the case reserve is exhausted  the next prior ultimate development factor for the prior case reserve can be calculated as the case factor times the established ultimate development factor plus the paid factor 
for each successive prior maturity  the ultimate development factor is calculated similarly 
the result of multiplying the ultimate development factor times the case reserve is the total indicated unpaid amount 
generally  methods such as the bornhuetter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year  we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods  as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
these methods emphasize different aspects of loss reserve estimation and provide a variety of perspectives for our decisions 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends when establishing our reserves 

table of contents we segment our reserves by accident year  which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability 
as claims are incurred reported and claim payments are made  they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes 
we also segment our reserves by reserve type case reserves and ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established by our claims department based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs often referred to as expected losses that will be paid on reported claims 
case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised  reported loss is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date 
ibnr reserves represent our estimate of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us and future developments on losses that have been reported to us 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management taking into consideration the actuarial methods and other environmental factors discussed previously 
for each partition of our business  we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
the series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
we utilize the selected point estimates of ultimate losses to develop estimates of ultimate losses recoverable from reinsurers  based on the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
an overall estimate of the amount receivable from reinsurers is determined by combining the individual estimates 
our net reserve estimate is the sum of the gross reserve point estimate and the estimated reinsurance recovery 
because of the number of data points and variables considered and the subjective process followed in establishing our loss reserve  it is impractical to isolate individual variables and demonstrate their impact on our estimate of loss reserves 
however  to provide a better understanding of the potential variability in our reserves  we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point net reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our net reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried net reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion any change in our estimate of net ultimate losses for prior years is reflected in net income in the period in which such changes are made 
over the past several years such changes have been to reduce our estimate of net ultimate losses  resulting in a reduction of reported losses for the period and a corresponding increase in income 
due to the size of our reserve for losses and the large number of claims outstanding at any point in time  even a small percentage adjustment to our total reserve estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 

table of contents initial reserve estimates in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year  due to the lack of available data for both open and closed claims for that accident year  we heavily rely on the loss assumptions that are used in our pricing models 
historically  and at present  we utilize loss ratios that are approximately to percentage points above the ratios incorporated within the pricing targets for that accident year 
we believe this considers inherent risks associated with our rate development process and the historic volatility of professional liability losses the industry has experienced accident year loss ratios as high as and as low as over the past years and produces a reasonable best estimate of the reserves required to cover actual ultimate unpaid losses 
in the current environment this equates to an initial loss ratio of approximately as compared to an average loss ratio of approximately assumed in our pricing 
the effect of changing severity severity is defined as the average cost of resolving claims 
the severity trend assumption is a key assumption for both pricing models and actuarial estimation of reserves 
our current pricing model assumes a severity trend of 
if the severity trend were to be higher by percentage point  the impact would be an increase in our expected loss ratio of percentage points 
an increase in the severity trend of percentage points would result in a percentage point increase in our expected loss ratio 
due to the long tailed nature of mpl claims and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs  selection of a severity trend assumption is a subjective process that is inherently likely to prove inaccurate over time 
given this long tail and the previously discussed historical volatility of loss costs  we are generally cautious in making changes to the severity assumptions within our pricing model 
recent changes in frequency have also complicated the selection of an appropriate severity trend 
both our internal and consulting actuaries have observed fluctuating but generally lower claims frequency that cannot be attributed to any single factor 
we believe that much of the reduction in the number of claims is the result of a decline in the filing of frivolous lawsuits that have historically been dismissed or otherwise result in no payment of indemnity on the part of our insureds 
with fewer frivolous claims being filed we expect that the claims that are filed have the potential for greater average losses  or greater severity 
as a result  we cannot be certain as to the impact this decline will ultimately have on the average cost of claims 
based on a weighted average of payments  resolution of of claims for a given accident year requires more than eight years based on a weighted average of payments 
due to this long tail  it will be several years before we are able to determine if the decline in frequency has indeed resulted in a related increase in severity 
we are cautious in giving full credibility to emerging trends that  when more fully mature  may lead to the recognition of either favorable or adverse development of our losses 
there may be trends  both positive and negative  reflected in the numerical data both within our own information and in the broader mpl marketplace that mitigate or reverse as time progresses and additional data becomes available 
for these reasons  we have not significantly reduced the severity rate used in our pricing models 
however  as discussed above  certain of the methodologies utilized to estimate the ultimate losses for each reserve partition consider the actual amounts paid 
paid data is particularly influential when a large portion of known claims have been closed  as is the case for older accident years 
in selecting a point estimate for each partition  management considers the extent to which trends are emerging consistently for all partitions and known industry trends 
thus  actual  rather than estimated  severity trends are given consideration 
when actual severity trends are lower than those estimated at the time that reserves were initially established  the recognition of favorable development is indicated 
this is particularly true for older accident years where our actuarial methodologies give more weight to actual loss costs severity 

table of contents loss development the following tables present additional information about our loss development estimated ultimate losses  net of reinsurance ultimates for and include ultimates associated with the reserves assumed in business combinations 
in thousands  n a n a   n a and prior reserve development  favorable unfavorable in thousands  n a and prior the change in the estimate of ultimate losses is the result of management s judgment about the ultimate cost of resolving claims 
while management considers a variety of variables in estimating losses  as discussed previously  actual results as compared to management s initial estimate of loss severity trends as compared to actual results has been the most influential factor in our recognition of favorable reserve development 
in general  management has assumed that severity trends would prove to be higher than actual results have indicated over the past several years 
with the decline in the frequency of claims that both we and the industry have observed over the past five years  we had anticipated that the quality of claims would improve which would lead to higher average claim values and a higher severity trend 
while the increase in severity has not been at the level we anticipated  management continues to believe that an increase in severity is a likely ultimate outcome of a lower frequency environment 
an extended period of time is required to get a clear estimate of the loss cost for a given accident year 
as an example  at the end of we had resolved of the known claims for the accident year 
this statistic is based on the number of reported claims  since many non meritorious claims are resolved early  the percentage of ultimate loss payments known at the same point in time is considerably lower 
at the end of  this had increased by to of the known claims and by the end of approximately of known claims had been resolved 
a similar pattern can be seen in each open accident year as demonstrated in the table above 
historically we have resolved more than of our physician and hospital professional liability claims with no indemnity payment and generally these claims are the first to be resolved 
as an accident year matures  we see an increase in the number of claims that are resolved with indemnity payments 
in a similar fashion  we typically expend more in loss adjustment expenses legal fees as claims mature 
the following table represents the percentage of known mpl claims closed accident year n a n a n a  and 
table of contents based upon the additional claims closed during  and  as shown above  and the continuation of better than expected severity trends  management reduced its expected ultimate losses in both and resulting in the recognition of corresponding amounts of favorable development in the income statements of those periods 
reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to confirm that there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december   all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
our assessment of the collectability of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 
given the uncertainty inherent in our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable from reinsurers  these estimates may vary significantly from the ultimate outcome 
under the terms of certain of our reinsurance agreements  the amount of premium that we cede to our reinsurers is based in part on the losses we recover under the agreements 
therefore we make an estimate of premiums ceded under these reinsurance agreements subject to certain maximums and minimums 
any adjustments to our estimates of either balances recoverable under our reinsurance agreements or premiums owed under our agreements are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
we make a determination of the amount of insurance risk we choose to retain based upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the placement of our reinsurance program and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
the determination of which reinsurers we choose to do business with is based upon an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer as of december   however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our claim for reimbursement from them based upon their interpretation of the terms of our agreements 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the 
table of contents amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be material to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity 
investment valuations we record the majority of our investments at fair value as shown in the table below 
the distribution of our investments based on gaap fair value hierarchies levels is as follows distribution by gaap fair value hierarchy december  level level level total investments fair value investments not at fair value total investments fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
all of our fixed maturity and equity security investments are carried at fair value 
our short term securities are carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
because of the number of securities we own and the complexity and cost of developing accurate fair values  we utilize multiple independent pricing services to assist us in establishing the fair value of individual securities 
the pricing services provide fair values based on exchange traded prices  if available 
if an exchange traded price is not available  the pricing services  if possible  provide a fair value that is based on multiple broker dealer quotes or that has been developed using pricing models 
pricing models vary by asset class and utilize currently available market data for securities comparable to ours to estimate the fair value for our security 
the pricing services scrutinize market data for consistency with other relevant market information before including the data in the pricing models 
the pricing services disclose the types of pricing models used and the inputs used for each asset class 
determining fair values using these pricing models requires the use of judgment to identify appropriate comparable securities and to choose a valuation methodology that is appropriate for the asset class and available data 
the pricing services provide a single value per instrument quoted 
we review the values provided for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied value versus market yields observed in the market place 
in addition  we compare provided information for consistency with our other pricing services  known market data and information from our own trades  considering both values and valuation trends 
we also compare yields indicated by the provided values to appropriate benchmark yields and review for values that are unchanged or that reflect an unanticipated variation as compared to prior period values 
we also review weekly trades versus the prices supplied by our vendors 
if a supplied value is deemed unreasonable  we discuss the valuation in question with the pricing service and will make adjustments if deemed necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted any values supplied by the pricing services 
the pricing services do not provide a fair value unless an exchange traded price or multiple observable inputs are available 
as a result  the pricing services may provide a fair value for a security in some periods but not others  depending upon the level of recent market activity for the security or comparable securities 
level investments as of december   fair values for our equity and a portion of our short term securities have been determined using an exchange traded price 
there is little judgment involved when fair value is determined using an exchange traded price 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify securities valued using an exchange traded price as level securities 

table of contents level investments with the exception of certain government bonds  most fixed income securities do not trade daily and thus exchange traded prices are generally not available for these securities 
however  market information often referred to as observable inputs or market data  including but not limited to  last reported trade  non binding broker quotes  bids  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  offers  and recent data regarding assumed prepayment speeds  cash flow and loan performance data is available for most of our fixed income securities 
we determine fair value for a large portion of our fixed income securities using available market information 
in accordance with gaap  for disclosure purposes we classify any securities that have been valued based on multiple market observable inputs as level securities 
level investments when a pricing service does not provide a value for one of our fixed maturity securities  management estimates fair value using either a single non binding broker quote or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs 
the process involves significant judgment in selecting the appropriate data and modeling techniques to use in the valuation process 
for disclosure purposes we classify fixed maturity securities that are valued using limited observable inputs as level securities 
we also classify as level securities our limited partnership and limited liability company lp llc interests that are carried at fair value  based on the quarterly net asset value nav provided to us by the lp llc managers 
at december  such investments total million or of total investments 
all investments valued in this manner are interests in private investment funds that hold debt and equity securities 
of the total  million relates to interests  included in investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  which are accounted for using the equity method because we are deemed to have an other than minor interest in the lp llc 
an interest in an llc  which has a fair value at december  of million and is included in other investments  is accounted for using the cost method because our interest in the llc is a minor interest 
this llc has announced its intention to convert to a public fund in the near term  and we recognized an other than temporary impairment otti during to reduce the carrying value of our interest to the nav reported by the llc manager 

table of contents investments not at fair value investments having a carrying value of approximately million or of total investments are not carried at fair value  as required by gaap for the type of investment 
refer to the following table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details in millions carrying value gaap measurement method other investments interests in lps cost federal home loan bank fhlb capital stock cost other investments cost investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries interests in tax credit partnerships equity interest in a business llc equity business owned life insurance cash surrender value investment impairments we evaluate our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value that represent ottis 
in all instances we consider an impairment to be an otti if we intend to sell the security or if we believe we will be required to sell the security before we fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security 
otherwise  we consider various factors in our evaluation  depending upon the type of security  as discussed below 
for debt securities  we consider whether we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis of the security  based upon consideration of some or all of the following third party research and credit rating reports  the current credit standing of the issuer  including credit rating downgrades  extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with an investment or its issuer  our internal assessments and those of our external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment  which can cause us to believe the investment is more or less likely to recover its value than other investments with a similar structure  for asset backed securities  the origination date of the underlying loans  the remaining average life  the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future  and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in assessing whether we expect to recover the cost basis of debt securities  particularly asset backed securities  we must make a number of assumptions regarding the cash flows that we expect to receive from the security in future periods 
these judgments are subjective in nature and may subsequently be proved to be inaccurate 
we evaluate our cost method interests in lps llcs for otti by considering whether there has been a decline in fair value below the recorded value  which involves assumptions and estimates 
we receive a report from each of the lps llcs at least quarterly which provides us a nav for our interest in the lp llc 
the nav is based on the fair values of securities held by the lp llc as determined by the lp llc manager 
we consider the most recent nav provided  the performance of the lp llc relative to the market  the stated objectives of the lp llc  the cash flows expected from the lp llc and audited financial statements of the entity  if available  in considering whether an otti exists 

table of contents our investments in tax credit partnerships are evaluated for otti by comparing cash flow projections of the underlying projects generating the tax credits to our recorded basis  and considering our ability to utilize the tax credits generated by the investments 
we also evaluate our holdings of fhlb securities for impairment 
we consider the current capital status of the fhlb  whether the fhlb is in compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements  and the reported operating results of the current period 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries which are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal premiums are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs each reporting period  and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
beginning january   in order to comply with adopted financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  we will no longer capitalize internal selling agent and underwriter salary and benefit costs that are allocated to unsuccessful insurance contracts 
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
deferred taxes deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes 
our temporary differences principally relate to loss reserves  unearned premiums  deferred policy acquisition costs  unrealized investment gains losses and investment impairments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized 
we review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about our future operations based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences  carryback capacity  future taxable income including its capital and operating characteristics and tax planning strategies 
unrecognized tax benefits we evaluate tax positions taken on tax returns and recognize positions in our financial statements when it is more likely than not that we will sustain the position upon resolution with a taxing authority 
if recognized  the benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent probability of being realized 
we review uncertain tax positions each period  considering changes in facts and circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law  and make adjustments as we consider necessary 
adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense and settlement of uncertain tax positions may require the use of cash 
at december   our current tax liability includes million for unrecognized tax benefits  and million for accrued interest related to unpaid taxes 

table of contents goodwill management evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter 
if  at any time during the year  events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value  we also evaluate goodwill at that time 
we evaluate goodwill as one reporting unit because we operate in a single operating segment and our segment components are economically similar 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit on the evaluation date based on market capitalization and an expected premium that would be paid to acquire control of our company a control premium 
we then perform a sensitivity analysis using a range of historical stock prices and control premiums 
we concluded in   and that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary 

table of contents proassurance overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are primarily derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  which principally write medical and other professional liability insurance 
corporate strategy our mission is to be the preferred source of professional liability protection by providing unparalleled claims defense  highly responsive customer service and innovative risk management while maintaining our commitment to long term financial strength 
according to am best s analysis of data  we are the nation s largest independent publicly traded insurance writer specializing in mpl coverage 
our customer focus combined with our financial strength  strong reputation and proven ability to manage claims  has played a role in our ability to expand our operations while maintaining profitability 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and expect to continue to grow through acquisitions  although we cannot predict the timing of those transactions with any certainty 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and prudent pricing in order to achieve profitability as opposed to emphasizing premium growth and achieving market share gain at any cost 
in addition to prudent risk selection and pricing  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management  and have fostered a strong culture of defending non meritorious claims 
we differentiate proassurance from many other national writers by tailoring our claims handling to the legal climate of each state 
through our market based underwriting and claims office structure  we develop a deep understanding of market conditions  which enables us to respond to changes in the liability climate and adapt our underwriting and claims strategies as needed 
our market based focus allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers  understand the importance of the professional identity and reputation of our insureds and thus be more responsive to their needs 
we use advisory boards and operational committees to help us better understand the challenges facing our insureds and ways in which we can assist them 
we believe the extensive experience of medical and legal professionals throughout our organization  especially that of our senior management team  enhances our understanding of the medical legal environment 
we emphasize our pledge that each insured professional will be treated fairly in all of our conduct with them and that all of our business actions will be informed by the core values that guide our organization integrity  respect  doctor involvement in healthcare insurance activities  collaboration  communication and enthusiasm 
we believe our strategy allows us to compete on a basis other than price alone 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices and through conservative investment practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we manage our business to protect our financial security 
we consider a number of performance measures  including the following the net loss ratio is calculated as net losses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability 
the underwriting expense ratio is calculated as underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned and is a component of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the underwriting expense ratio and the net loss ratio and measures underwriting profitability 

table of contents the investment income ratio is calculated as net investment income divided by net premiums earned and measures the contribution investment earnings provides to our overall profitability 
the operating ratio is the combined ratio  less the investment income ratio 
this ratio incorporates the effect of investment income and underwriting profitability 
the tax ratio is calculated as total income tax expense divided by income loss before income taxes and measures our effective tax rate 
return on equity is calculated as net income for the period divided by the average of beginning and ending shareholders equity 
this ratio measures our overall after tax profitability from underwriting and investment activity and shows how efficiently invested capital is being used 
book value per share is calculated as total shareholders equity at the balance sheet date divided by the total number of common shares outstanding 
this ratio measures the net worth of the company to shareholders on a per share basis 
growth in book value per share is an indicator of overall profitability 
we particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
our emphasis on rate adequacy  selective underwriting  effective claims management and prudent investments is a key factor in our achievement of our roe target 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
while we engage in activities that generate other income  such activities  principally fee and insurance agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion of our existing operations and through the acquisition of other specialty insurance companies or books of business 
growth through acquisition is often opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we operate in very competitive markets and  in addition to competition from other insurance companies  we are seeing a trend toward the formation of larger medical practice groups and the employment of physicians by hospitals 
frequently  given the size of these organizations  they choose to manage their medical liability exposure outside of the traditional insurance marketplace using self insured mechanisms and other risk sharing arrangements 
in response to these trends  we offer products designed to provide greater risk sharing options to hospitals and large physician groups 
we believe our emphasis on fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders through our commitment to treated fairly has enhanced our market position and differentiated us from other insurers 
we will continue to use treated fairly in all of our activities  and we believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will continue to improve retention and add new insureds 
we have been a consistent acquirer of other physician insurers for a number of years  including aps in in addition  in we expanded our insured base in new directions by acquiring a leading insurer of podiatric physicians that operates on a national basis  an insurer focused on the legal professional liability market  and an agency largely focused on the professional liability needs of allied healthcare providers 
we continue to see new opportunities from each of the acquisitions and believe each will provide organic growth through expansion in their existing markets and relationships

liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because the holding company has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service and dividends 
at december   we held cash and liquid investments of approximately million outside of our insurance subsidiaries that are available for use without regulatory approval 
our insurance subsidiaries  in aggregate  are permitted to pay dividends of approximately million over the course of without the prior approval of state insurance regulators 
however  the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile and the regulator may prevent the dividend if  in its judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary 
in  our insurance subsidiaries paid dividends of million  of which million was an approved extraordinary dividend 

table of contents shareholder dividends during the board of directors of proassurance instituted a cash dividend policy under which we declared two dividends of per common share  approximately million in total  of which per share  or approximately million in total  was paid in january any decision to pay future cash dividends is subject to the board s final determination after a comprehensive review of financial performance  future expectations and other factors deemed relevant by the board 
the liability for unpaid dividends is included in other liabilities 
acquisitions on november   we acquired of the outstanding shares of aps  a mpl provider principally insuring physicians in the state of texas  in a transaction valued at million including cash paid of million and liabilities assumed of million 
on april  we acquired podiatry insurance company of america and subsidiaries pica through a cash sponsored demutualization as a means of expanding our professional liability insurance operations 
pica provides professional liability insurance primarily to podiatric physicians  chiropractors and other healthcare providers throughout the united states 
we purchased all of pica s outstanding stock created in the demutualization for million in cash  of which million was a surplus contribution to be used to provide renewal premium credits to eligible policyholders over a three year period beginning in in the first quarter of we acquired of the outstanding shares of mid continent general agency  inc  now proassurance mid continent underwriters  inc  mid continent  and georgia lawyers insurance company georgia lawyers  as a means of expanding our professional liability business 
these acquisitions were not material to proassurance individually or in the aggregate 
cash flows the principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise  timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries 

table of contents our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating cash flows for and compare as follows in millions cash flow increase decrease cash provided by operating activities year ended december  increase decrease in operating cash flows during decrease in premium receipts  exclusive of aps increase in payments to reinsurers  exclusive of aps decrease in losses paid  exclusive of aps decrease in reinsurance recoveries  exclusive of aps increase in federal and state income tax payments cash flows attributable to operations acquired from aps exclusive of tax payments or refunds other amounts not individually significant  net cash provided by operating activities year ended december  the decline in premium receipts is primarily attributable to reduced premium volume 
exclusive of two year term policies and the business acquired from aps  gross written premiums were million lower in written premiums associated with two year term policies increased by approximately million in as compared to  however  approximately half of the written amount is not scheduled to be collected until reinsurance contracts are generally for premiums written in a specific annual period  but can remain in effect until all claims under the contract have been resolved 
some contracts require annual settlements while others require settlement only after a number of years have elapsed  thus the amounts paid can vary widely from period to period 
the reduction in paid losses reflects fewer claims closed and lower average payments per claim during the timing of reinsurance recoveries varies from period to period and can depend upon the terms of the applicable reinsurance agreement  the nature of the underlying claim and the timing and amount of underlying loss payments 
the increase in tax payments primarily reflects an increase in estimated tax payments of million during as compared to payments of million made in for the and tax years as a result of federal tax return audits conducted by the internal revenue service 
the payments reduced tax liabilities recognized prior to january  and did not increase or decrease tax expense 
for additional information regarding the internal revenue service audits  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of higher tax payments was partially offset by a million increase in federal tax refunds during principally  refunds from capital loss carry backs were higher in than in and a refund associated with the aps pre acquisition period was received in

we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments  including interest payments  dividends and principal payments  as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
in addition to the interest and dividends we will receive we anticipate that between million and million of our investments will mature or be paid down each quarter of the next year and become available  if needed  to meet our cash flow requirements 
the primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our million credit facility and the fhlb system 
however  given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee any such shortfall 
additional information regarding the credit facility is discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our investment portfolio continues to be primarily composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately of our fixed maturities being investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short term securities is years 
we increased our investment in tax credit limited partnerships by an additional million during these investments are comprised of multiple separate limited partner interests designed to generate investment returns by providing tax benefits to investors in the form of project operating losses and tax credits 
the related properties are principally low income housing properties 
the million carrying value of the partnerships reflects the commitments to the partnerships less amortization of which approximately million is not yet funded as of december  european debt exposure we have no direct european sovereign debt exposure 
we have indirect exposure through our investments in debt securities and through our reinsurance receivables 
issuers of our debt securities and our reinsurers may hold european sovereign debt or have counterparty exposure to european banks or european corporations 
entities that have significant european exposure may suffer credit downgrades due to european sovereign debt exposure or due to european creditor exposure  if they have significant business in the euro zone or eurocurrency denominated business should either or both fail  or should a severe european recession arise

losses the following table  known as the analysis of reserve development  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
as noted in the table  proassurance has completed various acquisitions over the ten year period which have affected original and re estimated gross and net reserve balances as well as loss payments 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of anticipated reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 

table of contents the following may be helpful in understanding the analysis of reserve development the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as reported in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the management and actuarial processes discussed in critical accounting estimates 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve professional liability claims and include the following the mpl legal environment deteriorated in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
we addressed the adverse severity trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
the expectation of increased claim severity was also considered in establishing our initial reserves for subsequent years 
in general  the reserves established at the end of the to calendar years have continued to develop unfavorably due to actual severity trends that proved worse than previously estimated  although we did experience some favorable development relative to these reserves in these adverse severity trends then began to moderate  with that moderation becoming more pronounced in  and we continue to be cautious in giving full recognition to newer indications that the pace of severity increase has slowed  but have given measured recognition of the improving trends in our reserve estimates  as discussed more fully under critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve 
we have recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves primarily for accident years through  giving stronger recognition to a lower severity trend as time elapses and the percentage of closed claims increases 
a general decline in claim frequency has also been a contributor to favorable loss development 
a significant portion of our policies through were issued on an occurrence basis  and a smaller portion of our ongoing business results in occurrence like exposure due to the issuance of extended reporting endorsements 
as claim frequency declined  the number of reported claims related to these coverages was less than originally expected 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below year ended december in thousands balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated gross reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined gross reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability or retirement of an insured who meets certain qualifications 

table of contents reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  the professional liability per claim retention level has varied between and of the first million and between and of claims exceeding those levels depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
we also insure some large professional liability risks that are above the limits of our basic reinsurance treaties 
these risks are reinsured on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our primary reinsurance agreements are negotiated annually at october there was no significant change in the cost or structure of the agreements renewed on october  our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk tolerance and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience with a particular set of claims and our analysis of the potential underwriting results 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
we utilize a reinsurance broker to assist us in the placement of our reinsurance coverage and in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate

table of contents taxes during the fourth quarter of we received a preliminary draft audit report from the irs regarding its audit of our federal income tax return stating that the irs intends to disallow a substantial portion of the loss and loss adjustment expense deduction taken on our return 
the proposed adjustment represents a temporary timing difference and impacts the timing of deductions  rather than their allowance  and would shift tax from deferred to current tax expense but would not increase total tax expense 
as now written  the preliminary draft audit report would require that we reduce our current deduction for loss and loss adjustment expenses  thereby increasing our current tax liability by approximately million including interest associated with the timing of the payment 
for financial reporting purposes  the tax liability asserted in the preliminary draft audit report would be offset  excluding the interest component  by the establishment of a deferred tax asset in recognition that these losses and loss adjustment expenses will be deductible in future periods 
we believe that our loss and loss adjustment expense deduction was computed in a manner consistent with tax law  our past practices  and the practices of other mpl insurers 
we remain in discussions with the irs  challenging the position asserted in the preliminary draft audit report 
there are other taxpayers with legal actions pending against the irs in the united states tax court challenging irs audit findings with regard to loss and loss adjustment expense deductions  and any rulings on these cases may influence the timing and amount of any asserted additional tax liability in any final report we receive from the irs  and in our response to the final report 
any payments made would come out of our cash and investments and could impact future investment earnings  but  except for interest on past due taxes if any  recorded tax expense will not change 
we do not know when a final audit report will be received from the irs  or the amount of additional tax payments or interest that might be asserted

table of contents premiums written changes in our premium volume are driven by four primary factors the amount of new business we generate  including business that comes to pra as a result of acquisitions  the timing of premium written for business generated by multi period policies  our retention of existing business  and the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected both by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase 
the professional liability market remains competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price

table of contents physician premiums our results reflect new physician business of million  including million that is attributable to the acquisition of aps 
new physician business for approximated million  including million attributable to the acquisition of aps 
two year term policies also contributed to the increase in gross written premium 
gross written premium associated with two year term policies is million for  as compared to million for we offer two year term policies as opposed to a one year term to our physician insureds in one selected jurisdiction 
the premium associated with both years is included in written premium in the period the policy is written 
our retention rate for physician business  including business acquired from aps  is for  as compared to for we calculate our retention rate as retained premium divided by all premium subject to renewal 
retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
we may lose insureds to competitors or to self insurance mechanisms often when physicians join hospital based practice groups or due to pricing or other issues 
we may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation 
insureds may also terminate coverage because they have left the practice of medicine for various reasons  principally for retirement but also due to disability or other personal reasons 
charged rates for our renewed physician business  including business acquired from aps  averaged lower than the expiring premiums during our charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we continue to base our rates on expected losses  as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data 
we are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our shareholders 
non physician premiums our healthcare providers included in non physician premiums are primarily dentists  chiropractors  optometrists  and allied health professionals 
the increase is primarily related to allied health coverages 
hospital and facility premiums declined in the decline reflects the same competitive pressures in this area as we are seeing in our physician business 
non physician other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums 
the increase in premium volume in principally relates to legal professional liability premiums 
non continuing premiums consist of premiums derived from certain miscellaneous liability coverages which were discontinued in but that continued to produce small amounts of written premium in tail coverage premiums we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail coverage to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us

there was no significant change in treaty terms between and  and the decrease associated with this reinsurance is largely due to lower premium volume relative to reinsured coverages 
in we entered into a new business relationship with ascension health ascension 
our arrangements with ascension provide that a substantial portion of the initial policies written under the program will be heavily reinsured by an ascension affiliate 
gross premiums written associated with these policies in is approximately million 
the increase in ceded premiums written that is attributable to the aps acquisition primarily reflects eleven additional months of aps activity in during  we commuted terminated certain of our reinsurance arrangements with colisee re formerly axa reassurance sa in return for approximately million in cash 
the commutation reduced ceded premium  on both a written and an earned basis  by million and reduced reinsurance recoveries by approximately million 
premiums ceded in both and were reduced due to the re estimation of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years 
the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years is largely determined based on the losses expected to be recovered under our reinsurance agreements  subject to certain minimums and maximums specific to the reinsurance agreement being adjusted 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses within our reinsured layers of coverage  as well as the related reinsurance recoveries and premiums ceded 
the reductions were more pronounced in approximately million of the reduction is attributable to aps pre acquisition reinsurance contracts

in recent years  largely due to the advantageous legal climate within the state of texas  only a small percentage of aps paid losses have met reinsurance coverage limits  consequently  aps was able to obtain reinsurance coverage for and at favorable rates 
the aps reinsurance arrangements base the amounts due to reinsurers  in part  on expected losses 

table of contents net premiums earned net premiums earned consist of premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  we renew certain policies with a two year term 
tail coverage premiums are generally earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable

our tips portfolio may not continue to outperform in

our tax credit partnerships reduced our tax expenses by approximately million during  while we recognized million of pre tax amortization million after tax on these investments noted in the table above 

table of contents non gaap financial measure tax equivalent investment result we believe that to fully understand our investment returns it is important to consider the current tax benefits associated with certain investments  therefore  we impute a pro forma tax equivalent investment result by adjusting the current tax benefit into the amount of investment income a taxable investment would need to produce to fairly compare to an investment with preferential tax treatment 
we believe this better reflects the economies of our decision to invest in certain asset classes that are either taxed at lower rates and or result in reductions to our current federal income tax expense

the revenue is not a principal source of income and often varies among periods 
during  we recognized other income of million related to a confidential settlement of litigation with a service provider 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to a gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of a building in losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for claims made policies  which represent over of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
for occurrence policies  the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december in millions change change current accident year pra all other aps acquisition consolidated prior accident years pra all other aps acquisition consolidated calendar year pra all other aps acquisition consolidated net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned as compared to  our current accident year net loss ratio reflects a decrease attributable to higher earned premiums resulting from the re estimation of amounts due to reinsurers discussed further under the header premiums  the effect of which was partially offset by a ratio increase attributable to coverages provided to qualified insureds for death  disability and retirement ddr 
we recognized favorable development related to prior accident years of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  detailed information regarding the development recognized is included in the critical accounting estimates section of item  under the caption reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
information provided includes the amount of development recognized by accident year and the factors considered and judgments made to determine the amount of development recognized 

table of contents assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made  as was the case in both and recoveries we recognized favorable prior accident year loss development of approximately million in and million in related to our reinsured coverage layers generally  losses exceeding million and recognized offsetting reductions to loss recoveries of million in and million in because the reduction exceeds all other recoveries for the period  recoveries increase rather than decrease net losses for the year ended december  we similarly reduced our estimates of the premium due to reinsurers by million and million in and  respectively  because the premium due to reinsurers is based in part on amounts recovered

various other expense items reduced operating expense by approximately million 
lower professional fees  principally due to transaction costs incurred in but not in  and an increase in the amount of administrative costs allocated to loss adjustment expense contributed to the decrease 
termination of a captive insurance arrangement  managed by proassurance  increased underwriting expense by million 
there was no similar transaction in lower guaranty fund recoupments in increased expenses by million 
expenses associated with aps include salary and benefit expenses of approximately million in that are related to workforce reductions 
aps policy acquisition expenses are approximately million lower in than would be considered normal due to the application of gaap purchase accounting rules whereby the assets for deferred policy acquisition costs were not recognized as a part of the purchase price allocation of aps 
our expense also includes a million reduction that resulted from a settlement of litigation that is unrelated to our normal insurance activities

expenses of our agency operations that are directly associated with external commission and service fee revenues are included in agency expenses in the above table

other factors affecting our effective tax rate include the following year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income tax credits valuation allowance boli redemption other effective tax rate we continue to invest in tax credit partnerships see equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in we have recognized an expected tax benefit of approximately million related to the credits to be transferred to us by the partnerships 
during we reversed a valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets that were capital in character 
we determined that it was more likely than not that sufficient sources of taxable capital income would be available in future periods to allow us to fully utilize the deferred tax assets 
a partial redemption of our boli increased tax expense in by approximately million  there were no boli redemptions during although our effective tax rate is consistent between and  current tax expense increased by approximately million in in we recorded a current liability of million including interest of million for unrecognized tax benefits

results from the years ended december  and compare as follows premiums net premiums earned increased during by approximately million or 
three additional months of pica earned premium and one month of aps earned premium generated approximately million of additional net earned premium 
net earned premium was increased by an additional million related to the re estimation of amounts due to reinsurers related to prior accident years 
these increases were partially offset by other declines in earned premium principally due to non renewals and rate reductions 
net investment income  net realized investment gains losses our net investment result which includes both net investment income and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased by million or primarily due to a decrease in earnings from fixed income securities and short term investments 
the decrease primarily reflects lower yields in net realized investment gains increased by million during as compared to  increased gains from sales more than offset a million increase in impairment losses 
expenses net losses decreased by million or during due to increased prior year favorable loss development of million offset by a million increase in current accident year losses 
the increase in current accident year losses is primarily attributable to three additional months of pica activity in and one additional month of aps activity 
underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses increased in by million or 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to the acquisitions of pica and aps and the remainder relates to various operating factors 
ratios our net loss ratio decreased in by percentage points 
higher prior year favorable development decreased the ratio by percentage points 
our underwriting expense ratio increased in by percentage points 
the increase is attributable both to the acquisitions of pica and aps and increased policy acquisition and operating costs 
our operating ratio increased in by percentage point reflecting a decline in the investment ratio of approximately percentage points partially offset by the combined percentage point decrease in the net loss and expense ratios 
return on equity is for and for book value per share our book value per share at december  is compared to at december  the change reflects our income  the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and a benefit from treasury share purchases 
due to the size of our shareholders equity approximately billion at december   the growth rate of our book value per share may slow 
the past growth rates of our book value per share do not necessarily predict similar future results 

table of contents non gaap financial measures operating income is a non gaap financial measure that is widely used to evaluate the performance of insurance entities 
operating income excludes the after tax effects of realized gains or losses  guaranty fund assessments and debt retirement loss 
we believe operating income presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations  but should be considered in conjunction with net income computed in accordance with gaap

as required by gaap  our results include acquired entities only for the portion of the reporting period that is after the acquisition date 
our operating results include twelve months of pica activity see following paragraph and one month of aps activity 
our operating results include nine months of pica activity but do not include any aps results 
in many of the supporting tables that follow  the effect of the additional pica aps activity is shown separately with the column header additional pica aps activity

discussions that follow present paco and pica results on a combined basis in order to be consistent with the presentation for the combined results are referred to as pica 

table of contents premiums gross premiums written changes in our premium volume are driven by three primary factors our retention of existing business  the amount of new business we are able to generate  including business that comes to pra as a result of acquisitions  and the premium charged for business that is renewed  which is affected both by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase 
the professional liability market remains competitive with some competitors choosing to compete primarily on price 
gross premiums written by component are as follows change in thousands additional pica aps activity other total physician non physician healthcare providers hospital and facility other non continuing tail coverage premiums gross premiums written  total excludes tail coverage premiums pica million aps million pica million physician premiums physician premiums continue to be our primary revenue source and comprise and of our gross premiums written in and  respectively 
approximately million of the overall decrease in physician premiums is due to changes in our renewal patterns 
we began offering policy renewals for a two year term as opposed to a one year term to our physician insureds in one selected jurisdiction during late the premium associated with both policy terms is included in written premium in the period the policy is written  which increases gross written premium in the year the policy is written but reduces gross written premium in the following year 
approximately million of the gross written premium decline during is attributable to the policies written on a two year term 
also  during  in order to more evenly distribute renewals throughout the year  we offered early renewal to a number of insureds who otherwise would have had a first quarter renewal date 
approximately million of the decrease in physician premiums is attributable to the shift in renewal dates 
excluding aps  our retention rate for our physician business for is  which is unchanged from retention rates are affected by a number of factors 
we may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation 
insureds terminate coverage because they have retired or have otherwise ceased to practice medicine 
we may also lose insureds to competitors or to self insurance mechanisms often when physicians join hospital based practice groups due to pricing or other issues 
in the aggregate  charged rates for our physician business renewed in showed no change 
in charged rates showed an average decrease 
in general  charged rates at our pica subsidiary increased in as compared to  while rates at our other insurance subsidiaries decreased 
our 
table of contents charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
despite competitive pressures  we continue to base our rates on expected losses  as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data 
we are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while generating competitive returns for our shareholders 
we wrote approximately million of new physician business during non physician premiums our non physician healthcare providers are primarily dentists  chiropractors  optometrists  and allied health professionals 
the increase is primarily related to allied health coverages  but also includes additional premium of million generated by a targeted marketing campaign to optometrists 
hospital and facility premiums decreased during the decline reflects many of the same competitive pressures that are affecting our business overall 
non physician other premiums are primarily legal professional liability premiums  but also includes other types of general liability premiums 
the million increase in premium volume for principally relates to our legal professional liability premiums 
non continuing in the above table separately identifies premium generated by certain types of miscellaneous liability coverages which we no longer provide 
we do expect minimal premiums from these coverages in future periods 
tail coverage premiums we separately report tail coverage premiums because we offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us 
the amount of tail coverage premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 

table of contents premiums earned ceded change in thousands additional pica aps activity other total premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned includes million attributable to aps  substantially all of which relates to policies written prior to our acquisition of aps 
premiums earned because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
generally  our policies carry a term of one year  but as discussed above  we renew certain policies with a two year term 
tail coverage premiums are generally earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
the acquisition of aps is expected to increase earned premium by million related to aps premiums written prior to the acquisition that were unearned at december  the premiums will be earned in on a pro rata basis  and are expected to affect premiums earned as follows q million  q million  q million  q million 
premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 
premiums ceded declined in both and million and million  respectively due to reductions in the estimated amounts expected to be due to reinsurers related to prior year coverages 
these reductions had a significant effect on our reinsurance expense ratio as shown in the following table 
year ended december change reinsurance expense ratio before changes to prior accident years effect of estimate changes to prior accident years reinsurance expense ratio  calendar year excluding the effect of the changes to prior year estimates  the decrease in the reinsurance expense is primarily due to shifts in the mix of our business during as compared to in we discontinued offering certain non physician liability policies see discussion under premiums  and reduced our reinsurance coverage related to the policies 
also  premiums earned from our legal professional liability business acquired from georgia lawyers were more heavily reinsured in than in pre acquisition reinsurance agreements were in effect in but proassurance reinsurance agreements with higher retention limits were in effect in

while we expect this investment to provide a positive return over time  we anticipate operating losses during the start up phase  expected to last another twelve months 
our potential for loss is limited to the carrying amount of our investment  currently million 
we began investing in tax credit limited partnerships in our tax credit investments are designed to generate investment returns by providing tax benefits to fund investors in the form of net operating losses and tax credits 
during our tax credit partnerships generated a tax benefit of approximately million 
tax equivalent investment result we believe that to fully understand our investment returns it is important to consider the tax benefits associated with certain investments  therefore  we impute a tax equivalent investment result in order to better reflect the economies of our decision to invest in certain asset classes that are either taxed at lower rates and or result in reductions to our federal income tax expense

the securities were returned to our direct ownership in when our interest in a private investment fund was liquidated 
based on our intent to sell the securities  we have recognized all declines in fair value below our cost basis as other than temporary impairments 
we recognized an impairment of million in related to an interest in a private investment fund which we account for on a cost basis 
the fund has reported realized losses on the sale of securities  and we have reduced the carrying value of our interest in the fund in recognition of our pro rata share of those losses 
we recognized impairments in earnings of million in  including million reclassified from oci  related to residential mortgage backed securities 
expected future cash flows were less than our carrying value for these securities  therefore  we reduced the carrying value of our interest in these securities and recognized the loss in our net income 
fair value adjustments are attributable to our election of fair value treatment for both the note payable and related interest rate swap  as discussed in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for claims made policies  which represent over of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer  for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 

table of contents the following tables summarize calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
net losses year ended december net loss ratios in millions total change year ended december change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
the increase in current accident year losses for is primarily attributable to three additional months of pica activity and one month of aps activity 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized favorable loss development of million and million respectively  on a net basis  related to reserves established in prior years 
the principal components of development are as follows year ended december in millions reserve development by accident year  favorable unfavorable accident years accident years accident years accident years prior to net favorable development recognized substantially all of the favorable development recognized during and relates to mpl claims made reserves 
the favorable development for medical professional claims made policies in both years is based upon observation of actual claims data that indicates that claims severity ie  the expected average cost of claims is trending below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of final claim settlement values  we are generally cautious in giving credence to the trends that lead to the recognition of favorable net loss development 
as we conclude that sufficient credible data with respect to these trends exists we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining attentive to the past volatility of claims severity 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made  as has been the case in and 
table of contents underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses the table below provides a comparison of our and underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses change related to pica aps transactions total in thousands other insurance operation expenses  total agency related expenses expense increase related to pica aps excluding agency related expenses approximately million of the increase in underwriting  policy acquisition and operating expenses are attributable to the pica and aps transactions  as detailed below in thousands one month of aps activity in three additional months of pica activity in aps transaction and closing costs expensed in pica transaction and closing costs expensed in increased pica policy acquisition costs in in we incurred million in transaction related costs associated with the purchase of pica  principally for severance costs and investment banking fees 
similarly  we incurred million in transaction related costs primarily in the third and fourth quarters of associated with the purchase of aps 
the increase in policy acquisition expenses reflects the application of gaap purchase accounting rules whereby the capitalized policy acquisition costs for policies written prior to the acquisition date are written off rather than being expensed ratably over the term of the associated insurance policy 
application of this guidance resulted in lower than normal pica acquisition costs in similarly  aps acquisition expenses for the one month included in our results for are lower than what would be considered normal and will increase gradually in as more aps earned premium is generated by policies written after the acquisition date 

table of contents other expense increase the remaining million increase in insurance operation expenses is primarily due to the following expense for policy acquisition costs was higher in primarily because premium earned related to allied healthcare  legal and miscellaneous professional liability coverages increased in commission and underwriting expenses associated with these premiums are higher than those associated with physician premiums 
we recognized million in ceding commission expense related to a captive insurance arrangement that was terminated in we allocate our operating costs between insurance operations expense and loss adjustment expenses 
the amount allocated to loss adjustment expense decreased by million in  which had the effect of increasing operating expenses 
guaranty fund assessments or recoupments are not controlled by us  but do affect our results 
in both and recoupments exceeded assessments  but the recoupment benefit was million greater in we terminated and replaced our employee stock ownership plan during the year  resulting in an acceleration of vesting of participants accounts 
this resulted in a charge of approximately million during the year 
the new plan put in place provides for vesting of benefits over a three year period and will result in lower operating expenses  as compared to the prior plan over the next three years 
we entered into a deferred compensation agreement with one of our senior executives resulting in the recognition of a million expense during the fourth quarter 
agency related expenses we operate several fee based agencies and provide benefit management services on a limited basis 
their business activities generate commission and service fee revenues which are reported as a part of other income 
we have excluded the direct expenses of these entities from our underwriting expense ratio computations because their activities and business operations are not associated with the generation of premium revenues 
during the latter part of we discontinued certain agency activities which reduced expenses as compared to underwriting expense ratio underwriting expense ratio year ended december change insurance operation expenses our expense ratio computations exclude agency related expenses as discussed above 
the increase in our underwriting expense ratio reflects the net increase to expenses of  discussed in the above paragraphs  mitigated by an increase to net earned premiums of 

table of contents interest expense the decrease in interest expense reflects a decline in average rates on our variable debt of approximately basis points against an increase in average outstanding debt principal of approximately million during as compared to interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table year ended december in thousands change trust preferred debentures due surplus notes due may note payable due february note payable due february surplus notes due may other converted from a fixed to a variable rate in may debt acquired in the pica transaction debt acquired in the pica transaction  redeemed august taxes our effective tax rate for each period is lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt 
other factors affecting our effective tax rate include the following year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income tax credits valuation allowance boli redemption other effective tax rate we have invested in tax credit partnerships during see capital and liquidity investment exposures and equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in we have recognized an expected tax benefit of approximately million related to the credits to be transferred to us by the partnerships 
during we reversed a valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets that were capital in character 
we determined that it has become more likely than not that sufficient sources of taxable capital income will be available in future periods to allow us to fully utilize the deferred tax assets 
we recognized additional tax of million on the redemption of a portion of our boli investment as discussed in capital and liquidity investment exposures 
increases in the cash surrender value on boli policies are not taxable unless redeemed 
upon redemption  the difference in the proceeds from redemption and premiums previously paid on the policies redeemed become taxable 
in this instance  the difference approximated million 

table of contents income tax expense is provided in the following table year ended december change provision for income taxes current expense benefit deferred expense benefit total income tax expense benefit although our effective tax rate is consistent between and  current tax expense increased by approximately million in in we received a current tax benefit from the sale of impaired securities that was million greater than the benefit received in additionally  in we received a benefit of million related to the settlement of the chw judgment 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell any of the debt securities held in an unrealized loss position before its anticipated recovery 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates by asset class at december  there are principally two factors that determine interest rates on a given security market interest rates and credit spreads 
as different asset classes can be affected in different ways by movements in those two factors  we have broken out our portfolio by asset class in the following table 
december  interest rate shift in basis points current fair value in millions us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities december  fair value in millions us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities duration us treasury obligations us agency obligations state and municipal bonds corporate debt asset backed securities all fixed maturity securities 
table of contents interest rate risk continued computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  is on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  such as am best  fitch  moody s  and standard poor s 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  investment grade securities  in spite of their rating  can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
ratings published by the nrsros are one of the tools used to evaluate the credit worthiness of our securities 
the ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the credit worthiness of the securities  and therefore  we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the rating prove to be unreliable
