overview we are a principal investment firm primarily focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market lmm companies  which we generally define as companies with annual revenues between million and million that operate in diverse industries 
we invest primarily in secured debt instruments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lmm companies based in the united states 
our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments  including warrants  convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company 
our lmm portfolio investments generally range in size from million to million 
we seek to fill the current financing gap for lmm businesses  which  historically  have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources 
the underserved nature of the lower middle market creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lmm companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations 
our ability to invest across a company s capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing solutions  or one stop financing 
providing customized  one stop financing solutions has become even more relevant to our lmm portfolio companies in the current investing environment 
we generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs  management teams and business owners in making our investments 
we believe that our lmm investment strategy has a lower correlation to the broader debt and equity markets 
as of december   we had debt and equity investments in lmm portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of million  with a total cost basis of approximately million  and a weighted average annual effective yield on our lmm debt investments of approximately 
approximately of our total lmm portfolio investments at cost were in the form of debt investments and of such debt investments at cost were secured by first priority liens on the assets of our lmm portfolio companies as of december  at december   we had equity ownership in approximately of our lmm portfolio companies and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was approximately 
as of december   we had debt and equity investments in lmm portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of million with a total cost basis of approximately million and a weighted average annual effective yield on our lmm debt investments of approximately 
the weighted average annual yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at december  and  including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding liquidation fees payable upon repayment and any debt investments on non accrual status 
in addition to our lmm investment strategy  we opportunistically pursue investments in privately placed debt securities 
our private placement portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our lmm portfolio 
our privately placed portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the company and have an expected duration of between three and four years 
as of december   we had privately placed portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in fair value with a total cost basis of approximately million 
the weighted average revenues for the privately placed portfolio company investments were approximately million as of december  our privately placed portfolio investments are primarily in the form of debt investments and of such debt investments at cost were secured by first priority liens on portfolio

our portfolio investments are generally made through mscc and the funds 
mscc and the funds share the same investment strategies and criteria  although they are subject to different regulatory regimes 
an investor s return in mscc will depend  in part  on the funds investment returns as msmf is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc and msc ii is a majority owned subsidiary of mscc 
the level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals  our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria  and our ability to consummate the identified opportunities 
the level of new investment activity  and associated interest and fee income  will directly impact future investment income 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non accrual status will directly impact future investment income 
while we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term  our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods 
however  we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook 
the level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also fluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies 
the changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results 
during  we paid dividends on a monthly basis totaling per share  or million 
we generated undistributed taxable income or spillover income of approximately million  or per share  during that will be carried forward toward distributions paid in in december  we declared monthly dividends for the first quarter of totaling per share  representing an increase compared to the monthly dividends for the first quarter of in march  we declared monthly dividends for the second quarter of totaling per share  representing a increase compared to the monthly dividends for the second quarter of during  we paid monthly dividends of per share  or per share for the entire year 
including the dividends declared for the first and second quarters of  we will have paid approximately per share in cumulative dividends since our october initial public offering 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities and idle funds investments 
in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our credit facility the credit facility  from million to million to provide additional liquidity in support of future investment and operational activities 
the million increase in total commitments included commitment increases by lenders currently participating in the credit facility  as well as the addition of two new lender relationships which further diversified our lending group to a total of eight participants 
in october  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters full exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs

a proposed bill in the us house of representatives  the small business investment company modernization act of  or house bill  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds from million to million 
another bill in the us senate  senate bill  to increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds to million was recently introduced in the us senate and referred to the committee on small business and entrepreneurship 
if either of these bills is enacted  main street s sbic leverage capacity through the funds would increase by an additional million 
while main street is positioned to benefit from the full passage of either bill  the ultimate form and likely outcome of such legislation or any similar legislation cannot be predicted 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
for the years ended december  and  our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mscc and its consolidated subsidiaries  including the funds 
portfolio investments  as used herein  refers to all of our portfolio investments in lmm companies  private placement portfolio investments  and our investment in the investment manager but excludes all of our marketable securities and idle funds investments 
marketable securities and idle funds investments are classified as financial instruments and are reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedule of investments due to the nature of such investments 
our results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december    and  and financial position as of december  and  are presented on a consolidated basis 
the effects of all intercompany transactions between main street and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform with the current financial statement presentation 
under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the audit and accounting guide for investment companies issued by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa guide  we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments  including those in which we have a controlling interest  unless the portfolio company is another investment company 
an exception to this general principle in the aicpa guide occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us  or to an investment company of ours 
none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception 
therefore  our portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as discussed further in note b to our consolidated financial statements  with any adjustments to fair value recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on our statement of operations until the investment is exited  resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a net realized gain loss from investments 
portfolio investment valuation the most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our portfolio investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value including our investment in the investment manager 
we are required to report our investments at fair value 
we follow the provisions of the accounting standards codification codification or asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value  and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
our portfolio strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid securities issued by private  lmm companies as well as privately placed debt securities issued by middle market companies that are 
table of contents generally larger in size than the lmm companies 
these portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale 
lmm companies generally have no established trading market while privately placed debt securities generally have established markets that are not active 
we determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with asc and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the act 
for lmm investments  we review external events  including private mergers  sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies  and include these events in the valuation process 
for private placement portfolio investments  we generally use observable inputs such as quoted prices in the valuation process 
our valuation policy and process is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 
for valuation purposes  control investments are composed of equity and debt securities for which we have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or have the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for our control investments 
as a result  we determine the fair value of control investments using a combination of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we will typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of these investments 
the enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties  other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
typically  private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
there is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value 
for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results 
we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the investments 
we will also use the income approach to determine the fair value of these securities  based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the portfolio company or the debt security will likely generate 
the valuation approaches for our control investments estimate the value of the investment if we were to sell  or exit  the investment 
in addition  these valuation approaches consider the value associated with our ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 
for valuation purposes  non control lmm investments are composed of debt and equity securities for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations for non control lmm investments are generally not readily available 
for our non control lmm investments  we use a combination of the market and income approaches to value our equity investments and the income approach to value our debt instruments 
for non control lmm debt investments  we determine the fair value primarily using a yield approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our estimate of the expected repayment date of an lmm debt security is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold our loans to maturity 
the yield analysis considers changes in leverage levels  credit quality  portfolio company performance and other factors 
we will use the value determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security  however  because of our general intent to hold our loans to maturity  the fair value will not exceed the face amount of the lmm debt security 
a change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our lmm debt securities using the yield analysis could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
if there is deterioration in credit quality or if an lmm debt security is in workout status  we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the lmm debt security  including the value attributable to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis 
our private placement portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our investment portfolio 
for valuation purposes  all of our private placement portfolio investments are non control investments and are composed of debt securities for which we do not have a controlling interest 
table of contents in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
we primarily use observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third party quotes or independent pricing 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our determination of fair value for our lmm investments may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment  portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned 
we determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income we record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
in accordance with our valuation policy  we evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
if a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding the debtor s ability to service the debt or other obligations  or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired  sold or written off  we will remove it from non accrual status 
fee income we may periodically provide services  including structuring and advisory services  to our portfolio companies 
for services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned  which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes 
fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are accreted into interest income over the life of the financing 
payment in kind pik interest and cumulative dividends we hold debt and preferred equity instruments in our investment portfolio that contain payment in kind pik interest and cumulative dividend provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement  is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income 
thus  the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income  and any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment 
the actual collection of dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed 
to maintain ric tax treatment as discussed below  these non cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we may not have collected the pik interest and cumulative dividends in cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and cumulative dividends and will write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when it is determined that such pik interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plans using the fair value method  as prescribed by asc  compensation stock compensation 
accordingly  for restricted stock awards  we measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and will amortize this fair value to share based compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 

table of contents income taxes mscc has elected to be  and intends to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to  a ric under the code  and  among other things  intends to make the required distributions to its stockholders as specified therein 
in order to qualify as a ric  mscc is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  each year 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  mscc may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income 
any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such taxable income 
the taxable subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments of main street 
the taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for us gaap reporting purposes  and the portfolio investments held by them are included in main street s consolidated financial statements 
the taxable subsidiaries permit main street to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes in order to comply with the source income requirements contained in the ric tax provisions 
the taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with main street for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense  or benefit  as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments 
this income tax expense  or benefit  is reflected in main street s consolidated statement of operations 
the taxable subsidiaries use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses 
taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
portfolio investment composition lmm portfolio investments principally consist of secured debt  equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held  lmm companies 
the lmm debt investments are secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally bear interest at fixed rates  and generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment date 
in most lmm portfolio companies  we also receive nominally priced equity warrants and or make direct equity investments  usually in connection with a debt investment 
private placement portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our lmm portfolio 
our privately placed portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien

table of contents portfolio asset quality we utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each portfolio company 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that  in general  is performing above expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is underperforming expectations 
investments with such a rating require increased monitoring and scrutiny by us 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is significantly underperforming 
investments with such a rating require heightened levels of monitoring and scrutiny by us and involve the recognition of significant unrealized depreciation on such investment 
all new portfolio investments receive an initial rating

the broader fundamentals of the united states economy remain mixed  and unemployment remains elevated 
in the event that the united states economy contracts  it is likely that the financial results of small to mid sized companies  like those in which we invest  could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
consequently  we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic cycles or other conditions  which could also have a negative impact on our future results

main street believes presenting distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income  and related per share amounts  is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure of information for analyzing its financial performance since share based compensation does not require settlement in cash 
however  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income are non gaap measures and should not be considered as a replacement to net investment income  net realized income  and other earnings measures presented in accordance with gaap 
instead  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income should be reviewed only in connection with such gaap measures in analyzing main street s financial performance

table of contents investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  a million  or  increase over the million of total investment income for the corresponding period of this comparable period increase was principally attributable to i a million increase in interest income from higher average levels of both portfolio debt investments and interest bearing marketable securities investments  ii a million increase in dividend income from portfolio equity investments  and iii a million increase in fee income due to higher levels of transaction activity 
the increase in investment income included a million increase in investment income associated with higher levels of accelerated prepayment and repricing activity for certain debt investments 
expenses for the year ended december   total expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million from million for the corresponding period of this comparable period increase in expenses was principally attributable to i higher interest expense of million as a result of the issuance of an additional million in sbic debentures subsequent to december   and increased borrowing activity under the credit facility  ii higher share based compensation expense of million related to non cash amortization for restricted share grants  and iii higher compensation and other operating expenses of million related to the significant increase in investment income and portfolio investments compared to the corresponding period of the ratio of total operating expenses  excluding interest expense  as a percentage of average total assets for the year ended december  was  representing an approximate decrease from the same ratio of for the year ended december  distributable net investment income distributable net investment income for the year ended december  increased to million  or per share  compared with distributable net investment income of million  or per share  for the corresponding period of the increase in distributable net investment income was primarily due to the higher level of total investment income partially offset by higher interest and other operating expenses  due to the changes discussed above 
distributable net investment income on a per share basis for the year ended reflects approximately per share of investment income associated with higher levels of accelerated prepayment and repricing activity for certain debt investments and ii a greater number of average shares outstanding compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to the october  march  and august follow on stock offerings 
net investment income net investment income for the year ended december  was million  or a increase  compared to net investment income of million for the corresponding period of the increase in net investment income was principally attributable to the increase in total investment income partially offset by higher interest and other operating expenses as discussed above 
distributable net realized income distributable net realized income increased to million  or per share  for the year ended compared with distributable net realized income of million  or per share  for the corresponding period of the increase was primarily attributable to the higher level of distributable net investment income as well as the higher level of total net realized gain from investments in compared to the net realized loss from investments in the corresponding period of the million net realized gain during was primarily attributable to i realized gain recognized on one partial exit of an lmm portfolio company equity investment  ii realized gain recognized on one full exit of an lmm portfolio company equity investment  and iii realized gains related to privately placed and marketable securities investments

main street believes presenting distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income  and related per share amounts  is useful and appropriate supplemental disclosure of information for analyzing its financial performance since share based compensation does not require settlement in cash 
however  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income are non gaap measures and should not be considered as a replacement to net investment income  net realized income  and other earnings measures presented in accordance with gaap 
instead  distributable net investment income and distributable net realized income should be reviewed only in connection with such gaap measures in analyzing main street s financial performance

table of contents capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities  and idle funds investments 
as of december   our net asset value totaled million  or per share 
in november  we expanded the credit facility from million to million to provide additional liquidity in support of future investment and operational activities 
the million increase in total commitments included commitment increases by lenders currently participating in the credit facility  as well as the addition of one new lender relationship which diversified our lending group to a total of seven participants 
in december  we further expanded the credit facility from million to million 
the million increase in total commitments included the addition of one new lender relationship which further diversifies our lending group to a total of eight participants 
the recent increases in total commitments were executed under the accordion feature of the credit facility which allows us to increase the total commitments under the facility up to million of total commitments from new or existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  subject to our election  on a per annum basis equal to i the applicable libor rate plus or ii the applicable base rate plus 
we pay unused commitment fees of per annum on the average unused lender commitments under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a first lien on the assets of mscc and its subsidiaries  excluding the assets of the funds 
the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to i maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least to  ii maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least to  and iii maintaining a minimum tangible net worth 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  bearing interest at an interest rate of 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit facility 
in october  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters full exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
in march  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters full exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share or approximately of the then latest reported net asset value per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
due to each of the funds status as a licensed sbic  we have the ability to issue  through the funds  debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the regulations applicable to sbic funds  an sbic can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which effectively approximates the amount of its equity capital 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing year treasury note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 
debentures issued prior to september were subject to pre payment penalties during their first five years 
those pre payment penalties no longer apply to debentures issued after september  on december   we  through the funds  had million of outstanding indebtedness guaranteed by the sba  which carried a weighted average annual fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first maturity related to the sbic debentures does not occur until  and the remaining weighted average duration is approximately years as of december  the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the funds 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the funds 

table of contents a proposed bill in the us house of representatives  the small business investment company modernization act of  or house bill  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds from million to million 
another bill in the us senate  senate bill  to increase the total sbic leverage capacity for affiliated sbic funds to million  was recently introduced in the us senate and referred to the committee on small business and entrepreneurship 
if either of these bills is enacted  main street s sbic leverage capacity through the funds would increase by an additional million 
while main street is positioned to benefit from the full passage of either bill  the ultimate form and likely outcome of such legislation or any similar legislation cannot be predicted 
we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents  the liquidation of marketable securities and idle funds investments  and a combination of future debt and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
we periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and idle funds investments 
the primary investment objective of marketable securities and idle funds investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our lmm and private placement portfolio investment strategy 
marketable securities and idle funds investments generally consist of debt investments  independently rated debt investments  certificates of deposit with financial institutions  and diversified bond funds 
the composition of marketable securities and idle funds investments will vary in a given period based upon  among other things  changes in market conditions  the underlying fundamentals in our marketable securities and idle funds investments  our outlook regarding future lmm and private placement portfolio investment needs  and any regulatory requirements applicable to main street 
if our common stock trades below our net asset value per share  we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
a proposal  approved by our stockholders at our june annual meeting of stockholders  authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a period of one year ending on june  we would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval 
we are seeking such approval for the next year at our annual stockholders meeting to be held on june  in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
in january  we received an exemptive order from the sec to exclude sba guaranteed debt securities issued by msmf and any other wholly owned subsidiaries of ours which operate as sbics from the asset coverage requirements of the act as applicable to main street  which  in turn  enables us to fund more investments with debt capital 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including recent public stock offerings  our expanded million credit facility  and the increase in available leverage through the sbic program as part of the stimulus bill  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments  marketable securities  and idle funds investments 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent of any debt investments that include floating interest rates 
the majority of our debt investments are made with fixed interest rates for the term of the investment 
however  as of december   approximately of our debt investment portfolio at cost bore interest at floating rates with of those floating rate debt investments at cost subject to contractual minimum interest rates 
in addition  as of december   approximately of our marketable securities debt investments at cost bore interest at floating rates with of those floating rate debt investments at cost subject to contractual minimum interest rates
