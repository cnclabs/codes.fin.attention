item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the two years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing  semiconductor dram and flash memory manufacturing  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we sell products in these markets both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards  solar cells and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been cyclical  and have experienced periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
our results were favorably impacted in and as the worldwide demand for cell phones  smart phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules  and thereby increasing demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
after peaking in the third quarter of  our revenue declined sequentially each quarter through the first quarter of  as our results were negatively impacted by reduced levels of capital spending for electronics manufacturing capacity brought about by the deepening weakness in the global economy 
new orders dropped off sharply late in the fourth quarter of as the global economy fell into a severe recession  and our results for were adversely affected by the ongoing weakness in the global electronics market 
the global electronics market strengthened significantly in our sales benefited in as pent up demand  an improving economy  coupled with new product introductions led to significantly increased sales of alignment sensors and our stand alone solder paste inspection spi and automated optical inspection aoi systems 
our results in have been driven by strong sales of our stand alone inspection system products  particularly our new family of qx aoi system products 
sales of aoi systems climbed over to a record million from million in our qx sales were paced by substantial orders from several of the industry s largest original design manufacturers odms in asia  who deployed this new generation technology on both new and existing production lines 
reflecting the strong sales of our aoi technologies  cyberoptics total inspection system revenues hit a new record of million in we posted lower sales of smt alignment sensors in due largely to the general weakening in overall economic conditions 
sales of solar wafer alignment cameras for the photovoltaic cell market were particularly soft in the latter half of  reflecting the continued impact of aggressive production capacity expansion in the solar market during and early partly offsetting weakness in sales of smt alignment sensors were additional sales of se sensors to german based viscom ag  which has integrated cyberoptics sensor technology into its spi platforms 
we believe that the first quarter of will be challenging for the electronics assembly  semiconductor and solar markets 
although we expect that our system sales may grow in the first quarter of fiscal compared to sales in l  we expect that sales of smt sensors will remain soft  while sales of solar sensors  which accounted for million of revenue in the first quarter of  will be virtually nil 
we ended with an order backlog of million  compared to million at the end of the third quarter 
given these factors  we anticipate earnings at or slightly above break even in the first quarter ending march  we believe our performance will strengthen as the year progresses  reflecting what we believe will be continued demand for inspection systems  the introduction of new products  and a rebound in sales of solar sensors later in the year 
the second and third quarters also tend to mark the peak buying periods for asian odm customers 
as a result  we are forecasting moderately improved sales and earnings for full year fiscal in all  we believe our strategic emphasis on inspection systems and initiatives aimed at broadening our market reach will enable cyberoptics to report another growth year in our current markets are cyclical 
to a certain extent  our future growth is dependent on our ability to gain share in our current markets and to identify  focus on and achieve success in new markets 
nevertheless  our ability to achieve our forecast and to implement our strategy effectively is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks  including the risks identified in item a of this annual report on form k 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 

table of contents segment results our business consists of two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments 
in the electronic assembly segment we design  manufacture and sell optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly and photovoltaic solar cell equipment markets 
in the semiconductor segment we design  manufacture and sell optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly    semiconductor    total    gross margin electronic assembly    semiconductor    total    operating expense electronic assembly    semiconductor    total    income loss from operations electronic assembly    semiconductor   total income loss from operations    interest income and other income loss before income taxes    revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly alignment sensors    smt inspection systems    total electronic assembly    semiconductor    total    electronic assembly revenue from sales of alignment sensors decreased by million or in  down from million in revenue from sales of our smt inspection system products increased by million or in  up from million in revenue from sales of our alignment sensors increased by to million in  up from million in revenue from sales of our stand alone smt inspection system products increased by or million to million in  up from million in 
table of contents sales of non solar smt alignment sensors decreased by million or to million in  resulting largely from the general weakening in overall economic conditions and a challenging comparison with  when sales of capital equipment for printed circuit board production benefited from pent up demand as the global economy was emerging from the deep recession of sales of solar wafer alignment cameras for the photovoltaic cell market  while up  or in to million  were particularly soft in the last six months of  reflecting the continued impact of aggressive production capacity expansion in the solar market during and early in march  we entered into an oem agreement with german based viscom ag  under which we integrated our se sensor technology into viscom s spi platforms 
we realized the initial sales of our se spi sensors to viscom ag in the second quarter of we believe viscom s new platform has enjoyed a strong market acceptance  resulting in additional orders for our se sensors that we anticipate will increase in future periods 
this new oem partnership has the potential to make a significant contribution to our profitability over the next few years 
revenue from sales of our stand alone smt inspection system products increased by million or in  up from million in the revenue increase was driven by favorable market acceptance and significantly higher sales of our family of qx aoi system products 
sales of aoi systems climbed over to a record million from million in our qx sales were paced by substantial orders from several of the industry s largest odms in asia  who deployed this new generation technology on both new and existing production lines 
featuring what we believe are the fastest aoi inspection times currently available  the qx family is based upon a cost reduced platform that we believe exceeds the performance metrics of competitors systems 
we believe the qx family of products will continue to receive favorable market acceptance  particularly with odms  where we have a large  established installed base of spi systems and where the fast inspection times of the qx are required 
increased sales of aoi systems in were offset slightly by a small reduction in sales of our spi systems 
sales of spi systems declined by  or to million in  from million in we believe that the ongoing introduction of new system products addressing different tiers of the market will strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
for example  we have recently introduced two new inspection system products a lower end aoi tabletop system and a higher performance spi system based upon a newly developed dual illumination sensor 
the global recession caused severe weakness and disruption in our electronics markets starting late in and throughout all of  resulting in very low levels of revenue in from both our alignment sensors and stand alone smt inspection system products 
the global electronics market strengthened in  returning to more normalized levels of equipment purchases and production capacity additions 
we believe that improved market conditions  combined with favorable market acceptance of the new products we have recently introduced  resulted in the higher revenue levels in compared to the same periods of our revenue in benefited from initial shipment of solar wafer alignment cameras to dek  an equipment manufacturer for the photovoltaic cell market 
sales of our se  se and se ultra spi systems increased by over to million in from million in our sales of qx and flex ultra aoi system products increased by to million in  up from million in sales of our inspection system products were negatively impacted in by the severe global economic recession 
we believe that ongoing introduction of new system products will continue to strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
unlike revenue from our alignment sensors  which is closely tied to the need for added production capacity for printed circuit boards  a portion of our stand alone smt systems revenue is derived from the retro fit of existing production lines as companies seek to improve their production yields  thereby reducing manufacturing costs 
we believe that these new products  and technology trends toward smaller components and increased production speeds  will contribute to increased demand and higher revenue in export revenue from alignment and oem inspection sensors and stand alone smt inspection systems totaled million or of electronic assembly revenue in  compared to million or of electronic assembly revenue in sales to international customers continue to be significant  as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
semiconductor revenues from sales of our semiconductor products increased by or million to million in revenues from sales of semiconductor products increased by or million to million in  up from million in the revenue increase in both years was due to continuing favorable market acceptance of our wafersense products 
sales of these products increased by million or to million in wafersense revenue increased by over to million in  from million in the increase in revenue in was also due to improving conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment resulting from the better economic environment 

table of contents our wafer mapper and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our wafersense products  a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we expect to introduce a new wafersense particle sensor in  and anticipate introducing additional wafersense products in later periods 
export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in we anticipate that the percentage of export revenue will continue to grow in the future as a higher proportion of our wafersense sales come from international customers compared to our other semiconductor products 
cost of revenue and gross margin electronic assembly cost of revenue for our electronic assembly segment increased by  or to million in  after increasing by to million in the increase in cost of revenue in both periods was due to the higher level of sales 
electronic assembly sales increased in and in cost of revenue items fluctuating with the level of sales include raw materials  direct labor and some factory overhead costs 
gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales was in  compared to in the improvement in gross margin percentage in  compared to  was due to increased sales of higher margin products  including the large increase in sales of our qx family of aoi systems and se sensors to viscom  as well as the favorable impact of cost reduction programs across all of our electronic assembly products 
gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales was in  compared to in the improvement in gross margin percentage in was due to significantly increased sales of higher margin alignment sensors  better manufacturing leverage resulting from substantially higher production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs due to the much higher sales in compared to  the favorable impact of cost reduction programs and our new cost reduced smt inspection system products 
the electronic assembly market is highly price competitive  resulting in continual pressure on our gross margins 
we compensate for pricing pressure by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs 
for example  we believe our next generation qx aoi system products combines a reduction in cost with enhanced performance 
other recently introduced products including our solar wafer alignment camera  embedded process verification epv technology  the embedded solder paste inspection solution we developed for dek  and the se sensor we sell to viscom  have more favorable margins than our existing products 
semiconductor cost of revenue for our semiconductor segment increased by  or to million in  after increasing by  or to million in the increase in cost of revenue in both and was due to the higher level of sales 
semiconductor sales increased in and in gross margin as a percentage of semiconductor sales increased to in from in and in the gross margin benefit from higher wafersense sales in was mostly offset by an increase in scrap charges  resulting in the one percentage point improvement in gross margin 
the gross margin improvement as a percentage of semiconductor sales in was due to the cost benefit from consolidation of manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters  increased sales of higher margin wafersense products and improved manufacturing leverage  resulting from higher production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment in and development of our sales channel is critical to future growth and profitability 
we historically have maintained research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of recession and downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 

table of contents electronic assembly research and development expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in  and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expenses in resulted from increased inspection system development cost in singapore due to the weakened united states dollar  higher recruitment costs  along with additional wages and benefits due to annual pay increases and headcount additions  offset in part by lower project costs for proto types and consulting 
research and development expenses increased in compared to in we restored pay for our employees to levels prior to a pay cut implemented in response to the severe recession 
we also incurred higher costs for proto type materials related to new product development and added several new employees to assist with ongoing development efforts 
our research and development efforts in were focused on new products  including a new dual illumination sensor for our se platform providing enhanced solder paste measurement performance and repeatability  a new off line tabletop aoi system  our d inspection technology based on our strobe inspection module sim for both stand alone and embedded inspection solutions  and next generation smt alignment sensors 
we expect research and development costs to increase further in  as development continues on important new products including next generation stand alone aoi and spi inspection systems  embedded inspection solutions and next generation smt alignment sensors 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the slight increase in selling  general and administrative expense in was due to additional business development activities and the impact of the weakening united states dollar on the recorded value of costs attributable to our foreign sales offices  was mostly offset by a reduction in commissions for third party sales representatives  as more sales were sold through distribution channels  and a  reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in reflect higher sales and marketing costs  including commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from higher levels of smt inspection system sales  higher incentive compensation costs due  in part  to our improved financial performance  partially offset by lower expense for doubtful accounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses for include an  provision for doubtful accounts related to a key distributor of our smt inspection system products 
the distributor remains in business  and is committed to paying us the amount owed 
the  reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts in was due to partial collection of this receivable 
semiconductor research and development expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in research and development expenses were higher in due to increased expenditures for proto types  certification fees and consulting  reflecting our ongoing investment in the wafersense product line  particularly the new particle sensor we expect to introduce in selling  general and administrative expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in expense in reflects the overall increase in semiconductor sales and higher wafersense sales through third party sales representatives in  resulting in more third party commission expense 
the increase in reflects higher third party commission payments attributable to the higher level of sales 
interest income and other interest income and other includes interest earned on investments  realized gains and losses from sales of investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
interest income and other decreased in and due to lower interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on invested funds 
fluctuations in the level of gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and foreign exchange forward contracts can also impact the level of interest income and other reported in any given period 
we incurred foreign currency transaction gains  net of underlying currency hedges of  in  compared to foreign currency transaction gains  net of underlying currency hedges  of  in 
table of contents income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of  in reflecting an effective tax rate of 
our effective tax rate for and reflects the benefit of having a significant portion of our operations in singapore where corporate income tax rates are substantially lower than the united states 
fluctuations in the level of income in the united states and singapore will have an impact on our effective tax rate in any given annual period 
lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions favorably impacted our income tax rate by and our income tax rate by 
other items favorably impacting our income tax rate in and include benefits from the federal research and experimentation r d tax credit and the domestic manufacturer s production incentive deduction 
an increase in our valuation allowance for state r d tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards negatively impacted our effective tax rate by in we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
during  the internal revenue service completed audits of our and federal income tax returns 
our settlement with the internal revenue service did not have a material impact on our financial condition 
due to the carryback of our federal taxable loss to taxable years  the internal revenue service could potentially examine our federal income tax returns for those years 
the statute of limitations for examination of these returns had previously expired 
we received a federal income tax refund in of approximately million from carry back of our federal taxable loss 
our federal income tax return is currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential payments that may result from this audit 
we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased by million in due to cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of  offset in part by purchases of marketable securities  net of maturities and sales  of million  and capital expenditures of  our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased to million as of december   up from million as of december  operating activities provided million of cash in cash provided by operations included net income of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included decreases in inventory of million and increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of  and decreases in accounts payable of million 
better sales forecasting and inventory management resulted in lower inventory purchases in the latter half of and a corresponding reduction in inventory and accounts payable levels 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased due to higher warranty  commission and incentive compensation accruals  resulting from higher sales levels and improved operating results 
accounts receivable were higher due to a slight slowdown in our collection efficiency 
operating activities generated million of cash in cash provided by operations included net income of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and stock compensation costs 
changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included increases in accounts payable of million  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  advance customer payments of  and decreases in income tax refunds receivable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable and advance customer payments was due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of inventories were higher due to increased material purchases to support the higher level of sales expected in the second half of and early in the increase in accounts payable resulted from increased material purchases and a conscious effort on our part to extend the timing of vendor payments 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased due to higher warranty  commission and incentive compensation accruals  resulting from higher sales levels and improved operating results 
income tax refunds receivable decreased due to receipt of our anticipated tax refund resulting from carryback of our net operating loss to prior periods 

table of contents investing activities used million of cash in  compared to providing million of cash in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases  sales and maturities of those securities used million of cash in and provided million of cash in we used  of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
financing activities provided  of cash in  compared to providing  of cash in  all from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  purchase commitments for inventory can vary based on the volume of revenue and resulting inventory requirements 
while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations  purchase obligations   reserve for income taxes total contractual cash obligations    we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility for our sensor products  including the sensors used in our stand alone system products and our semiconductor products 
in march  we finalized a lease amendment for the facility that became effective july  the amendment provides that we will lease the current facility through december  the amendment contains escalation clauses and two renewal options of three years each 
our prior lease for the facility expired on june  in connection with the lease amendment  we reduced the size of the facility by  square feet 
we estimate a reduction in average annual rental expense over the term of the new lease amendment of approximately  per year 
purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed above 
related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  
table of contents inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
most of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
we manufacture our smt system products in singapore and a portion of our raw material purchases are denominated in singapore dollars 
we also have r d and sales personnel located in singapore and sales offices located in other parts of the world 
although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue  they can impact our costs and influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is months and  accordingly  at december   all of our open foreign exchange forward contracts had maturities of one year or less 
the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december  was approximately million 
at december   our open foreign exchange forward contracts were in an unrealized loss position equal to  on a pre tax basis due to a significant strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the singapore dollar in the later part of if the exchange rate between the us dollar and the singapore dollar were to remain unchanged over the next twelve months  we would realize this loss through our statement of operations 
however  because we do not fully hedge all of our future anticipated cash flows in singapore dollars  the portion of our costs that we do not hedge would be lower in relation to recent quarters 
if the us dollar were to weaken in future periods in relation to the singapore dollar  the unrealized loss on our open foreign exchange forward contracts would be reduced  but costs that are not hedged would increase 
for example  the unrealized pre tax loss on our open foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of january  had been reduced to approximately  due to a weaker us dollar 
the ultimate impact of any fluctuation in the relationship between the us dollar and singapore dollar is dependent on the level of singapore denominated cash flows in future periods 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued amended disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of the statement of changes in equity 
under the amended guidance  all changes in oci are to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the fasb subsequently met on october  and decided that the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred 
the remaining changes are effective january  early application is permitted 
there will be no impact to the consolidated financial results as the amendments relate only to changes in financial statement presentation 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms  and include shipping and handling costs 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt system products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
our multiple deliverable arrangements typically include the sale of an smt inspection system  installation and training  and in some cases  an extended warranty 
revenue from installation and training and extended warranty are recognized as the services are provided 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element at inception of an arrangement using the relative selling price method 
selling price is determined based on a selling price hierarchy  consisting of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence or estimated selling price 
management s best estimate of the selling price of an smt machine is based on the cost build up of the product and a reasonable margin based on geographic location and market conditions 
we used vsoe to establish fair value for extended warranty  installation and training services 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  at december  and  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties was  at december  and  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of  at december  and  at december  
table of contents valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
for goodwill  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
our remaining goodwill at december  and in the amount of  relates to our semiconductor reporting unit 
our recent analyses performed in the fourth quarters of and indicate that this goodwill is not impaired 
however  our conclusion could change in the future  if our assumptions about future economic conditions  revenue growth or profitability change 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not threshold ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
de recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and us gaap income  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards or credits are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 

table of contents in analyzing the need for valuation allowances  we first considered our history of cumulative losses for us income tax purposes over the past three years and also gave significant consideration to our results for us income tax purposes over the past five years  as the economic cycles in our industry have tended to average five years in length from peak to trough 
we also considered our forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
finally  we considered the length and severity of the recent global economic crisis  the impact that it had on our operating results and our expectation for continued rebound given the current recovery in the global economy and more specifically in our markets 
after considering all of these factors  and after considering other significant positive evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all of our us based deferred tax assets was not required at december  our results in both and were negatively impacted by the severe global economic recession  and we incurred a loss in the united states in both and  where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded 
we recorded a significant profit in both and achievement of ongoing profitability in the united states will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets without recording a valuation allowance 
the global electronics market has significantly strengthened since we are seeing ongoing demand from manufacturers of smt assembly equipment who purchase our alignment sensor products  and for our stand alone spi and aoi systems 
we believe that improved market conditions  the efficiencies in operations we have implemented  and the new products we have introduced and anticipate introducing in the next year  will lead to improved operating results and continued profitability in future periods 
if future results from our operations are less than projected  a valuation allowance may be required against virtually all of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
deferred tax assets at december  include net operating loss carry forwards incurred in the uk by cyberoptics ltd  which was acquired in the utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on cyberoptics ltd 
s ability to generate sufficient uk taxable income during the carry forward period 
the valuation allowances of  at december  and  at december  are needed for various long term state tax credit carry forwards  state operating loss carry forwards and capital losses for which recovery is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the valuation allowance was increased in for additional state tax credit and net operating loss carry forwards that failed to satisfy the more likely than not criteria for recovery 
derivatives and hedging 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded in the accompanying balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
the maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows is months 
accordingly  at december  and december   all of our open foreign exchange forward contracts had maturities of one year or less 
the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of our foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was approximately million at december  and million at december  we estimate hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis by considering the difference between the prices of a hypothetical forward contract maturing on the last day of a given month  to the prices of a series of hypothetically perfect daily forward contracts 
hedge ineffectiveness and the amounts excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in income on cash flow hedges were not material for the years ended december  and at december   the fair value of our foreign exchange forward contracts representing a loss in the amount of  was recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and their impact on accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  was inconsequential 
the fair value for our foreign exchange forward contracts is based on foreign currency spot and forward rates obtained from reputable financial institutions with resulting valuations periodically validated by obtaining foreign currency spot rates and forward quotes from other industry standard sources or third party or counterparty quotes
