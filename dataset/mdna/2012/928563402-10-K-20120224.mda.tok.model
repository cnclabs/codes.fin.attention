item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all dollar amounts expressed as numbers in this md a except share and per share amounts are in millions 
overview our primary source of revenues is the licensing of virtualization and virtualization based cloud infrastructure solutions and related support and services for use by businesses and organizations of all sizes and across numerous industries in their information technology it infrastructure 
we have developed a multi channel distribution model to expand our global presence and to reach various segments of the industry 
in  we derived over of our sales from our channel partners  which include distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
sales to our channel partners often involve three tiers of distribution a distributor  a reseller and an end user customer 
our sales force works collaboratively with our channel partners to introduce them to customers and new sales opportunities 
as we expand geographically  we expect to continue to add additional channel partners 
although we believe we are currently the leading provider of virtualization infrastructure software solutions  we face competitive threats to our leadership position from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater resources than we do  which could result in increased pressure to reduce prices on our offerings 
as a result  we believe it is important to continue to invest in strategic initiatives related to product research and development  market expansion and associated support functions to expand our industry leadership 
we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our product development objectives through continued investment in our existing infrastructure  supplemented with strategic hires and acquisitions  funded through the operating cash flows generated from the sale of our products and services 
we believe this is the appropriate priority for the long term health and growth of our business 
we expect to grow our business by broadening our virtualization infrastructure software solutions technology and product portfolio  increasing product awareness  promoting the adoption of virtualization and building long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of enterprise license agreements elas 
since the introduction of vmware vsphere in  we have introduced more products that build on the vsphere foundation  including vmware vsphere and a comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies  as well as vmware view we plan to continue to introduce additional products in the future 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  acquisitions designed to strengthen our product offerings or extend our strategy to deliver solutions that can be hosted at customer data centers or at service providers 
our current financial focus is on long term revenue growth to generate free cash flows to fund our expansion of industry segment share and to evolve our virtualization based products for data centers  desktop computers and cloud computing through a combination of internal development and acquisitions 
see non gaap financial measures for further information on free cash flows 
in evaluating our results  we also focus on operating margin excluding certain expenses which are included in our total operating expenses calculated in accordance with gaap 
the expenses excluded are stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses consisting of employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items 
we believe this measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
we are not currently focused on short term operating margin expansion  but rather on investing at appropriate rates to support our growth and future product offerings in what may be a substantially more competitive environment 
although our customers continue to adopt our product platform as a strategic investment that improves efficiency and flexibility for their business and enables substantial cost savings  we remain cautious about the macroeconomic environment 
the volatility we are observing in both the world economy and individual sovereign nations may impact it spending and demand for our products and services in we expect to continue to manage our resources prudently  while making key investments in support of our long term growth objectives 
income statement presentation as we operate our business in one operating segment  our revenues and operating expenses are presented and discussed at the consolidated level 
as a consequence of the timing differences in the recognition of license revenues and software maintenance revenues  variability in operating margin can result from differences between when we quote and contract for our services and when the cost is incurred 
variability in operating margin can also result when we recognize previously unearned foreign denominated 
table of contents software maintenance and license revenues in future periods 
due to our use of the us dollar as our functional currency  unearned revenue remains at its historical rate when recognized into revenue while our operating expenses in future periods are based upon the foreign exchange rates at that time 
sources of revenues license revenues our license revenues consist of revenues earned from the licensing of our software products 
these products are generally licensed on a perpetual basis 
license revenues are recognized when the elements of revenue recognition for the licensed software are complete  generally upon electronic shipment of the software 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
while some of our products are licensed on a subscription basis  subscription license revenues are not a material part of our business 
pricing models have generally been based upon the physical infrastructure  such as the number of physical desktop computers or server processors  on which our software runs 
we have recently begun to base pricing for some of our products on virtual  rather than purely physical  entitlements  while continuing to license such products on a perpetual basis 
we believe that this new pricing model better aligns with the shift to virtual and cloud based it environments by enabling customers to align cost with actual use and value derived  rather than purely with hardware configurations and capacity 
effective in the third quarter of  we began pricing certain of our management solutions on a per virtual machine basis 
in the third quarter of  we revised the pricing model for vmware vsphere effective with its general availability 
vmware vsphere will continue to be licensed perpetually on a per processor basis 
the two physical constraints  core and physical ram  have been eliminated  however  and replaced with a single virtualization based entitlement of virtual memory  or vram  which can be shared across a large pool of servers 
software maintenance revenues software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
our contract periods typically range from one to five years and include renewals of software maintenance sold after the initial software maintenance period expires 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts 
customers receive various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
customers who are party to software maintenance agreements with us are entitled to receive product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services revenues professional services include solution design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products  as these services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by our customers or by other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion  are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours incurred and estimated hours of completion 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based on hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
our professional services may be sold with software products or on a stand alone basis 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
operating expenses cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues principally consist of the amortization of capitalized software development costs and of intangibles  as well as royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third party providers and the cost of fulfillment of our software 
the cost of fulfillment of our software includes product packaging  personnel costs and related overhead associated with the physical and electronic delivery of our software products 
cost of services revenues our cost of services revenues include the costs of personnel and related overhead to deliver technical support for our products and to provide our professional services 
research and development expenses our research and development r d expenses include the personnel and related overhead associated with the r d of new product offerings and the enhancement of our existing software offerings  net of amounts capitalized 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  sales commissions and related overhead associated with the sale and marketing of our license and services offerings  as well as the cost of product launches and certain marketing initiatives  including our annual vmworld conferences in the us and europe 
sales commissions are generally earned and expensed when a firm order is received from the customer and may be expensed in a period other than the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the overall business 
these expenses include the costs associated with our facilities  finance  human resources  it infrastructure and legal departments  as well as expenses related to corporate costs and initiatives 
results of operations revenues our revenues in the years ended  and were as follows for the year ended december  change vs 
vs 
revenues license services software maintenance professional services total services revenues united states international total revenues were  in   in and  in  representing year over year increases of or in and or in in both and  we saw growth in license and services revenues  and growth in the united states and internationally  as compared with their respective prior years 
license revenues software license revenues were  in   in and  in  representing a year over year increase of or in and a year over year increase of or in license revenues benefited in primarily due to strong global demand for vsphere and continued growing interest in our end user computing and management solutions 
in as compared with  license revenues benefited from the improving macroeconomic environment  resulting in strong customer demand for the vsphere platform and growing interest in our end user computing and management solutions 
we have promoted the adoption of virtualization and built long term relationships with our customers through the adoption of elas 
elas continue to be an important component of our revenue growth and are offered both directly by us and through certain channel partners 
elas are a core element to our strategy to build long term relationships with customers as they commit to our virtualization infrastructure software solutions in their data centers 
elas provide a base from which to sell additional products  such as our application platform products  our end user computing products and our cloud infrastructure and management products 
under a typical ela  a portion of the revenues is attributed to the license and recognized immediately and the remainder is deferred and primarily recognized as software maintenance revenues in future periods 
in addition  elas typically include an initial maintenance period that is longer than other types of license sales 
in  we observed an increase in the volume of our elas as compared with due to growing customer interest  as well as strong renewals from existing ela customers 
in  we observed an increase in the volume of our elas as compared with due in part to growing international customer interest as well as the improved economic environment 
in addition  in and  a large number of customers included additional license purchases with their ela renewals  which 
table of contents had an average maintenance term of three years 
renewed elas typically include additional products and upgrades  as well expanded use of originally purchased products within the customer s environment  as compared with the initial ela 
services revenues services revenues were  in   in and in  representing a year over year increase of or in and or in the increase in services revenues during and was primarily attributable to growth in our software maintenance revenues 
software maintenance revenues were  in   in and in  representing a year over year increase of or in and or in in and  software maintenance revenues benefited from strong renewals  multi year software maintenance contracts sold in previous periods  and additional maintenance contracts sold in conjunction with new software license sales 
in   and  customers bought  on average  more than months of support and maintenance with each new license purchased  which we believe illustrates our customers commitment to vmware as a core element of their data center architecture and hybrid cloud strategy 
professional services revenues were in  in and in  representing a year over year increase of or in and or in in and  professional services revenues increased as growth in our license sales and installed base led to additional demand for our professional services 
as we continue to invest in our partners and expand our ecosystem of third party professionals with expertise in our solutions to independently provide professional services to our customers  we do not expect our professional services revenues to constitute an increasing component of our revenue mix 
as a result of this strategy  our professional services revenue can vary based on the delivery channels used in any given period as well as the timing of engagements 
revenue growth in constant currency we have invoiced and collected in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen and the australian dollar in their respective regions since may as a result  our total revenues are affected by changes in the value of the us dollar against these currencies 
in order to provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  management analyzes year over year revenue growth on a constant currency basis 
since we operate with the us dollar as our functional currency  unearned revenues for orders booked in currencies other than us dollars are converted into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect for the month in which each order is booked 
we calculate constant currency on license revenues recognized during the current period that were originally booked in currencies other than us dollars by comparing the exchange rates used to recognize revenue in the current period against the exchange rates used to recognize revenue in the comparable period 
we do not calculate constant currency on services revenues  which include software maintenance revenues and professional services revenues 
in  the year over year growth in license revenues measured on a constant currency basis was compared with as reported 
the year over year growth in total revenues in measured on a constant currency basis was compared with as reported 
given that we began to invoice and collect in currencies other than the us dollar during the second quarter of  we are not able to calculate a full year over year impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our revenues for as compared with unearned revenues our unearned revenues as of december  and were as follows december  unearned license revenues unearned software maintenance revenues unearned professional services revenues total unearned revenues the complexity of our unearned revenues has increased over time as a result of acquisitions  an expanded product portfolio and a broader range of pricing and packaging alternatives 
as of december   total unearned revenues increased by or to  from  at december  this increase was primarily due to growth in unearned software maintenance revenues  attributable to our growing base of maintenance contracts 
unearned license revenues are recognized either ratably or upon the delivery of existing products  future products or services 
future products include  in some cases  emerging products that are offered as part of product promotions where the purchaser of an existing product is entitled to receive a promotional product at no additional charge 
we regularly offer product promotions as a strategy to improve awareness of our emerging products 
to the extent promotional products have not been 
table of contents delivered and vsoe of fair value cannot be established  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product delivery obligations have been fulfilled 
unearned license revenue may also be recognized ratably  which is generally due to a right to receive unspecified future products or a lack of vsoe of fair value on the software maintenance element of the arrangement 
unearned software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over terms from one to five years with a weighted average remaining term at december  of approximately years 
unearned professional services revenues result primarily from prepaid professional services  including training  and are generally recognized as the services are delivered 
we believe our overall unearned revenue balance improves predictability of future revenues and that it is a key indicator of the health and growth of our business

table of contents core operating expenses is a non gaap financial measure that excludes stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses from our total operating expenses calculated in accordance with gaap 
the other expenses excluded are employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related items 
see non gaap financial measures below for further information 
operating margins increased from in to in and increased from in to in the increases in our operating margins in and compared with their respective prior years primarily related to the increases in our revenues  which outpaced the increases in our expenses 
in evaluating our results  we focus on core operating expenses 
we believe that our core operating expenses reflect our business in a manner that allows meaningful period to period comparisons 
our core operating expenses are reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  in the table above 
core operating expenses the following discussion of our core operating expenses and the components comprising our core operating expenses highlights the factors that we focus on when evaluating our operating margin and operating expenses 
the increases or decreases in operating expenses discussed in this section do not include changes relating to stock based compensation  the net effect of the amortization and capitalization of software development costs and certain other expenses  which consist of employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition related items 
core operating expenses increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with as quantified below  these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  bonuses  commissions  and recruiting and training 
the increases in employee related expenses for both periods were largely a result of an increase in headcount of over  employees during  driven by strategic hiring  business growth and business acquisitions 
a portion of our core operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  marketing  and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  and are thus exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
core operating expenses were negatively impacted by in and by in  as compared with their respective prior years  due to the effect of fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
cost of license revenues core operating expenses in cost of license revenues increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increases were primarily due to increases of and  respectively  in royalty and licensing costs for technology licensed from third party providers that is used in our products 
additionally  cost of license revenues increased by in for it development costs 
cost of services revenues core operating expenses in cost of services revenues increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  which was largely driven by incremental growth in headcount  as well as an increase in expenses of for it development costs 
additionally  our third party professional services costs increased by to provide technical support and professional services primarily in connection with increased services revenues 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies also contributed to the overall increase in costs of services revenues 
the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  which was largely driven by incremental growth in headcount  as well as an increase in third party professional services costs of to provide professional services and training  primarily associated with increased services revenues 
research and development expenses core operating expenses for r d increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increases in and were primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of and  respectively  which were primarily driven by incremental growth in headcount 
sales and marketing expenses core operating expenses for sales and marketing increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to growth in employee related expenses of  driven by incremental growth in headcount and by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes 
additionally  the costs of marketing programs increased by and travel and entertainment expense increased by in support of our expanding markets and sales efforts 
the negative impact of from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies further contributed to the increase 
the increase in was primarily due to 
table of contents growth in employee related expenses of driven by incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions as well as by higher commission expense due to increased sales volumes 
in support of our expanding markets and sales efforts  the costs of marketing programs increased by  and travel and entertainment expense increased by we also incurred additional expenses of for it infrastructure development to support revenue growth  as well as consulting projects 
general and administrative expenses core operating expenses for general and administrative increased by or in compared with and by or in compared with the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to employee related expenses primarily due to incremental growth in headcount 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase of related to corporate expenses  including contributions to our charitable foundation and legal fees 
also contributing to the increase in expenses in was depreciation and equipment expenses of and employee related expenses of due to the incremental growth in headcount 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  stock based compensation  excluding amounts capitalized stock based compensation capitalized stock based compensation  including amounts capitalized stock based compensation expense was in  in and in  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in over was primarily due to an increase of from new awards issued to our existing employees both in the second half of and the second quarter of  as well as an increase of for awards made to new employees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of primarily related to fully vested grants 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in over was primarily due to an increase of for grants made to new employees in  an increase of from new awards made to our existing employees  and an increase of from equity awards issued in connection with the acquisition of springsource late in the third quarter of these increases were offset in part by a decrease of primarily related to fully vested grants 
stock based compensation is recorded to each operating expense category based upon the function of the employee to whom the stock based compensation relates and fluctuates based upon the value and number of awards granted 
compensation philosophy varies by function  resulting in different weightings of cash incentives versus equity incentives 
as a result  functions with larger cash based components  such as sales commissions  will have comparatively lower stock based compensation expense than other functions 
as of december   the total unamortized fair value of our outstanding equity based awards held by our employees was approximately and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
capitalized software development costs  net development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established and as our business  products and go to market strategy have evolved  we have continued to evaluate when technological feasibility is established 
following the release of vsphere and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of  we determined that vmware s go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this change in strategy  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
for future releases  we expect our products to be available for general release soon after technological feasibility has been established 
given that we expect the majority of our product offerings to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with our other product offerings  the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods 
in the fourth quarter of  all software development costs were expensed as incurred 
our r d expenses and amounts that we have capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
additionally  future changes in our judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or additional changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  could materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability was to increase again in the future  the amount of capitalized costs would likely increase 

table of contents in  and  we capitalized including of stock based compensation  including of stock based compensation and including of stock based compensation  respectively  of costs incurred for the development of software products 
these amounts have been excluded from r d expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
capitalized software development costs increased by in as compared with primarily due to an increase of for the development of vmware vsphere year over year  which was partially offset by a decrease of due to the timing of when certain products  including prior versions of vsphere  reached technological feasibility 
the change in our go to market strategy and resulting decrease in the length of time between technological feasibility of our products and the date those products are available for general release to customers did not materially impact the amount of software development costs we capitalized in capitalized software development costs decreased by in as compared with primarily due to the timing of when products reached technological feasibility 
in future periods  we expect our software development costs to be recorded as r d expense as incurred due to the aforementioned change in our go to market strategy 
in  and  amortization expense from capitalized software development costs were  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in cost of license revenues on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in amortization of software development costs of in as compared with was primarily due to a net decrease of related to the amortization of prior versions of vsphere  which was partially offset by an increase of related to the general release of vmware vsphere in the second half of the increase in the amortization of software development costs of in compared with was primarily due to the general release of vmware vsphere in the second quarter of and the subsequent release of version in the third quarter of this resulted in an increase in amortization of in as compared with that was partially offset by of amortization for certain capitalized projects that were fully amortized prior to the end of in future periods  we expect our amortization expense from capitalized software development costs to decline as software development costs are expected to be recorded as r d expense as incurred given our current go to market strategy 
other operating expenses other operating expenses consist of employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions and intangible amortization  which are recorded to each individual line of operating expense on our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
additionally  other operating expenses include acquisition related items  which are recorded to general and administrative expense on our income statement 
other operating expenses were in  in and in  representing an increase of in and an increase of in the increase in was primarily due to additional intangible amortization of  primarily resulting from new acquisitions  of which was recorded to costs of license revenues on our income statement 
the increase in was primarily due to additional intangible amortization of  primarily resulting from new acquisitions  of which was recorded to costs of license revenues on our income statement 
additionally  in  there was an increase of in employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  which was driven by the increase in the market value of our stock and the number of awards exercised  sold or vested 
investment income investment income increased by to in from in and decreased by to in from in investment income primarily consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances partially offset by the amortization of premiums paid on fixed income securities 
investment income increased in as compared with primarily due to an increase in the average rate of interest earned on our portfolio as a result of our shift from a cash and cash equivalents portfolio primarily invested in money market funds to a short term investment portfolio of fixed income securities 
we began investing in fixed income securities in the second quarter of in order to achieve investment returns in line with our objectives of principal preservation and risk management 
additionally  investment income increased in due to increased cash equivalent and short term investment balances available for investment 
the decrease in investment income in compared with was not material 
other income expense  net other income  net of in changed by as compared with other expense  net of in other expense  net of in changed by from other income  net of in the change in compared with was primarily due to a gain recognized on the sale of our investment in terremark worldwide  inc in the change in compared with was primarily due to of foreign exchange loss from the net impact of underlying foreign currency exposure and foreign currency forward contracts  as well as a gain of recognized in from the remeasurement to fair value of a previously held equity interest in springsource in connection with our acquisition of springsource 

table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate for was as compared with for and for the lower effective tax rate in as compared to was primarily attributable to i a favorable impact of resulting from a shift in the mix of income before tax from the us to international jurisdictions primarily resulting from how certain expenses are allocated to our world wide subsidiaries  ii a favorable impact of resulting from a decrease in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before income tax primarily due to audit settlements  and iii a favorable impact of resulting from the finalization of the tax returns related to changes in estimates in how certain expenses are allocated to our world wide subsidiaries and a change in estimate in the us federal research tax credit calculation 
these favorable changes were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of from a decrease in the us state deferred tax assets due to a decrease in our future effective state tax rate 
the increase in effective tax rate to in from in was primarily attributable to a jurisdictional shift of income from lower tax jurisdictions to the us  which was partially offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax positions relative to income before income tax 
our rate of taxation in foreign jurisdictions is lower than the us tax rate 
our international income is primarily earned by our subsidiaries in ireland  where the statutory tax rate is 
we do not believe that any recent or currently expected developments in non us tax jurisdictions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our effective tax rate 
as of december   our total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were  of which  were held outside the us if these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on related undistributed earnings to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non us earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows generated from our us operations  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
all income earned abroad  except for previously taxed income for us tax purposes  is considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations and no provision for us taxes has been provided with respect thereto 
our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  changes in our business  regulations  or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  changes in our international organization  shifts in the amount of income before tax earned in the us as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
the tax rate is expected to be higher than the fiscal year tax rate primarily due to the expectation that the amount of benefit related to unrecognized tax positions released during will be lower than the amount released during  relative to income before income tax  and due to the expiration of the federal r d credit on december  the effective tax rate for fiscal year is based upon the income for the year  the composition of the income in different countries  and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences related to the resolution of audits or changes in uncertain tax positions 
our aggregate income tax rate in foreign jurisdictions is lower than our income tax rate in the united states 
although we file a federal consolidated tax return with emc  we calculate our income tax provision on a stand alone basis 
our effective tax rate in the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the rate at which the provision for income taxes is calculated differs from the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to different tax rates in foreign jurisdictions where income is earned and considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
we have been included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and expect to continue to be included in such consolidated group for periods in which emc owns at least of the total voting power and value of our outstanding stock as calculated for us federal income tax purposes 
the percentage of voting power and value calculated for us federal income tax purposes may differ from the percentage of outstanding shares beneficially owned by emc due to the greater voting power of our class b common stock as compared to our class a common stock and other factors 
each member of a consolidated group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently determined deficiency thereon 
should emc s ownership fall below of the total voting power or value of our outstanding stock in any period  then we would no longer be included in the emc consolidated group for us federal income tax purposes  and thus we would no longer be liable in the event that any income tax liability was incurred  but not discharged  by any other member of the emc consolidated group 
additionally  our us federal income tax would be reported separately from that of the emc consolidated group 
our relationship with emc as of december   emc owned  shares of class a common stock and all  shares of class b common stock  representing of our total outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
in april  we acquired certain assets relating to emc s mozy cloud based data storage and data services  including 
table of contents certain data center assets and a license to certain intellectual property  for approximately we also entered into an operational support agreement with emc pursuant to which we took over responsibility to operate the mozy service on behalf of emc 
we hired more than mozy employees and  pursuant to the support agreement  costs incurred by us to support emc s mozy services  plus a mark up intended to approximate third party costs  are reimbursed to us by emc 
on the consolidated statements of income  such amounts were approximately in  including a markup of  and were recorded as a reduction to the costs we incurred 
emc retained ownership of the mozy business and its remaining assets 
emc continues to be responsible to mozy customers for mozy products and services  and continues to recognize revenue from such products and services 
as such  the assets acquired from emc did not constitute a business and were accounted for as an asset purchase between entities under common control pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  we included the carrying value of the transferred assets as of the date of transfer in our consolidated financial statements 
in april  we acquired certain software product technology and expertise from emc s ionix it management business for cash consideration of emc retained the ionix brand and will continue to offer customers the products acquired by us  pursuant to the ongoing reseller agreement between emc and us 
during the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of contingent amounts were paid to emc 
these amounts were recorded as equity transactions and were offsets to the initial capital contribution from emc 
as of december   all contingent payments under the agreement had been made 
pursuant to the ongoing reseller arrangement with emc that commenced in  emc bundles our products and services with emc s hardware and sells them to end users 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues of  and  respectively  from products and services sold pursuant to our reseller arrangement with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from products and services sold under the reseller arrangement were included in unearned revenues 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized professional services revenues of  and  respectively  for services provided to emc s customers pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from professional services to emc customers were included in unearned revenues 
in the years ended december   and  we recognized revenues of  and  respectively  from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use pursuant to our contractual agreements with emc 
as of december  and  and  respectively  of revenues from server and desktop products and services purchased by emc for internal use were included in unearned revenues 
we purchased storage systems and software  as well as consulting services  from emc for  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in certain geographic regions where we do not have an established legal entity  we contract with emc subsidiaries for support services and emc employees who are managed by our personnel 
the costs incurred by emc on our behalf related to these employees are passed on to us and we are charged a mark up intended to approximate costs that would have been charged had we contracted for such services with an unrelated third party

liquidity and capital resources during  we began investing in fixed income securities  which drove a shift from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments 
our fixed income investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars and consists of various holdings  types and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our operating activities in  and  respectively  generated sufficient cash to meet our operating needs 
our cash flows for the years ended  and were as follows for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in evaluating our liquidity internally  we focus on long term  sustainable growth in free cash flows and in non gaap cash flows from operating activities non gaap operating cash flows 
we define non gaap operating cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized software development costs plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we define free cash flows  also a non gaap financial measure  as non gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures

historically  we have invested excess cash predominantly in money market securities that are liquid and of high quality investment grade 
the fair value for money market securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the valuation date 
we limit the amount of our domestic and international investments with any single issuer and any single financial institution  and also monitor the diversity of the portfolio  thereby diversifying the credit risk 
in the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities 
as of december   we held a diversified portfolio of money market funds and fixed income securities  which primarily consisted of highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  us municipal obligations  and us and foreign corporate debt securities 
within our portfolio  we held of foreign government and agencies securities  of which was deemed sovereign debt  at december  these sovereign debt securities had an average credit rating of aaa and were predominantly from australia  canada and great britain 
none of the securities deemed sovereign debt were from greece  ireland  italy  portugal or spain 
as of december   our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  of which  was held outside the us if these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on related undistributed earnings to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non us earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in and to use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  together with any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements including strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
non cash adjustments include depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  amortization of premiums paid upon purchase of investments in our fixed income portfolio  stock based compensation expense  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and other adjustments 
net changes in assets and liabilities were impacted by increases in unearned revenues in the periods presented  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
cash provided by operating activities increased by to  in from  in the increase in operating cash flows for was primarily the result of an increase in cash collections from customers driven by strong sales volumes 
in addition  we benefited from the net receipt of from emc related to income taxes 
during  there were no significant amounts collected from or paid to emc under the tax sharing agreement 
under the tax sharing agreement  emc is obligated to pay us an amount equal to the tax benefit generated by us that emc will recognize on its consolidated tax return 
the net receipt of in primarily related to refunds received for both the and tax years 
we expect the amount of cash received related to tax refunds to decline in as compared to the increase in cash collections and the benefit from the collection of the income tax receivable was partially offset by increases in our core operating expenses  primarily related to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities increased by to  in from in the increase in operating cash flows for was the result of an increase in cash collections from customers driven by strong sales volume 
the increase in cash collections was partially offset by increases in our core operating expenses  primarily related to incremental headcount from strategic hiring and business acquisitions as well as an increase in the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation due to the increase in market value of our stock

all purchases of fixed income securities were classified as cash outflows from investing activities 
we classified these investments as short term investments on our consolidated balance sheets based upon the nature of the security and their availability for use in current operations or for other purposes  such as business acquisitions and strategic investments

non gaap financial measures regulation s k item e  use of non gaap financial measures in commission filings  defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non gaap financial information 
our measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows each meet the definition of a non gaap financial measure 
core operating expenses management uses the non gaap measure of core operating expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods  for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes  for short and long term operating plans  to calculate bonus payments and to evaluate our financial performance  the performance of its individual functional groups and the ability of operations to generate cash 
management believes that core operating expenses reflect our business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business  as they exclude certain expenses that are not reflective of our operating results 
we define core operating expenses as our total operating expenses excluding the following components  which we believe are not reflective of our operational expenses 
in each case  for the reasons set forth below  management believes that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management  in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is generally fixed at the time the stock based instrument is granted and amortized over a period of several years 
although stock based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives  determining the fair value of certain of the stock based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting  future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
furthermore  unlike cash compensation  the value of stock options  which is an element of our ongoing stock based compensation expense  is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors  such as market volatility  that are beyond our control 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs 
capitalized software development costs encompasses capitalization of development costs and the subsequent amortization of the capitalized costs over the useful life of the product 
amortization and capitalization of software development costs can vary significantly depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
in future periods  we expect our amortization expense from capitalized software development costs to decline as software development costs are expected to be recorded as r d expense as incurred given our current go to market strategy  which changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this change in strategy  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
given that we expect the majority of our product offerings to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with our other product offerings  the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods 
for additional information  see results of operations capitalized software development costs  net above 
other expenses 
other expenses excluded are employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related items 
the amount of employer payroll taxes on stock based compensation is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business 
regarding the amortization of intangible assets  a portion of the purchase price of our acquisitions is generally allocated to intangible assets  such as intellectual property  and is subject to amortization 
additionally  the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
acquisition related items include direct costs of acquisitions  such as transaction fees  which vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition 
however  we do not acquire businesses on 
table of contents a predictable cycle 
non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows we define non gaap operating cash flows as net cash provided by operating activities less capitalized software development costs plus the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we define free cash flows as non gaap operating cash flows less capital expenditures 
management uses non gaap operating cash flows as another measure of cash flows from operations because this measure offers a perspective of our operating cash flows that aligns with how management internally views our overall and individual functional group operating results 
when viewing operating results for evaluating our past performance and for planning purposes  management excludes certain items  including the effect of capitalizing and amortizing software development costs and items related to stock based compensation  which are also excluded in the non gaap operating cash flows measure 
management uses free cash flows as a measure of financial progress in our business  as it balances operating results  cash management and capital efficiency 
in addition to quarterly free cash flows  management also focuses on trailing twelve month free cash flows  as free cash flows can be volatile in the short term 
we believe that our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows provide useful information to investors and others  as they allow for meaningful period to period comparisons of our operating cash flows for analysis of trends in our business 
additionally  we believe that information regarding non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows provides investors and others with an important perspective on cash that we may choose to make available for strategic acquisitions and investments  the repurchase of shares  operations and other capital expenditures 
we deduct capitalization of software development costs from both measures because these costs are considered to be a necessary component of our operations and the amount capitalized under gaap can vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of products reaching technological feasibility and being made generally available 
consequently  software development costs paid out during a period that are capitalized under gaap and do not impact gaap operating cash flows for that period do result in a decrease to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and non gaap free cash flows  thereby providing management with useful measures of cash flows generated from operations during the period 
we add back the excess income tax benefits from stock based compensation to our measures of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows as management internally views cash flows arising from income taxes as similar to operating cash flows rather than as financing cash flows as required under gaap 
furthermore  we exclude capital expenditures on property and equipment from free cash flows because these expenditures are also considered to be a necessary component of our operations 
limitations on the use of non gaap financial measures a limitation of our non gaap financial measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows is that they do not have uniform definitions 
our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies  including peer companies  and therefore comparability may be limited 
thus  our non gaap measures of core operating expenses  non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  or in isolation from  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
additionally  in the case of stock based compensation  if we did not pay out a portion of compensation in the form of stock based compensation and related employer payroll taxes  the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position 
further  the non gaap measure of core operating expenses has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations and are reflected in the gaap measure of total operating expenses 
we compensate for these limitations by reconciling core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety  not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non gaap financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable gaap financial measures 
see results of operations operating expenses for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of core operating expenses to the most comparable gaap measure  total operating expenses  for the years ended december   and see liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of non gaap operating cash flows and free cash flows to the most comparable gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities  for the years ended december   and off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  distributors  resellers  system vendors and systems integrators 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that one of our products infringes or misappropriates a patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret or other intellectual 
table of contents property right 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury  or the acts or omissions by us and our employees  agents or representatives 
we have agreements with certain vendors  financial institutions  lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for specified matters  such as acts and omissions by us and our employees  agents  or representatives 
we have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that we have obtained the right to use in our products and agreements 
under some of these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors and executive officers  to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer 
our by laws and charter also provide for indemnification of our directors and officers to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or executive officer 
we also indemnify certain employees who provide service with respect to employee benefits plans  including the members of the administrative committee of the vmware k plan  and employees who serve as directors or officers of our subsidiaries 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the former directors and officers of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons 
we typically purchase a tail directors and officers insurance policy  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification obligations related to the former officers and directors of an acquired company 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited history with prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable to emc operating leases other agreements sub total uncertain tax positions total the note is due and payable in full on april   however  we can pay down the note at an earlier date in full or in part at our election 
our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world 
consisting of various contractual agreements  which include commitments on the lease for our washington data center facility 
as of december   we had of non current net unrecognized tax benefits under generally accepted accounting guidance 
we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these obligations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the critical accounting 
table of contents policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other significant accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a  overview and basis of presentation  to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the licensing of software and related services 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we recognize license revenues from the sale of software licenses when risk of loss transfers  which is generally upon electronic shipment 
we primarily license our software under perpetual licenses through our channel of distributors  resellers  system vendors  systems integrators and our direct sales force 
to the extent we offer product promotions and the promotional products are not yet available and vsoe of fair value cannot be established  the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product obligations have been fulfilled 
we defer revenues relating to products that have shipped into our channel until our products are sold through to the next tier of the channel 
we estimate and record reserves for products that are not sold through the channel based on historical trends and relevant current information 
for software sold by system vendors that is bundled with their hardware  unless we have a separate license agreement which governs the transaction  revenue is recognized in arrears upon the receipt of binding royalty reports 
the accuracy of our reserves depends on our ability to estimate the product sold through the channels and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we offer rebates to certain channel partners  which are recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time the related product sale is recognized 
when rebates are based on the set percentage of actual sales  we recognize the costs of the rebates as a reduction of revenue when the underlying revenue is recognized 
in cases where rebates are earned if a cumulative level of sales is achieved  we recognize the cost of the rebates as a reduction of revenue proportionally for each sale that is required to achieve the target 
the estimated reserves for channel rebates and sales incentives are based on channel partners actual performance against the terms and conditions of the programs  historical trends and the value of the rebates 
the accuracy of these reserves for these rebates and sales incentives depends on our ability to estimate these items and could have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
with limited exceptions  vmware s return policy does not allow product returns for a refund 
certain distributors and resellers may rotate stock when new versions of a product are released 
we estimate future product returns at the time of sale 
our estimate is based on historical return rates  levels of inventory held by distributors and resellers and other relevant factors 
the accuracy of these reserves depends on our ability to estimate sales returns and stock rotation among other criteria 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
returns have not been material to date and have been in line with our expectations 
our services revenues consist of software maintenance and professional services 
we recognize software maintenance revenues ratably over the contract period 
typically  our software maintenance contract periods range from one to five years 
professional services include design  implementation and training 
professional services are not considered essential to the functionality of our products because services do not alter the product capabilities and may be performed by customers or other vendors 
professional services engagements performed for a fixed fee  for which we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion are recognized on a proportional performance basis based on hours and direct expenses incurred 
professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis are recognized based upon hours incurred 
revenues on all other professional services engagements are recognized upon completion 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments regarding our services revenues  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
our software products are typically sold with software maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for software maintenance services is established by the rates charged in stand alone sales of software maintenance contracts 
our software products may also be sold with professional services 
vsoe of fair value for professional services is based upon the standard rates we charge for such services when sold separately 
the revenues allocated to the software license included in multiple element contracts represent the residual amount of the contract after the fair value of the other elements has been determined 
our multiple element arrangements typically fall into one or more of the following categories arrangements including undelivered elements for which vsoe of fair value has been established 
revenue for those undelivered items is recognized ratably over the service period  or as the services are delivered 
revenue allocated to the delivered elements is recognized upfront  
table of contents arrangements including specified product elements for which vsoe of fair value cannot be established 
the entire arrangement fee is deferred until either vsoe of fair value is established or the specified products are delivered  arrangements including undelivered elements without vsoe of fair value that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products where all of the undelivered elements are delivered ratably over time 
revenue for the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably  once the services have commenced  over the longest delivery period  arrangements including undelivered elements without vsoe of fair value that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products where one or more of the elements are not delivered ratably over time 
the entire arrangement fee is deferred until vsoe of fair value is established or only elements that are delivered ratably over time remain 
at such time  a pro rated share of revenue is recognized immediately with any remaining fee recognized ratably over the longest remaining ratable delivery period 
customers under software maintenance agreements are entitled to receive updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis  and various types of technical support based on the level of support purchased 
in the event specific features or functionalities  entitlements or the release number of an upgrade have been announced but not delivered  and customers will receive that upgrade as part of a current software maintenance contract  a specified upgrade is deemed created 
as a result of the specified upgrade  product revenues are deferred on purchases made after the announcement date until delivery of the upgrade for those purchases that include the current version of the product subject to the announcement 
the amount and elements to be deferred are dependent on whether the company has established vsoe of fair value for the upgrade 
vsoe of fair value of these upgrades is established based upon the price set by management 
we have a history of selling such upgrades on a stand alone basis 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent with the sale of these elements on a stand alone basis 
this determination could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
to date  our multiple element arrangements have included only software and software related deliverables accounted for using software revenue recognition rules 
however  we may in the future bundle our software and software related elements with services or other non software elements that would require accounting under other relevant multiple element revenue recognition rules 
capitalized software development costs development costs of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed are subject to capitalization beginning when the product s technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established and as our business  products and go to market strategy have evolved  we have continued to evaluate when technological feasibility is established 
following the release of vsphere and the comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies in the third quarter of  we determined that vmware s go to market strategy had changed from single solutions to product suite solutions 
as a result of this  and the related increased importance of interoperability between our products  the length of time between achieving technological feasibility and general release to customers significantly decreased 
for future releases  we expect our products to be available for general release soon after technological feasibility has been established 
given that we expect the majority of our product offerings to be suites or to have key components that interoperate with our other product offerings  the costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are expected to be immaterial in future periods 
in the fourth quarter of  all software development costs were expensed as incurred 
our r d expenses and amounts that we have capitalized as software development costs may not be comparable to our peer companies due to differences in judgment as to when technological feasibility has been reached or differences in judgment regarding when the product is available for general release 
additionally  future changes in our judgment as to when technological feasibility is established  or additional changes in our business  including our go to market strategy  could materially impact the amount of costs capitalized 
for example  if the length of time between technological feasibility and general availability was to increase again in the future  the amount of capitalized costs would likely increase 
generally accepted accounting principles require annual amortization expense of capitalized software development costs to be the greater of the amounts computed using the ratio of current gross revenue to a product s total current and anticipated revenues  or the straight line method over the product s remaining estimated economic life 
to date  we have amortized these costs using the straight line method as it is the greater of the two amounts 
the costs are amortized over periods ranging from to months  which represent the product s estimated economic life 
the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors such as anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
material differences in amortization amounts could occur as a result of changes in the periods over which we actually generate revenues or the amounts of revenues generated 

table of contents asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt expense could exceed our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period during which the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
as we operate our business in one operating segment and one reporting unit  our goodwill is assessed at the consolidated level for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the assessment is performed by comparing the market value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
accounting for income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  management judgment is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we do not provide for a us income tax liability on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the earnings of non us subsidiaries  which reflect full provision for non us income taxes  are indefinitely reinvested in non us operations or will be remitted substantially free of additional tax 
if these overseas funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on related undistributed earnings to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non us earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows generated from our us operations  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in locations in which it is needed 
income taxes are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although we are included in the consolidated tax return of emc 
the difference between the income taxes payable that is calculated on a separate return basis and the amount actually paid to emc pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with emc is presented as a component of additional paid in capital 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards  board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard asu 
asu is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
comprehensive income will either have to be presented in one continuous statement of comprehensive 
table of contents income or two separate consecutive statements 
in december  an amendment was issued to the update that defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
we adopted this accounting standard update  as amended  on january   and will present comprehensive income in accordance with the requirements of the standard 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards asu 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for each reporting entity s first interim and annual reporting period that begins after december  and should be applied prospectively 
early application is not permitted 
we are not expecting a significant impact from the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we operate in foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in historically  our revenue contracts were primarily denominated in us dollars 
in may  we began to invoice and collect in the euro  the british pound  the japanese yen and the australian dollar in their respective regions 
additionally  a portion of our operating expenses  primarily the cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services  sales and sales support and research and development  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those currencies in which we also invoice and collect 
revenues resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations which can affect our operating income 
as exchange rates vary  operating margins may differ materially from expectations 
core operating expenses were negatively impacted by million in and million in  and benefited by million in  due to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies as compared with the same period in the prior year 
we calculate the foreign currency impact on our operating expenses as the difference between operating expenses translated at current exchange rates and the same expenses translated at prior period exchange rates 
to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward contracts  as described below 
cash flow hedging activities 
to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations resulting from operating expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts starting in the fourth quarter of we expect to enter into cash flow hedges semi annually with maturities of six months or less 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  balance sheet hedging activities 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities against movements in certain foreign exchange rates 
our foreign currency forward contracts are generally traded on a monthly basis with a typical contractual term of one month 
as of december   we had outstanding forward contracts with a total notional value of million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was immaterial as of december  sensitivity analysis 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of would have resulted in a potential loss in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts used in both the cash flow hedging and balance sheet hedging activities of million as of december  this sensitivity analysis disregards any potentially offsetting gain that may be associated with the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that we hedge 
this analysis also assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we do not enter into speculative foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk fixed income securities during the second quarter of  we began investing in fixed income securities 
our fixed income investment portfolio is 
table of contents denominated in us dollars and consists of various holdings  types and maturities 
our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
hypothetical changes in interest rates of basis points and basis points would have changed the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio as of december  by million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates  however  interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risk  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during these instruments are not leveraged and we do not enter into speculative securities for trading purposes 
see notes c and d to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
note payable to emc as of december   million was outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet in relation to the note payable to emc 
the interest rate on the note payable was as of december  and as of both december  and in  and  million  million and million  respectively  of interest expense was recorded related to the note payable 
the note may be repaid  without penalty  at any time 
in june  we and emc amended and restated the note to extend the maturity date of the note to april  and to modify the principal amount of the note to reflect the outstanding balance of million 
the amended agreement continues to bear an interest rate of the day libor plus basis points  with interest payable quarterly in arrears 
the interest rate on the note resets quarterly and is determined on the two business days prior to the first day of each fiscal quarter 
if the interest rate on the note payable were to change basis points from the december  rate and assuming no additional repayments on the principal were made  our annual interest expense would change by million 
equity price risk during  we sold our investment in terremark worldwide  inc  which was acquired by verizon in a cash transaction 
as a result of the sale of our investment  we no longer have investments in equity securities that expose us to market risk associated with publicly traded equity securities
