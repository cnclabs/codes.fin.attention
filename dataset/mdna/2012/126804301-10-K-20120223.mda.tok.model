developments in legislation and regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act was signed into law in july and has made extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and credit rating agencies and requires significant rule making 
in addition  the reform act along with the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act mandated multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
the reform act imposes a moratorium on the approval of applications for federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance for an industrial bank  credit card bank  or trust bank that is owned by a commercial firm 
furthermore  the fdic must  under most circumstances  disapprove any change in control that would result in direct or indirect control by a commercial firm of a credit card bank  such as wfb 
for purposes of this provision  a company is a commercial firm if its consolidated annual gross revenues from activities that are financial in nature and  if applicable  from the ownership or control of one or more insured depository institutions  in the aggregate  represent less than of its consolidated annual gross revenues 
the reform act does not  however  eliminate the exception from the definition of bank under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhca for credit card banks  such as wfb 
as directed by the reform act  the united states government accountability office released a report on january   that examines the potential implications of eliminating certain exceptions under the bhca  including the exception for credit card banks 
it is unclear whether this report will lead to any additional legislative or regulatory action 
if the credit card bank exception were eliminated or modified  we may be required to divest our ownership of wfb unless we were willing and able to become a bank holding company under the bhca 
any such forced divestiture would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the reform act established the new independent consumer financial protection bureau  which will have broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer products  including credit cards 
the reform act will also affect a number of significant changes relating to asset backed securities  including additional oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies and additional reporting and disclosure requirements 
the changes resulting from the reform act may impact our profitability  require changes to certain of wfb s business practices  impose upon wfb more stringent capital  liquidity  and leverage ratio requirements  increase fdic deposit insurance premiums  or otherwise adversely affect wfb s business 
these changes may also require wfb to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 
several rules and regulations have recently been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset backed securities 
on october   the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of currency  the fdic  and the securities and exchange commission sec issued proposed regulations implementing certain provisions under the reform act limiting proprietary trading and sponsorship or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds the volcker rule 
the proposed regulations are complex and have been the subject of extensive comment 
as proposed  these regulations may apply to us and could limit our ability to engage in the types of transactions covered by the volcker rule and may impose potentially burdensome compliance  monitoring  and reporting obligations 
there remains considerable uncertainty regarding whether the final regulations implementing the volcker rule will differ from the proposed regulations  and the effect of any final regulations on our retail and direct businesses and wfb 
on september   the sec proposed a new rule under the securities act of  as amended  to implement certain provisions of the reform act 
under the proposed rule  an underwriter  placement agent  initial purchaser  or sponsor of an asset backed security  or any affiliate of any such person  shall not at any time within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset backed security  engage in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity 
the proposed rule would exempt certain risk mitigating hedging activities  liquidity commitments  and bona fide market making activity 
it is not clear how the final rule will differ from the proposed rule  if at all 
the final rule s impact on the securitization market and wfb is also unclear at this time 
the cabela s master credit card trust and related entities collectively referred to as the trust is structured to come within the exemption from the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act provided by investment company act rule a on august   the sec issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible amendments to investment company act rule a at this time  it is uncertain what form the related proposed and final rules will take  whether the trust would continue to be eligible to rely on the exemption provided by investment company act rule a  and whether the trust would qualify for any other investment company act exemption 
on july   the sec re proposed certain rules for asset backed securities offerings sec regulation ab ii which were originally proposed by the sec on april  if adopted  sec regulation ab ii would substantially change the disclosure  reporting  and offering process for private offerings of asset backed securities that rely on the rule a safe harbor  including the trust s private offerings of asset backed securities 
as currently proposed  sec regulation ab ii would  among other things  alter the safe harbor standards for private placements of asset backed securities imposing informational requirements similar to those applicable to registered public offerings 
the final form that sec regulation ab ii may take is uncertain at this time  but it may impact wfb s ability and or desire to sponsor securitization transactions in the future 
on march   pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  the sec  the federal reserve  the fdic  and certain other federal agencies issued proposed regulations requiring securitization sponsors to retain an economic interest in assets that they securitize 
subject to certain exceptions  the proposed regulations would generally require the sponsor of a securitization transaction to retain at least of the credit risk of the securitized assets and would provide securitization sponsors with a number of options for satisfying this requirement 
each of these options would require the sponsor to provide certain disclosures to investors a reasonable time prior to sale and upon request to the sec and the sponsor s applicable federal banking regulator 
in addition  the sponsor would be subject to certain prohibitions on hedging  transferring  or financing the retained credit risk 
if adopted  the proposed regulations will likely affect most types of private securitization transactions  including those sponsored by wfb 
it is not clear how the final regulations will differ from the proposed regulations  if at all  or the impact of the final regulations on wfb and its ability and willingness to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding 
on january   under provisions of the reform act  the sec adopted rules that require issuers of asset backed securities to disclose demand  repurchase  and replacement information through the periodic filing of a new form with the sec 
one of these rules  rule g under the securities exchange act of  as amended  requires rating agencies to disclose in any report accompanying a credit rating for an asset backed security the representations  warranties  and enforcement mechanisms available to investors and how they differ from those in similar securities 
also pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec issued rules that require issuers of asset backed securities to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third party due diligence report obtained by the issuer 
impact of change in accounting principles in the accounting guidance on consolidations and accounting for transfers of financial assets and the criteria for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity resulted in the consolidation of the trust effective january   which resulted in an increase in total assets and liabilities of billion and billion  respectively  and a decrease in retained earnings and other comprehensive income of million  after tax

bank asset quality delinquencies and non accrual we consider the entire balance of an account  including any accrued interest and fees  delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date 
our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment 
as part of collection efforts  a credit card loan may be closed and placed on non accrual or restructured in a fixed payment plan prior to charge off 
our fixed payment plans consist of a lower interest rate  reduced minimum payment  and elimination of fees 
loans on fixed payment plans include loans in which the customer has engaged a consumer credit counseling agency to assist them in managing their debt 
non accrual loans with two consecutive missed payments will resume accruing interest at the rate they had accrued at before they were placed on non accrual 
payments received on non accrual loans will be applied to principal and reduce the amount of the loan 
the following table shows delinquent  non accrual  and restructured loans as a percentage of our credit card loans  including any accrued interest and fees  at the years ended number of days delinquent and still accruing greater than days greater than days greater than days non accrual restructured excluded from percentages above the following table reports delinquencies  including any delinquent non accrual and restructured credit card loans  as a percentage of our credit card loans  including any accrued interest and fees  in a manner consistent with our monthly external reporting for the years ended number of days delinquent greater than days greater than days greater than days delinquencies declined as a result of improvements in the economic environment and our conservative underwriting criteria and active account management 
allowance for loan losses and charge offs the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
loans on a payment plan or non accrual are segmented from the rest of the credit card loan portfolio into a restructured credit card loan segment before establishing an allowance for loan losses as these loans have a higher probability of loss 
management estimates losses inherent in the credit card loans segment and restructured credit card loans segment based on a model which tracks historical loss experience on delinquent accounts  bankruptcies  death  and charge offs  net of estimated recoveries 
wfb uses a migration analysis and historical bankruptcy and death rates to estimate the likelihood that a credit card loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
this analysis estimates the gross amount of principal that will be charged off over the next twelve months  net of recoveries 
this estimate is used to derive an estimated allowance for loan losses 
in addition to these methods of measurement  management also considers other factors such as general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit concentration  changes in origination and portfolio management  and credit quality trends 
since the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a high degree of uncertainty  the measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk  and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
charge offs consist of the uncollectible principal  interest  and fees on a customer s account 
recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged off accounts 
most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at days 
wfb charges off credit card loans and restructured credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum days contractually delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths  and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier 
wfb records charged off cardholder fees and accrued interest receivable directly against interest and fee income included in financial services revenue 
the following table shows the activity in our allowance for loan losses and charge off activity for the years ended dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year change in allowance for loan losses upon consolidation of the trust provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries net charge offs balance  end of year net charge offs on securitized credit card loans net charge offs on credit card loans charge offs of accrued interest and fees recorded as a reduction in interest and fee income total net charge offs including accrued interest and fees net charge offs including accrued interest and fees as a percentage of average credit card loans for  net charge offs as a percentage of our average credit card loans decreased to  down basis points compared to for we believe our charge off levels remain well below industry averages 
our net charge off rates and allowance for loan losses have decreased due to improved outlooks in the quality of our credit card portfolio evidenced by lower delinquencies and delinquency roll rates and favorable charge off trends 
aging of credit cards loans outstanding the quality of our credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects  among other factors the creditworthiness of cardholders  general economic conditions  the success of our account management and collection activities  and the life cycle stage of the portfolio 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies and net charge offs are more likely to increase 
we have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy

we evaluate the credit markets for certificates of deposit and securitizations to determine the most cost effective source of funds for our financial services business segment 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents held by one of our foreign subsidiaries totaled million 
our intent is to permanently reinvest a portion of these funds outside the united states for capital expansion  and to repatriate a portion of these funds 
based on our current projected capital needs and the current amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries  we do not anticipate incurring any material tax costs beyond our accrued tax position in connection with any repatriation  but we may be required to accrue for unanticipated additional tax costs in the future if our expectations or the amount of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries change 
on october   the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of currency  the fdic  and the sec issued proposed regulations implementing certain provisions under the reform act limiting proprietary trading and sponsorship or investment in hedge funds and private equity funds the volcker rule 
the proposed regulations are complex and have been the subject of extensive comment 
as proposed  these regulations may apply to us and could limit our ability to engage in the types of transactions covered by the volcker rule and may impose potentially burdensome compliance  monitoring  and reporting obligations 
there remains considerable uncertainty regarding whether the final regulations implementing the volcker rule will differ from the proposed regulations  and the effect of any final regulations on our retail and direct businesses and wfb 
retail and direct business segments the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management information systems and infrastructure  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new retail stores  and general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments when developing new retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds  and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
the cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from april through november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets 
while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which could result in reduced revenue and profits 
on november   we entered into a new credit agreement providing for a million revolving credit facility that replaced our million credit facility set to expire june  the unsecured million revolving credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit up to million and swing line loans up to million 
this credit facility may be increased to million subject to certain terms and conditions 
the term of the credit facility expires on november  advances under the credit facility will be used for the company s general business purposes  including working capital support 
our unsecured million revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a leverage ratio  and a minimum consolidated net worth standard 
in the event that we failed to comply with these covenants  a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable 
at december   and january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through at least the next months 
our million canadian dollars cad unsecured revolving credit facility is for our operations in canada and expires june  the credit facility permits the issuance of up to million cad in letters of credit  which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility 
financial services business segment the primary cash requirements of wfb relate to the financing of credit card loans 
these cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders balances or spending increase 
wfb sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities  which include funding obtained from securitization transactions  obtaining brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowing under its federal funds purchase agreements  and generating cash from operations 
during  wfb issued million in certificates of deposit  renewed its million variable funding facility for an additional three years  entered into two new variable funding facilities for million and million that will mature in march and september  respectively  and completed two million term securitizations that will mature in march and september  respectively 
in  wfb intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and additional term securitizations 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb s foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
wfb is prohibited by regulations from lending money to cabela s or other affiliates 
wfb is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking law and the visa usa  inc visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by nebraska and federal banking law 
if there are any disruptions in the credit markets  our financial services business  like many other financial institutions  may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with fewer funds available or at unattractive rates 
our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels 
wfb is classified as a well capitalized bank  the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
if wfb were to be classified as an adequately capitalized bank  which is the next level category down from well capitalized  we would be required to obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to continue to issue certificates of deposit 
we will invest additional capital in wfb  if necessary  in order for wfb to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well capitalized classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in addition to the non brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations  we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes 
the ability of our financial services business to engage in securitization transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events  which could materially affect our business and cause our financial services business to lose an important source of capital 
the reform act  which was signed into law in july  will also affect a number of significant changes relating to asset backed securities  including additional oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies and additional reporting and disclosure requirements 
the changes resulting from the reform act may impact our profitability  require changes to certain of wfb s business practices  impose upon wfb more stringent capital  liquidity  and leverage ratio requirements  increase fdic deposit insurance premiums  or otherwise adversely affect wfb s business 
these changes may also require wfb to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 
on september   the fdic approved a final rule that  subject to certain conditions  preserved the safe harbor treatment for legal isolation of transferred assets applicable to certain grandfathered revolving trusts and master trusts that had issued at least one series of asset backed securities as of such date  which we believe included the trust 
the final rule imposes significant new conditions on the availability of the safe harbor with respect to securitizations that are not grandfathered 
in addition  several rules and regulations have recently been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset backed securities 
on september   the sec proposed a new rule under the securities act of  as amended  to implement certain provisions of the reform act 
under the proposed rule  an underwriter  placement agent  initial purchaser  or sponsor of an asset backed security  or any affiliate of any such person  shall not at any time within one year after the first closing of the sale of the asset backed security  engage in any transaction that would involve or result in any material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in a transaction arising out of such activity 
the proposed rule would exempt certain risk mitigating hedging activities  liquidity commitments  and bona fide market making activity 
it is not clear how the final rule will differ from the proposed rule  if at all 
the final rule s impact on the securitization market and wfb is also unclear at this time 
the trust is structured to come within the exemption from the investment company act provided by investment company act rule a on august   the sec issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible amendments to investment company act rule a at this time  it is uncertain what form the related proposed and final rules will take  whether the trust would continue to be eligible to rely on the exemption provided by investment company act rule a  and whether the trust would qualify for any other investment company act exemption 
on july   the sec re proposed certain rules for asset backed securities offerings sec regulation ab ii which were originally proposed by the sec on april  if adopted  sec regulation ab ii would substantially change the disclosure  reporting  and offering process for private offerings of asset backed securities that rely on the rule a safe harbor  including the trust s private offerings of asset backed securities 
as currently proposed  sec regulation ab ii would  among other things  alter the safe harbor standards for private placements of asset backed securities imposing informational requirements similar to those applicable to registered public offerings 
the final form that sec regulation ab ii may take is uncertain at this time  but it may impact wfb s ability and or desire to sponsor securitization transactions in the future 
on march   pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  the sec  the federal reserve  the fdic  and certain other federal agencies issued proposed regulations requiring securitization sponsors to retain an economic interest in assets that they securitize 
subject to certain exceptions  the proposed regulations would generally require the sponsor of a securitization transaction to retain at least of the credit risk of the securitized assets and would provide securitization sponsors with a number of options for satisfying this requirement 
each of these options would require the sponsor to provide certain disclosures to investors a reasonable time prior to sale and upon request to the sec and the sponsor s applicable federal banking regulator 
in addition  the sponsor would be subject to certain prohibitions on hedging  transferring  or financing the retained credit risk 
if adopted  the proposed regulations will likely affect most types of private securitization transactions  including those sponsored by wfb 
it is not clear how the final regulations will differ from the proposed regulations  if at all  or the impact of the final regulations on wfb and its ability and willingness to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding 
on january   under provisions of the reform act  the sec adopted rules that require issuers of asset backed securities to disclose demand  repurchase  and replacement information through the periodic filing of a new form with the sec 
one of these rules requires rating agencies to disclose in any report accompanying a credit rating for an asset backed security the representations  warranties  and enforcement mechanisms available to investors and how they differ from those in similar securities 
also pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec issued rules that require issuers of registered asset backed securities to perform a review of the assets underlying the securities and to publicly disclose information relating to the review 
these rules also require issuers of asset backed securities to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third party due diligence report obtained by the issuer 
it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the january   rules or any other final rules adopted by the sec will impact wfb and its ability and willingness to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding

in addition  our unsecured senior notes contain various covenants and restrictions that are usual and customary for transactions of this type

interest remains variable  is computed at rates which are defined in the agreement plus a margin  and is payable monthly 
all other terms of the credit agreement remained unchanged 
versus operating activities cash derived from operating activities decreased million in compared to this net decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to inventory growth from the new retail store in grand junction  colorado  and from more merchandise on hand than at the end of as we were focused on maintaining sufficient core inventory heading into inventory increased million in  to a balance of million  compared to a decrease of million in  or to a balance of million 
wfb paid cash out on a net basis of million for credit card loans originated at cabela s through our retail and direct businesses 
current and deferred income taxes payable decreased million compared to  partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest of million and in current and deferred income taxes recoverable of million comparing to these net decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in the provision for loan losses 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to in  wfb purchased united states government agency securities totaling million which matured during fiscal in addition  wfb disbursed cash on a net basis for credit card loans originated externally at third parties totaling million in in  wfb retained asset backed securities totaling million from the million series i issuance of the trust and purchased triple a rated notes for million from a previously issued series of the trust 
cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled million in compared to million in at january   we estimated total capital expenditures for the development  construction  and completion of retail stores  including the purchase of economic development bonds  to approximate million through the next months 
financing activities cash used in financing activities decreased million in compared to this net decrease was primarily due to the repaying of million of secured variable funding trust obligations in we also had a decrease of million in the change related to unpresented checks 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in time deposits  which wfb utilizes to fund its credit card operations  of million in compared to a net decrease of million in also  borrowings on our lines of credit for working capital and inventory financing increased million in compared to at the end of and  there were no amounts outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
economic development bonds and grants in the past  we have negotiated economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores  including free land  monetary grants  and the recapture of incremental sales  property  or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
economic development bonds state or local governments may sell economic development bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure  and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our retail stores and certain other property 
in the past  we have primarily been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store or property  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property  or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
some of our bonds may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   and january   economic development bonds totaled million and million  respectively 
grants we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open  typically phase out over approximately five to ten years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
at december   and january   the total amount of grant funding subject to specific contractual remedies was million and million  respectively 
securitization of credit card loans our financial services business historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
wfb utilizes the trust for the purpose of routinely selling and securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors 
the trust issues variable funding facilities and long term notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
wfb must retain a minimum day average of of the loans in the securitization trust which ranks pari passu with the investors interests in the securitization trusts 
in addition  wfb owns notes issued by the trust from some of the securitizations  which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued 
wfb s retained interests are eliminated upon consolidation of the trust 
the consolidated assets of the trust are subject to credit  payment  and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loans 
the credit card loans of the trust are restricted for the repayment of the secured borrowings of the trust 
to protect investors  the securitization structures include certain features that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the securities  which could cause wfb to sustain a loss of one or more of its retained interests and could prompt the need for wfb to seek alternative sources of funding 
the primary investor protection feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of loans to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
wfb refers to this as the early amortization feature 
investors are allocated cash flows derived from activities related to the accounts comprising the securitized pool of loans  the amounts of which reflect finance charges collected  certain fee assessments collected  allocations of interchange  and recoveries on charged off accounts 
these cash flows are considered to be restricted under the governing documents to pay interest to investors  servicing fees  and to absorb the investor s share of charge offs occurring within the securitized pool of loans 
any cash flows remaining in excess of these requirements are reported to investors as excess spread 
an excess spread of less than zero percent for a contractually specified period  generally a three month average  would trigger an early amortization event 
such an event could result in wfb incurring losses related to its retained interests 
in addition  if wfb s retained interest in the loans falls below the minimum day average and wfb fails to add new accounts to the securitized pool of loans  an early amortization event would be triggered 
the investors have no recourse to wfb s other assets for failure of debtors to pay other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities do not protect the trust or third party investors against credit related losses on the loans 
another feature  which is applicable to the notes issued from the trust  is one in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loans are held at the trust for the benefit of the investors 
this cash reserve account funding is triggered when the three month average excess spread rate of the trust decreases to below or depending on the series with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels or as contractually required by the governing documents 
similar to early amortization  this feature also is designed to protect the investors interests from loss thus making the cash restricted 
upon scheduled maturity or early amortization of a securitization  wfb is required to remit principal payments received on the securitized pool of loans to the trust which are restricted for the repayment of the investors principal note 
the total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of december   were as follows total available capacity third party investor available capacity third party investor outstanding interest rate expected maturity series type dollars in thousands series i term fixed march series i term floating march series i term fixed january series i term floating january series ii term fixed september series ii term floating september series ii term fixed june series ii term floating june series iv term fixed october series iv term floating october total term series iii variable funding floating march series i variable funding floating march series iii variable funding floating september total variable total available we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for wfb 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of wfb 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  could have a similar effect 
during  wfb issued million in certificates of deposit  renewed its million variable funding facility for an additional three years  entered into two new variable funding facilities for million and million that will mature in march and september  respectively  and completed two million term securitizations that will mature in march and september  respectively 
in  wfb intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and additional term securitizations 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb s foreseeable cash requirements  including term debt and certificate of deposit maturities  and near term growth plans 
furthermore  wfb s securitized credit card loans could experience poor performance  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds 
this could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb s securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
credit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the years ended december   and january  certificates of deposit wfb utilizes brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities 
wfb issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities 
at december   wfb had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to december and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
this outstanding balance compares to million at january   with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at december  thereafter total in thousands long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases time deposits by maturity interest payments on time deposits secured long term obligations of the trust interest payments on secured obligations of the trust obligations under retail store arrangements purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain 
includes approximately million of estimated contractual obligations and commitments associated with projected new retail store related expansion 
the table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with retail store locations where we are in the process of certain negotiations 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping  and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or contracts  or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders or contracts under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
amounts for unrecognized tax benefits are not reflected in year through since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty 
the following table provides summary information concerning other commercial commitments at december  in thousands letters of credit standby letters of credit revolving line of credit for boat and atv inventory open account document instructions bank federal funds secured variable funding obligations of the trust total our credit agreement allows for maximum borrowings of million including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
at december   the total amount of borrowings under this revolving line of credit was million  which consisted of lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
our credit agreement for operations in canada is for million cad  of which all was available for borrowing at december  the line of credit for boat and all terrain vehicles financing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed from third party investors on the variable funding facilities is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  distribution  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits wfb bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through wfb s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion above existing balances at december  these funding obligations are not included in our consolidated balance sheet 
while wfb has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders  such an event would create a cash need at wfb which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
wfb has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of cabela s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions 
our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates 
should actual results be different than our estimates  we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that may be material 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our direct sales when merchandise is delivered to the customer at the point of delivery  with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer 
we recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations 
had our estimate of merchandise in transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise or services and as a liability prior to redemption 
we recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote 
had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by of the recorded liability at the end of  our merchandise revenue would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
inventories we estimate provisions for inventory shrinkage  damaged goods returned values  and obsolete and slow moving items based on historical loss and product performance statistics and future merchandising objectives 
had our estimated inventory reserves been different by at the end of  our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
allowance for loan losses on credit cards the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
loans on a payment plan or non accrual are segmented from the rest of the credit card loan portfolio into a restructured credit card loan segment before establishing an allowance for loan losses as these loans have a higher probability of loss 
management estimates losses inherent in the credit card loans segment and restructured credit card loans segment based on a model which tracks historical loss experience on delinquent accounts  bankruptcies  death  and charge offs  net of estimated recoveries 
wfb uses a migration analysis and historical bankruptcy and death rates to estimate the likelihood that a credit card loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
this analysis estimates the gross amount of principal that will be charged off over the next months  net of recoveries 
this estimate is used to derive an estimated allowance for loan losses 
in addition to these methods of measurement  management also considers other factors such as general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit concentration  changes in origination and portfolio management  and credit quality trends 
since the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a high degree of uncertainty  the measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk  and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for example  had management s estimate of net losses over the next months been different by at the end of  wfb s allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses would have changed by approximately million 
credit card loans that have been modified through a fixed payment plan or placed on non accrual are considered impaired and are collectively evaluated for impairment 
wfb charges off credit card loans and restructured credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum days contractually delinquent 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths  and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier 
wfb recognizes charged off cardholder fees and accrued interest receivable in interest and fee income that is included in financial services revenue 
long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets  which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows or quoted market prices 
we recognize an impairment loss if the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios 
we have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
economic development bonds we recognize economic development bond investments based on estimates of the discounted future cash payments to be received under these bonds 
these estimates are also the basis for our recognition of deferred grant revenue to be received under the economic development grants as an offset to construction costs which is amortized over the asset lives of the development 
these cash flow estimates are dependent on property and or sales tax collections derived from our operations  and in certain cases  other businesses in that respective jurisdiction 
had our fair value estimates been lower by as of the end of  the value of economic development bonds reflected in our consolidated financial statements would have been approximately million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income loss if the loss was deemed to be temporary 
any declines in the fair value available for sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others 
this statement requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers 
it also requires the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within level on a gross basis rather than a net basis 
the amendments also clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
these disclosures about fair value measurements and the requirement concerning gross presentation of level activity are presented in note the adoption of this statement had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
asu no 
enhances the existing disclosure requirements providing more transparency of the allowance for loan losses and credit quality of financing receivables 
the disclosures relating to information as of the end of a reporting period and to activity occurring during the reporting period are presented in note effective april   the fasb issued asu no 
 a creditor s determination of whether restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring  which clarifies when a loan modification or restructuring is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
this guidance clarifies what constitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  even if not currently in default 
an entity should disclose the total amount of receivables and the allowance for credit losses as of the end of the period of adoption related to those receivables that are newly considered impaired 
the amendments in asu were effective for the third quarter of fiscal for the company  and were applied retrospectively to modifications occurring on or after the beginning of fiscal year the adoption of the provisions of this asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
effective june   the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income  requiring entities to report components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
this asu does not change the items that must be reported in comprehensive income  how these items are measured  or when these items must be classified to net income 
asu is effective for financial statements issued by the company after january  effective december   the fasb issued asu  which indefinitely deferred  pending further deliberation by the fasb at a future date  the effective date of certain provisions of asu relating to the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we will provide the required financial reporting presentation in the company s first fiscal quarter of effective september   the fasb issued asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  which gives companies testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test 
if companies determine  based on qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   or effective for the first quarter of for the company  with early adoption permitted 
the value of our goodwill will not be affected by the adoption of the provisions of this asu 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through wfb s operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on credit card loans and interest expense on certificates of deposit and secured borrowings do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  earnings could be affected 
the variable rate credit card loans are indexed to the one month london interbank offered rate libor and the credit card portfolio is segmented into risk based pricing tiers each with a different interest margin 
variable rate secured borrowings are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificates of deposit and fixed rate secured borrowings are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by indexing the customer rates to the same index as our cost of funds 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing  and mix of fixed and variable assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate secured borrowings or certificates of deposit and entering into interest rate swaps 
the table below shows the mix of our credit card account balances as a percentage of total balances outstanding at the years ended balances carrying an interest rate based upon various interest rate indices balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying a promotional interest rate of balances not carrying interest because the previous month balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment were priced at a margin over various defined lending rates 
no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle  which represented of total balances outstanding at december  some of the zero percentage promotion expenses are passed through to the merchandise vendors for each specific promotion offered 
management has performed several interest rate risk analyses to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on these analyses  we believe that an immediate decrease of basis points  or  in libor interest charged to customers and on our cost of funds would cause a pre tax decrease to earnings of million for our financial services segment over the next twelve months 
merchandising business interest rate risk the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily u 
s 
dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the u 
s 
dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs 
for our operations in canada  we intend to fund all transactions in canadian dollars and utilize our unsecured revolving credit agreement of million cad to fund such operations as well as the utilization of cash held by our foreign subsidiary
