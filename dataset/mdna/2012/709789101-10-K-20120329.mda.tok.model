application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses all represents management s best estimate of identified and inherent losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
adequacy of the all is evaluated no less than quarterly 
determining the amount of the all is difficult and calls for numerous subjective judgments as it relies on estimates of inherent loss on individual loans  the effects of portfolio trends due to evolving market conditions  and other internal and external factors 
the all consists of formula based reserves for inherent losses in the balances of specific segments of the loan portfolio  specific reserve amounts for inherent losses on loans management has identified as impaired  and unallocated reserves not associated with a specific loan or portfolio segment 
the bank evaluates loan portfolio risk for the purpose of establishing an adequate all 
management considers historical loss experience for all segments of the loan portfolio in order to determine an adequate level for the formula based portion of the all 
different segments of the loan portfolio are evaluated based on loss experience using a month rolling historical loss ratio 
based on this evaluation  management applies a formula to current portfolio balances in the different portfolio segments  giving weight to portfolio segment size and loss experience for real estate construction and land development loans  other real estate secured loans  other loans to commercial borrowers and other personal loans to consumers 
historical data may not present a complete prediction of loss potential in the current loan portfolio 
bearing this in mind  management also evaluates trends in delinquencies  lending volume  and changes in lending practices and policies 
management further considers external factors such as current local and national economic conditions and trends  reviews by independent loan review vendors  reviews by our outside auditors  and the results of examinations by bank regulatory authorities 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included below under the caption financial condition market risk management 
results of operations we reported a net loss of  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  basic and diluted net loss per share for the years ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
the higher loss in  or when compared to was the direct result of a  increase in our provision for loan losses in to  from  in the increased provision was due primarily to increased losses in our loan portfolio during net interest income the primary source of our income is net interest income  which is the difference between revenue on interest earning assets  such as investment securities and loans  and interest incurred on interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balance of interest earning assets and funding sources and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing funding sources 
the table average balances  interest  and yields that appears below shows our average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for and  and related income expense and yields 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and increases or decreases in the average rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is affected by the ability to manage the earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 
the table analysis of changes in net interest income shows the amount of net interest income change from rate changes and from volume changes 
for the year ended december   net interest income decreased  or  to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income in was the result of a  decrease in interest income offset by a  decrease in interest expense 
in  deposits increased but our borrowed funds decreased with loan demand 
net interest income decreased because the yield earned on loans declined faster than yields on deposits and borrowed funds 
the yield on interest earning assets on a fully taxable equivalent basis was in and in  with the combined effective rate on deposits and borrowed funds following the same fluctuation by decreasing from in to in the key performance measure for net interest income is the net margin on interest earning assets  or net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
our net interest margin for and on a fully taxable equivalent basis was and  respectively 
management attempts to maintain a net margin on interest earning assets of or higher 
the net margin may decline  however  if competition increases  loan demand decreases  or the cost of funds rises faster or declines slower than the return on loans and securities 
although such expectations are based on management s judgment  actual results will depend on a number of factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  and fulfillment of management s expectations cannot be assured

deposit balances increased during this period and interest expense decreased as the direct result of lower interest rates for the period and the repricing of matured time deposits at lower rates 
comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  interest revenue decreased  with  of this decrease resulting from a decrease in loan interest expense 
interest expense decreased  with  of this decrease resulting from a decrease in borrowed funds interest expense

we have reduced those expenses that are under management s control and constantly attempts to increase overall income 
financial condition assets total assets increased to  at december  when compared to assets at december  average total assets for were  an increase of 
from the loan portfolio represented of average earning assets in  compared to in  and was the primary source of income for the company 
funding for loans is provided primarily by core deposits  securities repurchase agreements  and fhlb borrowings 
total deposits increased to  at december  when compared to composition of loan portfolio because loans are expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets assuming that loan losses are not excessive  the absolute volume of loans and the volume as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin 
average loans  net of the allowance for loan losses  were  and  for and  respectively  which constituted and of average interest earning assets for the respective years

the bank also borrows from correspondent banks and the fhlb to fund loans 
our ratio of average loans to average deposits plus average borrowed funds was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  we extend loans primarily to customers located in and near kent county  queen anne s county and cecil county in maryland 
there are no industry concentrations in our loan portfolio 
a substantial portion of our loans are  however  secured by real estate and  accordingly  the real estate market in the region will influence the performance of our loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at december  and composition of loan portfolio percent percent amount of total amount of total commercial   real estate residential   real estate commercial   construction   consumer   total loans   deferred costs  net of deferred fees   allowance for loan losses   net loans   the following table sets forth the maturity distribution  classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates  for selected components of our loan portfolio at december  loan maturity schedule and sensitivity to changes in interest rates december  one year or less over one through five over five years total commercial     real estate residential    real estate commercial   construction    consumer     total     fixed interest rate    variable interest rate   total     at december    or  of the total loans were either variable rate loans or loans written on demand 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of our customers  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
we generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments that we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further information about these commitments 
loan quality the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due  and other loans that management believes require attention 
the determination of the reserve level rests upon management s judgment about factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economy 
management considers the year end allowance appropriate and adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio  however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required 
for significant problem loans  management s review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrowers and guarantors  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
the overall evaluation of the adequacy of the total allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan charge offs  delinquency trends  and previous collection experience  along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
risk elements of loan portfolio for the years ended december  non accrual loans   accruing loans past due days or more   during the previous year management reevaluated how loans were placed in a nonaccrual status 
as the result loans are now placed in nonaccrual at the time they reach days past due unless management s review of the loan determines the collateral is sufficient to discharge the debt in full or the loan is in the process of collection 
the following table  allocation of allowance for loan losses  shows the specific allowance applied by loan type and also the general allowance included in the allowance for loan losses at december  and commercial   residential real estate   commercial real estate   construction and land development   other real estate   consumer   overdraft   unallocated   total   the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate 
the provision for loan losses was  in  which represents an increase of  over the  that was recorded in we added to our reserves in anticipation of inherent losses in connection with the higher than normal balances of nonaccrual loans 
the following table shows information about the allowance for loan losses for each of the last two years allowance for loan losses year ended year ended december  december  balance at beginning of year   loans charged off commercial   mortgages   consumer   total loan losses   recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial   mortgages  consumer   total loan recoveries   net loan losses   provision for loan losses charged to expense  balance at end of year   allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding net charge offs to average loans as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis 
loans may be placed on non accrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest is ninety days past due or when the loan is determined to be impaired  unless collateral is sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in process of collection 
when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest that had been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
we had nonperforming loans of  and  at december  and  respectively 
management considers the nonaccrual loans and loans over days past due to be nonperforming loans 
we had  and  in foreclosed other real estate at december  and  respectively 
after our borrowers default  we acquire real estate securing our loans either by taking title by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure 
the real estate is placed in foreclosed other real estate after we take title 
during  the bank added a large parcel valued at approximately  to foreclosed other real estate 
foreclosed other real estate is considered part of non performing assets 
investment securities our security portfolio is categorized as available for sale and held to maturity 
investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for liquidity purposes as part of our overall asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  net of applicable income taxes 
we do not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view of near term resales and  therefore  do not own any securities classified as trading securities 
management intends to hold investment securities classified as held to maturity until they mature 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
for additional information about the investment portfolio  see note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
the following table sets forth the maturities of the investment portfolio as of december  available for sale held to maturity amortized fair amortized fair december  cost value cost value maturing within one year 
  over one to five years   mortgage backed securities   pledged securities   liquidity management liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
the funds invested in federal funds sold also provide liquidity  as do lines of credit  overnight federal funds  and reverse repurchase agreements available from correspondent banks 
the aggregate amount available from correspondent banks under all lines of credit at december  was  the bank has a partially funded line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta under which it may borrow up to  through any combination of notes or line of credit advances 
as of december   the bank had borrowed  as line of credit advances 
the bank was required to purchase shares of capital stock in the fhlb as a condition to obtaining the line of credit 
this line is secured by the bank s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
additionally  the bank has a secured line of credit with the federal reserve discount window under which it may borrow approximately average liquid assets cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other banks  federal funds sold  and investment securities available for sale were of average deposits for  compared to for we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is primarily dependent on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the degree to which these different assets mature or reprice is known as interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of net interest income 
to lessen the impact of these margin swings  the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
interest rate sensitivity may be controlled on either side of the balance sheet 
on the asset side  management can exercise some control on maturities 
also  loans may be structured with rate floors and ceilings on variable rate notes and by providing for repricing opportunities on fixed rate notes 
our available for sale investment portfolio  including federal funds sold  provides the most flexible and fastest control over rate sensitivity since it can generally be restructured more quickly than the loan portfolio 
on the liability side  deposit products can be restructured so as to offer incentives to attain the maturity distribution desired 
competitive factors sometimes make control over deposits more difficult and less effective 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at a given time interval 
the general objective of gap management is to actively manage rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest margin 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize our overall interest rate risk 
several aspects of the asset mix of the balance sheet are continually evaluated yield  credit quality  appropriate funding sources  and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
the interest rate sensitivity position at december  is presented in the table interest sensitivity analysis 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
we were asset sensitive for the three month  twelve month and over five year time horizons and liability sensitive in the after one year and within five year time horizon 
for asset sensitive institutions  if interest rates should decrease  the net interest margins should decline 
because all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  the gap is only a general indicator of rate sensitivity

our core deposits increased  during  primarily due to competitor s branch closing in our service area 
in the past  deposits  particularly core deposits  have been our primary source of funding and have enabled us to meet our short term liquidity needs 
in recent years  we have borrowed from correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta to meet liquidity needs 
the maturity distribution of our time deposits over  at december  is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more december  within three months after three through six months after six through months after months total certificates of deposit  or more     large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rates  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits are generally expensive and are unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not typically purchase brokered deposits 
the average balance of borrowings decreased  or  in when compared to the average balance of borrowings decreased  or  in the decrease in when compared to was due primarily to the fact that loan demand has reduced and we were able to reduce our lines of credit  particularly at the fhlb of atlanta  during short term borrowings the following table sets forth our position with respect to short term borrowings for each of the last two years ended december amount rate amount rate at year end repurchase agreements   average for the year retail repurchase agreements   federal funds purchased maximum month end balance retail repurchase agreements   federal funds purchased  the bank may borrow up to approximately  from the fhlb of atlanta through any combination of notes or line of credit advances

we provide collateral of of the repurchase agreement balances by pledging us government agency securities 
the bank has lines of credit of  in unsecured overnight federal funds and  in secured overnight federal funds with correspondent banks at december  the bank has a secured line of credit with the federal reserve discount window of approximately capital under the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb and the fdic  the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios

the table below compares the capital ratios of the bank with the regulatory minimums 
the company s only assets in other than its equity interest in the bank were its equity interest in the insurance subsidiary and a small amount of cash

the significant accounting policies used by the company and the bank are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb adopted accounting standards codification asc as the officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  the emerging issues task force eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the asc affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies

disclosures must be disaggregated by portfolio segment  the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic method for determining its allowance for credit losses  and class of financing receivable  which is generally a disaggregation of portfolio segment 
the required disclosures include  among other things  a roll forward of the allowance for credit losses as well as information about modified  impaired  non accrual and past due loans and credit quality indicators

asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist such as if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
asu became effective for the company on january  asu no 
 receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings and is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude  under the guidance clarified by asu  that both of the following exist i the restructuring constitutes a concession  and ii the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
asu will be effective for the company on july   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after january  asu no
