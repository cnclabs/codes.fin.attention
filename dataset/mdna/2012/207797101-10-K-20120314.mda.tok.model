item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 
competition connecticut water faces competition from a few small privately owned water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas 
employees as of december   we employed a total of persons 
our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
organizational review as part of a broader organizational review  beginning in july  the company examined both its connecticut regulated and unregulated operations to ensure that it is maximizing the company s financial results while maintaining the high quality water and service our customers have come to expect 
during the third quarter of  the company determined that a targeted reduction in workforce was appropriate 
the company eliminated approximately positions that centered on traditional managerial  officer and overhead positions 
the company did not eliminate positions in direct service of its customers 
the company recorded a one time charge of approximately  related to this organizational review 
this charge represents the aggregate severance benefit provided to the employees leaving the company and other costs associated with the review

water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water companies with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
through land donations and sales in previous years  the company earned tax credits to use in future years 
the company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits 
during  the company completed the sale of a conservation easement of approximately acres to the town of windsor locks  ct 
additionally  the company made adjustments to tax valuation allowances associated with land donations made in previous years 
finally  chester realty sold a non regulated rental property in killingly  ct for a small profit 
during and  the company did not make any land sales or donations  however  it did adjust its valuation allowances 
the company is finalizing a land sale with the town of plymouth  connecticut to sell approximately acres of land for open space and recreational purposes  pending the approval of a conservation easement by the state of connecticut attorney general s office 
the company and town have agreed on a sale price of million for the parcel that is valued at million 
the company expects the transaction to be completed in 
table of contents a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the company to eligible residential customers through newus covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide drinking water to a customer s home 
for customers who enroll in this program  the company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line  curb box  curb box cover  meter pit  meter pit cover  meter pit valve plus in home water main shut off valve before the meter 
beginning in january with the acquisition of certain assets from home service usa  newus expanded its coverage offerings to connecticut water customers for failure of in home plumbing and sewer and septic drainage lines 
in the company launched a successful marketing campaign prompting over  existing linebacker customers to upgrade to one of the expanded offerings 
as of december   the company had  customers enrolled in its linebacker protection program 
of these   were enrolled in one of the expanded plans 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while still a relatively small portion of our overall business  has grown over the past five years and has provided approximately of our overall net income in  and  respectively 
net income generated by this segment of our business was   and  for the years  and  respectively 
item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers  which are subject to regulation 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the pura in connecticut and the mpuc in maine 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses 
once a rate increase petition is filed with the respective agency  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by each agency  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  a regulatory agency may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a connecticut law  the pura may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  known as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
for more information related to wica  please refer to the executive overview found in item of this form k 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due  or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december   we had million in long term debt outstanding and million in bank loans payable 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to the company as current terms 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt 
during certain periods of the unites states credit and liquidity crisis of  the volatility and disruption in the credit and banking markets reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers  and lenders had requested shorter terms 
the market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all 
in addition  the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments 
the company noted improvements beginning during the second half of and continuing through if market disruption and volatility return  the company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due  draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt  which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms  or at all 

table of contents failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
since  standard poor s ratings services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary the connecticut water company 
their evaluations are based on a number of factors  which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
on october   standard poor s ratings services s p affirmed its a corporate credit rating on the company  however  s p revised the company s ratings outlook from stable to negative 
the negative outlook reflected s p s expectation of weaker credit metrics as a result of the debt the company planned to incur to complete the acquisition of am as well as additional near term debt funding of the company s capital expenditure program 
s p also indicated that if the company were to issue a material amount of common equity in the future  this step could lead s p to revise the outlook to stable 
our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations 
we are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements 
failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default  which if not timely cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date  could limit future borrowings  and result in cross default issues and increase borrowing costs 
the covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
as detailed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may affect investment returns  which may fall below the company s projected return rates 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value 
additionally  the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements 
further  changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
also  future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers  and the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states  the state of connecticut and or the state of maine 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that either the pura or the mpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to fully recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
climate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives 
additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide 
many scientists  legislators  and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
possible new climate change laws and regulations  if enacted  may require us to monitor and or change our utility operations 
it is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs 
because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted  we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that either the pura or the mpuc or other regulatory bodies that govern our business would permit us to recover such expenditures and costs 
we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
new streamflow regulations could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers 
in december  new regulations concerning the flow of water in connecticut s rivers and streams became law 
these regulations were initially proposed by the department of energy and environmental protection deep in  and were twice rejected by the state legislature s regulations review committee 
following the last rejection  deep worked closely with stakeholders to develop regulations that were not opposed by the regulated community 
as promulgated  the regulations will require that certain downstream releases be made from seven of the company s eighteen active reservoirs no later than ten years following the adoption of stream classifications  which has yet to occur 
currently  releases are made at two locations 
no groundwater supply wells are affected by the regulations 
although significantly and favorably modified from prior versions  the regulations still have the potential to lower our safe yield  raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
because they affect only a subset of the company s supplies and allow for releases to be scaled back in response to drought events  however  the overall impact is anticipated to be manageable 
costs associated with the regulations may be recovered in the form of higher rates  although there can be no assurance the pura would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
the deep has recently proposed legislation that would expand the current wica mechanism to allow for customer surcharges to recover the costs associated with the capital improvements necessary to achieve compliance with the streamflow regulations 

table of contents our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut and maine has been observed for the last several years  which we would attribute to increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the pura in connecticut and the mpuc in maine and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and or secure new sources  as required 
insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although not occurring in  drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
with the implementation of the company s new enterprise resource planning erp system  the company delayed customer billings in order to verify the integrity of the system and the accuracy of those bills prior to mailing 
as a result  some billings and consequently  cash receipts were delayed 
the company has increased its utilization of its lines of credit during this period 
its operations  including plans to continue investment in new infrastructure  are not impacted 
during  the company has seen progress towards resolving the collection issues  primarily through the ability to charge interest and shut off customers for non payment and expects continued improvement throughout the company fully anticipates that the reserve will return to more historical levels during the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own and operate numerous dams throughout the states of connecticut and maine 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water and maine water distribute water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut and maine 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the pura and the mpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
as of the date of this filing  connecticut water now serves more than  customers  or a population of over  people  in connecticut towns and an additional  customers  representing over  people  in towns in the state of maine served by maine water 
we will be unable to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses  including maine water  could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management s time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 

table of contents some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 
water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to possible contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
on january   connecticut water issued a do not drink advisory to year round customers in the amston lake water system when elevated levels of copper were detected in samples from some customers homes 
while there was not a violation of any state or federal water quality standard  copper levels in samples from some customers homes were found above the environmental protection agency epa action level of mg l 
the do not drink advisory was lifted on january  the company is following an action plan approved by the department of public health 
the resulting copper levels have been below the epa action level 
increased security measures may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefit obligations  and possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

unresolved staff comments none item properties at december   the properties of our regulated water company consisted of land  easements  rights including water rights  buildings  reservoirs  standpipes  dams  wells  supply lines  treatment plants  pumping plants  transmission and distribution mains and conduits  mains and other facilities and equipment used for the collection  purification  storage and distribution of water 
in certain cases  connecticut water is or may be a party to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee simple and or land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant of the company at december  was solely owned by connecticut water 
connecticut water s net utility plant balance as of december  was  approximately million more than the balance of net utility plant as of december   due primarily to normal plant additions and construction spending related to infrastructure improvements 

table of contents sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by connecticut water include eighteen reservoirs and ninety one well fields  as of december  in addition  connecticut water has agreements with various neighboring water utilities to provide water  at negotiated rates  to our water systems 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately fifty two million gallons of potable water daily to the thirteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  connecticut water owns  maintains  and operates fifty small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined  have the ability to deliver about two million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system 
as of december   connecticut water owns and operates water filtration facilities  having a combined treatment capacity of approximately million gallons per day 
the company s estimated available water supply  including purchased water agreements  but excluding non principal systems  at december  is as follows system estimated available supply million gallons per day chester system collinsville system danielson system gallup system guilford system naugatuck system northern western system plainfield system stafford system terryville system thomaston system thompson system unionville system total as of december   the transmission and distribution systems of connecticut water consisted of approximately  miles of main 
on that date  approximately percent of our mains were eight inch diameter or larger 
substantially all new main installations are cement lined ductile iron pipe of eight inch diameter or larger 
we believe that our properties are maintained in good condition and in accordance with current regulations and standards of good waterworks industry practice 
item legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings from time to time 
although the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  there are no pending legal proceedings to which we  or any of our subsidiaries are a party  or to which any of our properties is subject  that presents a reasonable likelihood of a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition executive overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its three active wholly owned subsidiary companies  as of december  the connecticut water company connecticut water  new england water utility services  inc newus  and chester realty company chester realty 
additionally  on january   the company completed the acquisition of aqua maine from aqua america 
upon completion of the acquisition  aqua maine renamed the maine water company maine water 
on july   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement on july  with aqua america  inc aa to purchase all of the outstanding shares of aqua maine  inc am  a wholly owned subsidiary of aa  for approximately million subject to certain adjustments at closing  including approximately million of long term debt as of december   reflecting a total enterprise value of approximately million 
am is a public water utility regulated by the maine public utilities commission mpuc that serves approximately  customers in water systems in the state of maine 
the acquisition is consistent with the company s growth strategy and will make the company the largest us based publicly traded water utility company in new england 
the acquisition expanded the company s footprint into another new england state  providing some diversity with respect to weather and regulatory climate and ratemaking 
the company will account for the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards codification asc business combinations 
on november   the mpuc issued an order approving a settlement agreement that gave regulatory approval for the acquisition by the company 
effective january   the company completed the acquisition of am from aa for a total cash purchase price  adjusted at closing  of million 
subsequent to the closing  the name of am was changed to the maine water company maine water 
the company is still in the process of completing the purchase price allocation as required by asc in  approximately of the company s net income was attributable to the water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns  as of december  the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority pura  formerly the connecticut department of public utility control 
in the mid s  connecticut water made a conscious decision to minimize its reliance on rate increase requests to drive its financial performance 
instead  it relied upon unregulated operations and cost containment to grow the earnings of the company without seeking higher rates 
after a successful extended period of meeting these objectives  it became clear in that a rate increase was needed to continue to provide shareholder value through increased earnings 
the company decided to return to the more traditional model of recurring rate increase filings to efficiently collect its cost of both annual expenses and its investment in the infrastructure of the regulated business 
in  connecticut water communicated to its customers  regulators and shareholders that it expected to seek rate relief on a more recurring basis 
recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly  which was adopted in wica allows connecticut water to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the pura and no more than twice a year  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments 
on july   the pura issued its final decision in a rate case filed by connecticut water on january   granting an increase in revenues of million  or approximately  over pro forma test year revenues 
the pura approved a return on equity of 
the new rates became effective for services rendered on or after july   at which point all previously approved wica surcharges were folded into customers base charges

the town was awarded a watershed and open space grant from the connecticut department of environmental protection to assist in purchasing the land 
this transaction will allow the company to receive financial benefit by disposing of property that is no longer needed for public water supply purposes while at the same time supporting environmental stewardship by ensuring the property is permanently maintained as open space

if approved  the company expects the transaction to be completed in regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
our regulated water companies ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
our regulated water utilities are also subject to environmental and water quality regulations  which are continually modified and refined to ensure the safety of the company s water sources and  ultimately  the public s health 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
while there can be no guarantee that all expenditures related to increased regulation will be recoverable in rate proceedings  the company believes that the regulatory environment in connecticut and maine would allow prudent expenditures to be recovered in rates 
to date  the company has never had any costs associated with water quality and environmental spending refused in a general rate proceeding

public utility regulation financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc regulated operations fasb asc  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water and maine water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
the company accrues an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation 
employee benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities
