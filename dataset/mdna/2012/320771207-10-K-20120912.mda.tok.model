item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data included in item of this annual report and financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors included in item a of this annual report 
executive summary overview we are a specialty finance company focused on education loan programs for k  undergraduate and graduate students in the united states  as well as tuition planning  tuition billing  refund management and payment technology services 
since we have focused on providing fee based services which includes our four principal revenue lines partnered lending  banking services  capital market transactions and fee for service 
our products and services help students and families meet their educational financial needs either through our monogram platform or through our tuition payment planning services 
our business model has changed significantly since fiscal as a result of capital markets disruptions 
however  we are focused on continuing to grow and maximize our monogram platform  grow and diversify our fee based revenues  manage risk and retention and capture opportunities within the capital markets 
our financial results are affected by changes in economic and market conditions  competitive conditions within the education loan industry and changes in legislation  regulation and or accounting principles 
while the economic climate has been improving in recent quarters  we are uncertain as to the degree of market acceptance that our monogram platform will achieve and we continue to believe that managing risk and growth is critical to our overall success 
we have taken the following measures since fiscal to adjust our business model  including during fiscal  we designed our monogram platform  including the development and validation of our proprietary origination risk score model  product pricing  an enhanced application interface and additional disbursement and reporting capabilities 
we completed this development during fiscal 
table of contents we continue to incorporate refinements to our monogram platform 
our monogram platform was designed in part to provide us with fee based income as we provide our services  reducing our dependence on the securitization market in order to generate revenue 
we expect to earn monthly service fees  as well as a share of the portfolio income generated over the life of the loans 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we disbursed the first loans based on our monogram platform 
in december  we completed our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms from keybank national association 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed our previously announced review of strategic alternatives for union federal 
after an analysis of a broad range of alternatives by a special committee of independent directors and fmd s financial and legal advisors  we decided to retain our ownership of union federal 
we believe our acquisition of tms  along with our ability to implement our own education loan programs subject to regulatory constraints based on our monogram platform creates potential synergies with union federal 
on june   union federal launched the union federal private student loan program  a monogram based national higher education loan program  and the prepgate loan program  a monogram based national k education loan program  and began accepting applications under these programs as of july  on june   tms sold a portfolio of contracts with low cost  predominately faith based k schools to nelnet business solutions  inc d b a facts management company for a purchase price of million 
on november   we received million in cash upon the sale to a third party of our interests in the structuring advisory agreements relating to the trusts and the related asset services agreement 
as a result of this sale  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of the ncslt trusts as of november  the assets and liabilities that were deconsolidated were included in discontinued assets and liabilities  respectively  in our june  consolidated balance sheet 
the non cash gain of billion recognized at deconsolidation was reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
on november   we entered into an amendment to our loan program agreement with suntrust bank to  among other things  expand and extend our relationship with suntrust bank to  thereby substantially increasing the volume capacity for monogram based education loan originations under the suntrust bank loan program 
on march   fmd sold to a third party all of its outstanding capital stock in its subsidiary fmds for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
fmds serves as the trust administrator of securitization trusts that we previously facilitated 
the operations of fmds were reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
on march   the new third party owner of fmds terminated the agreement  to be effective september   with fmer for the special servicing of the nct trusts 
as a result of the termination of the agreement  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of the gate trusts as of march  the results of the operations of the gate trusts were reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
on april   fmer provided its notice of resignation as special servicer of the trusts 
the resignation became effective june  with this resignation  and the previous transactions noted above  we determined that the previous deconsolidations of the ncslt trusts and the gate trusts as 
table of contents well as the results and operations of fmds would be reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  resulting in financial results that more accurately reflect our current business and are more transparent and understandable to the users of our financial statements 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 
on june   we launched the texas extra credit education loan program with hesc 
based on our monogram platform  the texas extra credit education loan program is a new private education loan program designed specifically for students attending an approved college or university in texas as well as for texas residents attending approved colleges or universities anywhere in the united states 
under the loan program agreement  we will perform a range of services in support of this loan program  including loan processing  portfolio management and program administration services 
during fiscal  we announced our commitment to reduce operating expenses through a million reduction of selected expenses 
of this million  approximately million will be a reduction in compensation and benefits 
we reduced our head count by during the six months ended june   which reduced our overall compensation and benefits costs by approximately million on an annualized basis 
we anticipate that we will be able to realize these projected cost savings during fiscal on august   we announced a new private education loan consolidation program with suntrust bank based on the monogram platform  the suntrust bank private student loan consolidation program 
this program will provide borrowers the opportunity to refinance their existing education loans into one new loan with a single payment and potentially reduce their current monthly payment and interest rate 
approved borrowers will be offered the choice of a fixed or variable interest rate  as well as multiple repayment terms 
loan origination during the first quarter of fiscal  we began performing services for two lender clients related to school certified education loan programs funded by these lender clients based on our monogram platform 
on june   we began performing services for union federal related to school certified education loan programs based on our monogram platform  including a k loan program 
in june  we launched a monogram based loan program with a new lender client and in august  we launched a monogram based loan consolidation program with an existing client 
our monogram platform provides us with an opportunity to originate  administer  manage and finance education loans  and our four lender clients monogram based loan programs are a significant step in our return to the education lending marketplace 
historically  we have processed the greatest loan application volume during the summer and early fall months  as students and their families seek to borrow money in order to pay tuition costs for the fall semester or the entire academic year 
the period of july through september was the first full peak origination season for monogram based loan offerings and marked our return  after a three year absence  to meaningful origination volumes 
the following table represents our loan origination metrics with respect to our monogram based programs for fiscal and fiscal fiscal partnered lending union federal total partnered lending union federal total dollars in thousands applications credit approved applications booked loans disbursed loans 
table of contents portfolio performance credit performance of consumer related loans generally has been adversely affected by general economic conditions in the united states over the past three years 
these conditions have included higher unemployment rates and deteriorating credit performance  including higher levels of education loan defaults and lower recoveries on such defaults 
these conditions have had  and may continue to have  a material adverse effect on our loan portfolio performance 
however  our monogram based education loan portfolios have yet to experience significant adverse portfolio performance as a majority of this portfolio has yet to experience more than months of seasoning 
consequently  in evaluating loan portfolio performance  we review projected gross default rates  post default recovery rates  the availability of third party credit enhancement and the creditworthiness of various guarantors that provide any such credit enhancement 
further  we evaluate the loan portfolio performance of the securitization trusts that we previously facilitated and  accordingly  the estimated fair value of our service revenue receivables from those trusts 
the service revenue receivables that remain on our consolidated balance sheet at june  are not significantly impacted by defaults or recoveries since the trusts possess guarantees that help partially negate the overall impact of any default activity 
these securitization trusts are also cash flowing  seasoned portfolios that  for the most part  have relatively short weighted average lives 
capital markets we believe that conditions in the capital markets generally improved in fiscal compared to recent years 
in particular  investors in abs demonstrated increased interest in abs backed by private education loans that exhibited a strong credit profile 
additionally  in fiscal investors demonstrated increasing interest in longer duration abs in the sector 
however  global capital markets experienced volatility during fiscal  particularly in light of the credit turmoil in europe 
we believe that  as a result of the recent market trends  there has been a tightening in credit spreads for the private education loan securitization marketplace during fiscal and that there may be opportunities to finance private education loans in the abs market 
the structure and economics of any financing transaction may be materially different from prior transactions that we have sponsored 
such differences may include lower revenues as a result of wider credit spreads and higher initial cash requirements on our part 
uncertainties our near term financial performance and future growth depends in large part on our ability to successfully and efficiently market our monogram platform and tms services and originate education loans through union federal so that we may grow and diversify our client base and revenues 
facilitated loan volume is a key element of our financial results and business strategy  and we believe that the results from the academic year demonstrate market demand for monogram based education loans 
we have invested in our distribution capabilities over the course of the past year  including our school channel sales force and tms  but we face challenges in increasing loan volumes after our prolonged absence from the marketplace 
for example  competitors with larger customer bases  greater name or brand recognition  or more established customer relationships than those of our clients  have an advantage in attracting loan applicants at a lower acquisition cost than us and making education loans on a recurring  or serialized  basis 
these disadvantages for us are particularly acute in the current peak season because we have only been operating monogram based loan programs since fiscal outlook our long term success depends on our ability to attract additional lender clients  or otherwise obtain additional sources of interim or permanent financing 
this is particularly true because of the regulatory conditions and approvals relating to the union federal private student loan program 
to date  we have entered into education loan program agreements based on our monogram platform with four lender clients 
we are uncertain as to the degree of market acceptance that our monogram platform will achieve  particularly in the current economic environment where lenders continue to evaluate their education lending business models 
we 
table of contents believe  however  that the credit quality of the loan portfolios originated in the academic year will be attractive to additional potential lender clients  as well as capital markets participants 
we also believe that the ability to permanently finance private education loan portfolios through the capital markets would make our products and services more attractive to lenders and would accelerate improvement in our long term financial results 
we are uncertain of the volume of education loans to be generated by the monogram based loan programs of our four lender clients  one of which is our subsidiary union federal  or any additional lender clients  during the upcoming peak season for the academic year 
it is our view that returning to profitability will be dependent on a number of factors  including our loan capacity and related volumes  expense management and growth at tms and union federal  and the availability of financing alternatives  including our ability to successfully re enter the securitization market 
in particular  we need to generate loan volumes substantially greater than those that we have generated to date  as well as to develop funding capacity for monogram based loan programs at loan volume levels greater than those of our four lender clients with lower credit enhancement levels and higher capital market advance rates than those available today 
we must also continue to achieve efficiencies in attracting applicants  through loan serialization or otherwise  in order to reduce our overall cost of acquisition 
changes in any of the following factors could materially affect our financial results demand for education financing  which may be affected by changes in limitations established by the federal government on the amount of federal loans that a student can receive  the terms and eligibility criteria for loans and grants under federal or state government programs and legislation recently passed or currently under consideration  the extent to which our services and products  including our monogram platform and tms offerings  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the amount of education loan volume disbursed under our lender clients monogram based loan programs  an adverse outcome relating to the federal income tax treatment of our sale of the trust certificate in fiscal or our asset services agreement with the purchaser of the trust certificate  including any challenge related to federal tax refunds previously received in the amount of million as a result of the audit currently being conducted by the irs  regulatory requirements applicable to union federal  tms and us  including conditions and approvals relating to the union federal private student loan program  which limit union federal s ability to fund education loans  conditions in the education loan financing market  including the costs or availability of financing  rating agency assumptions or actions  and market receptivity to private education loan asset backed securitizations  the underlying loan performance of the monogram based loan program  including the net default rates  unemployment rates  and the timing and amounts of excess credit enhancements that may be material to us  the resolution of any appeal of the atb order in the cases pertaining to our massachusetts state income tax returns  application of critical accounting policies and estimates  which impact the carrying value of assets and liabilities  as well as our determinations to consolidate or deconsolidate a vie  application of the dodd frank act  enacted in july  through the supervisory authority of the cfpb  which has the authority to regulate consumer financial products such as education loans  and to take enforcement actions against institutions marketing and selling consumer financial products under its supervision  such as union federal  and institutions that act as service providers to originators of education loans  such as our subsidiary fmer  
table of contents applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which lenders agree to make education loans  the terms of future portfolio funding transactions  including disclosure and risk retention requirements  recovery rates on defaulted education loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  and departures or long term unavailability of key personnel 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   june  and june  the financial results of operations include fmd and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years then ended 
these results are reported through our continuing operations 
previously consolidated ncslt trusts and gate trusts and the results of our subsidiary fmds are included in discontinued operations as discussed below for each of the fiscal years then ended 
discontinued operations consistent with our goal of refining our business model and focusing on our monogram platform and tuition billing and payment services  we disposed of certain components of our business in fiscal in particular  we sold our variable interests in the trusts  we sold our subsidiary fmds  and we resigned as the special servicer of the trusts  including the ncslt trusts 
in addition  the new third party owner of fmds terminated the agreement  to be effective september   with our subsidiary fmer for the special servicing of the nct trusts  including the gate trusts 
upon our adoption of asu and asu  effective july   we consolidated ncslt trusts and three gate trusts  which comprised our securitization trust segment 
on november   we sold to a third party all of our interests in the structuring advisory agreements relating to the trusts and the related asset services agreement for million in cash 
our variable interests in the trusts included our right to receive the additional structural advisory fees and the asset servicing fees under those respective agreements 
as a result of this sale  we no longer held a variable interest in the ncslt trusts and were  therefore  no longer the primary beneficiary of the ncslt trusts 
we deconsolidated billion of assets and billion of liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet and recognized a billion million non cash gain in our statement of operations during the second quarter of fiscal  representing the accumulated deficit in ncslt trusts 
on march   fmd sold to a third party all of its outstanding capital stock in fmds for million in cash 
fmds served as the trust administrator of the nct trusts 
on march   the new third party owner of fmds terminated the agreement  to be effective september   with our subsidiary fmer for the special servicing of the nct trusts 
with the termination of this agreement  we no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the gate trusts and  therefore  we were no longer the primary beneficiary of these trusts 
as such  we deconsolidated the gate trusts effective march  we deconsolidated million of assets and million of liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet and recognized a million non cash gain in our statement of operations during the third quarter of fiscal  representing the accumulated deficit in the gate trusts 
in addition to the non cash gain of million  we also recorded an additional gain of million representing the fair value of the residual interests related to these trusts that were previously eliminated through consolidation  resulting in a total non cash gain of million for the deconsolidation event 
on april   fmer provided its notice of resignation as special servicer of the trusts 
the resignation became effective june  pursuant to the terms of the resignation  fmer will assist the new special servicer of the trusts for a transition period that will terminate as of november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we no longer had any significant continuing involvement in the operations relating to the ncslt trusts and the gate trusts once fmer ceased to provide special servicing to these trusts 
further  we concluded that this would occur within an appropriate assessment period for both the ncslt trust and the gate trusts 
as such  we reported the operations and activities relating to the ncslt trusts  the gate trusts and fmds within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the non cash gains representing the accumulated deficit recognized upon deconsolidations of the 
table of contents ncslt trusts and the gate trusts  as discussed above and previously reported in our securitization trusts segment  are now included in discontinued operations 
further  the gain recognized as the result of the sale of fmds  as well as the revenues and expenses of fmds  were recorded in discontinued operations 
assets and liabilities related to these operations have been reclassified to assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations  respectively 
changes to income tax allocations our net loss from continuing operations and discontinued operations  net of tax  reported in this annual report are different from what we reported in our earnings release issued august  due to changes in the allocation of income taxes between continuing operations and discontinued operations 
net income and total earnings per share remain unchanged 
the impact on earnings per fully diluted share was a reduction in the loss from continuing operations from per fully diluted share to per fully diluted share for the fiscal year ended june  income from discontinued operations  on a fully diluted share basis  was reduced from per fully diluted share to per fully diluted share for the fiscal year ended june  total earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  remained the same at for the fiscal year ended june  the net loss per share for the three month period ended june  of remained unchanged

table of contents we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared with a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal the decrease in the net loss year over year of million was principally the result of a million improvement in the fair value changes of service revenue receivables and a larger income tax benefit of million 
we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared with a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal the decrease in the net loss year over year of million was principally the result of a million loss on education loans incurred in fiscal partially offset by a million lower income tax benefit in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million largely related to tax benefits that became available to fmd as a result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of  or whbaa  offset by accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits 
we reported net income from discontinued operations  net of taxes of billion  or per share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal  compared to a net loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal the increase year over year was principally the result of billion in gains recorded from the deconsolidations of the securitization trusts 
net interest income after provision for loan losses for fiscal  net interest income after provision for loan losses increased by million to million from thousand in fiscal the increase resulted from an improved net interest margin due to an increase in net interest income from higher yielding investment securities and education loans held by union federal 
the provision for loan losses decreased by thousand  reflecting higher cash recoveries received during fiscal on previously defaulted education loans transferred by union federal to fmd in net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased to thousand in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease of million in net interest income  largely as a result of the sale of the education loans previously held for sale and lower interest rates on loans  cash and cash equivalents 
non interest revenues non interest revenues include tuition payment processing fees earned by tms  fee for service revenues for loan origination and program support and fees related to our monogram platform  as well as fees for portfolio management performed on behalf of the securitization trusts that we facilitated 
it also includes the fair value changes to service revenue receivables 
non interest revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and june  were million and thousand  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was principally due to the result of a non cash loss of million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal for changes to the recovery rate assumption used in determining the fair value of the service revenue receivables and due to tms tuition payment processing fees 
since we did not acquire tms until december   our fiscal results only included six months of results of tms subsequent to our acquisition of tms versus a full year of revenue recorded in fiscal tuition payment processing fees tuition payment processing fee revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and june  were million and million  respectively 
the increase for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to results for the fiscal year ended june  only including the results of tms for the six months subsequent to our acquisition of tms on december  fair value changes to service revenue receivables we record our service revenue receivables at fair value in our balance sheet 
at june   our service revenue receivables consisted of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables and represent the estimated fair value of the service revenue receivable expected to 
table of contents be collected over the life of the various separate securitization trusts that have purchased education loans facilitated by us  with no further service obligations on our part 
prior to the sale of our variable interests in the trusts on november   we recorded asset servicing fee and additional structural advisory fee receivables in the ncslt trusts 
as compensation for our services related to asset servicing  we were entitled to a monthly asset servicing fee based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the education loans owned by the trusts 
changes in the estimated fair value of the service revenue receivables due  less any cash distributions received  are recorded in our statement of operations within the fair value changes to service revenue receivables 
in the absence of market based transactions  we use cash flow modeling techniques to derive an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes 
see note  fair value measurements  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of the significant observable and unobservable inputs used to develop our fair value estimates 
such estimates include  but are not limited to  recovery  default and prepayment rates  discount rates  and the forward libor curve 
the following table summarizes the details of the fair value changes to additional structural advisory fees  residual receivables and asset servicing fees fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands additional structural advisory fees residuals asset servicing fees total fair value changes to service revenue receivables the increase in the fair value changes to service revenue receivables of million from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to the losses recorded in fiscal related to decreases in our net recovery rate assumptions for the ncslt trusts as compared to fiscal during fiscal  the additional structural advisory fee receivables related to the ncslt trusts were sold in november for million in cash 
losses in fiscal were related to increases in our discount rate and default assumptions partially offset by a lower prepayment rate assumptions largely relating to the ncslt trusts 
other administrative fees other administrative fees for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively  with decreases of thousand and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as compared to their prior year periods 
the decreases were principally due to lower allowable revenues as a result of reductions in expense reimbursements by the trusts under special servicing agreements for default prevention as well as lower education loan balances upon which the administrative fees are based 
revenues under special servicing agreements were based  in part  on the actual expenses incurred by our subsidiary fmer in its capacity as special servicer  and  in part  on the dollar volume of education loans outstanding in various trusts 
fmer s reimbursement for expenses as special servicer was capped at monthly aggregate amounts

compensation and benefits expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of lower stock based compensation expense and incentive compensation recorded in fiscal partially offset by an increase in headcount due to our acquisition of tms as of december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase of million was a result of higher marketing expenses incurred in fiscal related to loan acquisition and the initial brand development of union federal s monogram based loan programs  partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses for certain fixed assets that were fully depreciated and lower third party servicer costs related to special servicing 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal to million  reflecting continued cost cutting and efficiency efforts 
occupancy expense  which reflected a charge related to unoccupied space in the amount of million taken in fiscal  declined million 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased due to the retirement of certain fixed assets 
increases in third party servicers and other expenses primarily related to our acquisition of tms in fiscal losses on education loans held for sale we did not have any education loans held for sale during fiscal and fiscal we recorded losses on education loans held for sale of million in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  union federal sold education loans held for sale to an unaffiliated third party for million 
we recorded an unrealized loss of million during the first quarter of fiscal on all education loans held for sale based on the price we received from a third party for the loans 
in addition to the sale  we recorded additional net unrealized losses of million during fiscal our estimates of fair value of the education loans held for sale at june  were based on our cash flow model  which reflected increases in assumptions for default rates and lower recovery rates 

table of contents other income we recorded other income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to resolution of certain matters related to the teri reorganization 
this income represented the forgiveness of notes payable and other liabilities  and cash distributions from the liquidating trust under teri s confirmed plan of reorganization 
during fiscal  we also recorded income related to the deconsolidations of the securitization trusts previously consolidated of million largely relating to the fair value of the residual interests that were previously eliminated upon the adoption of asu on july  fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands cash received in excess of recorded receivables reversal of recorded liabilities gain from deconsolidations of trusts total other income income taxes we are subject to federal income tax  as well as income tax in multiple us state and local jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate is calculated on a consolidated basis 
the irs has begun an audit of our tax returns for fiscal years through in addition  we are involved in several matters before the atb relating to the massachusetts tax treatment of gate  a former subsidiary of fmd 
see item  legal proceedings  and note  commitments and contingencies income tax matters  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information regarding these matters 
our state income tax returns in jurisdictions other than massachusetts remain subject to examination for various fiscal years ended between june  and june  income tax benefit from continuing operations was million in fiscal compared to an income tax expense of thousand in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the benefit in fiscal was principally the result of the adjustment to our income tax liability based on the atb order 
due to enactment of the whbaa  described below  we recorded an income tax benefit for certain losses in fiscal  as the legislation permitted the carryback of these losses to offset taxable income in earlier periods 
beginning in fiscal  we no longer had any carryback to offset taxable income in prior periods 
as a result  we recorded a net operating loss carryforward asset as of june   totaling million for which we recorded a full valuation allowance 
in november  the whbaa was signed into law 
under the whbaa  we were permitted to carryback the taxable losses from either fiscal or for five years instead of two years 
we filed our fiscal tax return and elected to carry that taxable loss back for five years 
as a result of the whbaa and pre existing net operating loss carryback rules  we received an income tax refund of million in october under current law  we do not have remaining taxes paid within available net operating loss carryback periods  and it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized through future reversals of existing temporary differences or available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary for all of our deferred tax assets not scheduled to reverse against existing deferred tax liabilities as of june  and june  we will continue to review the recognition of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
financial condition cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we had combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million at june  and june   respectively

the decrease of million resulted primarily from cash used to purchase higher yielding assets  net of deposit growth  of million as we diversified our balance sheet to improve our overall financial performance  and million used to fund operations  which were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sales of certain service revenue receivables and fmds 
restricted cash at june   restricted cash in our balance sheet included cash held by tms of million  including million held at union federal  and restricted cash held by fmd and its other non bank subsidiaries 
restricted cash held by tms represents tuition payments collected from students or their families on behalf of educational institutions 
these cash balances are held in escrow under a trust agreement for the benefit of tms educational institution clients and are generally subject to cyclicality  tending to peak in august of each school year  early in the enrollment cycle  and to decrease in may  at the end of the school year 
during fiscal  tms restricted cash balances have ranged from a high of million during august to a low of million during may in december  we transferred million of tms deposits from a third party institution to union federal 
the deposit remains subject to a trust agreement between tms and a third party trustee 
subject to the capital requirements and other laws  regulations  and restrictions applicable to union federal  the cash that is deposited with union federal in connection with the tuition payment plans is not restricted and  accordingly  is not included in restricted cash and investments in our consolidated financial statements 
restricted cash held by our other subsidiaries relates to recoveries on defaulted education loans collected on behalf of clients as well as undistributed loan origination proceeds 
we record a liability in our balance sheet representing tuition payments due to our tms clients  recoveries on defaults due to securitization trusts and education loan proceeds due to schools 
investments available for sale investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value at our balance sheet date 
investments available for sale principally consisted of mortgage backed federal agency securities held by union federal at both june  and june  the investments available for sale increased by million from june  to million as of june  as a result of union federal s purchase of mortgage backed securities during fiscal the portfolio generated gross unrealized gains of thousand and thousand at june  and june   respectively  which was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity deficit 
loans at june  and june   we classified all education loans and substantially all mortgage loans as held to maturity 
the net carrying value of loans consisted of the following  as of the dates indicated june  dollars in thousands education loans held to maturity mortgage loans held to maturity education loans held to maturity we began originating monogram based loans through union federal in fiscal almost all education loans held to maturity at june  were held by the securitizations trusts that we consolidated as of july  and which were deconsolidated on november  and march  these education loans are part of our discontinued assets of billion at june

we may also apply qualitative adjustments in determining the allowance for loan losses 
our default experience with this loan portfolio is limited by the seasoning of the portfolio  however  we have utilized our historical database and experience in projecting the level of defaults and recoveries of the monogram based loan portfolio relying in part on historical results from our securitization trusts that we previously facilitated for loans that have similar credit characteristics to those in our monogram based loan portfolio 
at june   there was thousand of educations loans that were on non accrual status and no education loans that had specific reserves 
these loans were transferred by union federal to fmd in  prior to the launch of our monogram platform 
our policy is to have a specific allowance for loans greater than days past due  but not yet charged off 
due to the nature and extent of the monogram based education loans issued through union federal  none of these loans were greater than days past due at june  loans which were transferred by union federal to fmd in  prior to our monogram platform were fully reserved for at june  and overall education loan credit quality management monitors the credit quality of an education loan based on loan status  as outlined below 
the impact of changes in loan status  such as delinquency and time in repayment  is incorporated into the allowance for loan loss calculation quarterly through our projection of defaults 

table of contents during fiscal  union federal disbursed monogram based loans in the aggregate principal amount of million 
these loans had a weighted average fico score of at origination  and had co signers 
at june   of our monogram based loans were delinquent and there were no defaults 
the following table provides additional information on the status of education loans outstanding june  as a percentage of total dollars in thousands principal of loans outstanding in basic forbearance in school and in deferment in repayment  classified as current days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due in default days past due  but not yet charged off total gross loan principal outstanding non accrual loan principal days past due past due loan principal days  but days past due still accruing interest we use the following terms to describe borrowers payment status in school and in deferment under the terms of a majority of the education loans  a borrower is eligible to defer principal and interest payments while carrying a specified academic course load and may be eligible to defer payments for an additional six months after graduation during a grace period 
at the end of the deferment period  any accrued but unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding 
at june   approximately of education loans were in school and in deferment 
forbearance under the terms of the education loans  a borrower may apply for forbearance  which is a temporary reprieve from making full contractual payments 
forbearance can take many forms  at the option of the creditor 
the most common forms of forbearance include the following basic forbearance cessation of all contractual payments for a maximum allowable forbearance period of one year  granted in three month increments 
alternative payment plans under an alternative payment plan  a borrower can make a reduced payment for a limited period of time 
the amount of the payment varies depending on the program and may be set at a fixed dollar amount  a percentage of contractual required payments or interest only payments 
generally  approval for alternative payment plans is granted for a maximum of six to months  depending on the program 
these plans are available as part of our monogram based programs 
the use of forbearance is contemplated at the origination of an education loan and is included in the credit agreement with the borrower 
under both basic forbearance and alternative payment plans  the education loan continues to accrue interest 
when forbearance ceases  unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding  and the borrower s required payments are recalculated at a higher amount to pay off the loan  plus the additional accrued and capitalized interest  at the original stated interest rate by the original maturity date 
there is no forgiveness of principal or interest  reduction in the interest rate or extension of the maturity date 
forbearance programs result in a delay in the timing of payments received from borrowers  but at the same time  assuming the collection of the forborne amounts  provide for an increase in the gross volume of cash receipts over the term of the education loan due to the additional accrued interest capitalized while in forbearance 
forbearance programs may have the effect of delaying default emergence  and alternative payment plans may reduce the utilization of basic forbearance 

table of contents in repayment we determine the repayment status of a borrower  including a borrower making payments pursuant to alternative payment plans  by contractual due dates 
a borrower making reduced payments for a limited period of time pursuant to an alternative payment plan will be considered current if such reduced payments are timely made 
under our monogram platform  borrowers may be in repayment while in school 
payment options while in school include full principal and interest  partial interest and interest only 
mortgage loans held to maturity through our bank subsidiary  union federal  we carry a held to maturity portfolio of mortgage loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses for our mortgage loan portfolio held to maturity on a specific identification basis when the loan becomes days past due or the borrower makes modified payments 
we set the allowance for loan losses at an amount believed to be adequate so that the net carrying value of the mortgage loan does not exceed the net realizable value of the collateral 
in addition  we establish a general allowance for loan losses for mortgage loans less than days past due based upon certain characteristics attributable to the collateral 
a mortgage loan for which we have foreclosed on the property is reclassified to other real estate owned  a component of other assets  and is carried at estimated net realizable value 
we do not have any mortgage loan greater than days past due that is accruing interest 
goodwill intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
in connection with our acquisition of tms  we recorded other intangible assets related to the tms customer list and tradename  each of which we amortize on a straight line basis over years  and technology  which we amortize on a straight line basis over six years 
we record amortization expense in general and administrative expenses in our statement of operations 
the customer list intangible asset is related to educational institutions with which tms had existing tuition programs in place as of december  the trade name intangible asset relates to the name and reputation of tms in the tuition payment industry 
intangible assets attributable to technology represented the replacement cost of software and systems acquired that are necessary to support operations  net of an obsolescence factor 
goodwill represents the value ascribed to the acquisition of tms that cannot be separately ascribed to a tangible or intangible asset 
we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on may   which is our impairment testing date  and concluded that the fair market value of the tms reporting unit was greater than in excess of our recorded book value and  therefore  was not impaired as of that date 
in determining whether impairment exists  we assess impairment at the level of the tms reporting unit 
there have been no indicators of impairment since that date 
various assumptions go into our assessment of whether there is any goodwill impairment to be recorded 
the more meaningful assumptions that contribute to the cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the tms reporting unit include the net retention rate of new and existing clients  the penetration rate achieved in the overall customer portfolio  adoption of refund management and campus advantage products and pricing  the level of interest income to be earned by tms on funds received but not yet disbursed to client schools  including the forward libor curve  the level of cash balances and the applicable hold periods  all of which impact net interest income  expense levels at tms and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
tms business would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur higher attrition rates than planned as a result of the competitive environment or our inability to provide products and services that are competitive in the marketplace  lower than planned adoption rates of refund management and campus advantage products  higher expense levels incurred to provide services to tms clients  a lower interest rate environment  shorter hold periods or lower cash balances than contemplated  which would reduce our overall net interest income opportunity for cash that is held by us on behalf of our school clients  increases in equity returns required by investors and changes in our business model that may impact one or more of these variables 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded amortization expenses on our intangible assets of million  which effectively reduced our balance of intangible assets from million at june  to million at june  contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations consist of commitments under operating leases

we expect to collect million in sublease revenue over the term of this sublease 
in addition  effective july   we entered into an amendment to reduce our rented space in our medford  massachusetts location by approximately  square feet  which results in a savings of million over the term of the lease 
the contractual obligations table does not reflect any sublease revenues from the subleases of our boston locations or savings from the reduction in our rented space in medford  massachusetts 
total stockholders equity deficit effective july   upon our adoption of asu and asu  we recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this amount represented the net deficit attributable to the consolidated securitization trusts  as well as the reversal of residual interests recognized in prior periods for entities consolidated  partially offset by deconsolidation of the net deficit of ufsb spv and the reversal of certain related deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
total stockholders equity at june  no longer included this deficit as a result of the deconsolidation of these securitization trusts during fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we offer outsourcing services in connection with education loan programs  from program design through securitization of the education loans 
we have historically structured and facilitated the securitization of education loans for our clients through a series of special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of the securitization trusts we facilitated have been to generate sources of liquidity for our clients and union federal s assets sold into such trusts and make available more funds to students and colleges 
see critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation below for a discussion of our determination to not consolidate these securitization trusts

we also use a non gaap financial metric  net operating cash usage when evaluating our cash and liquidity position  discussed in detail under non gaap measure net operating cash usage below 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal was million  compared with net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of million for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we received million in tax refunds as a result of our ability to carryback taxable losses from either fiscal or fiscal for five years instead of two years due to the enactment of the whbaa 
this cash inflow was partially offset by our funding of million to participation accounts during fiscal as we began processing education loans based on our monogram platform 
cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal reflected the receipt of tax refunds of million and million of proceeds from the sale of union federal s education loans held for sale 
we anticipate continuing to receive fees related to loan origination and portfolio management services and fees related to monogram based loan programs 
starting january   we also began to receive fees related to the operations of tms 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  coupled with management of our expenses and these fees  will be adequate to fund our operating losses in the short term as we seek to expand our client and revenue base over the short and long term 
we are uncertain  however  as to whether we will be successful in selling our monogram platform to additional lenders or how much loan volume may be originated by current or any additional lenders in the future 
net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was principally the result of million in investment purchases and million in education loans partially offset by the absence of the effect of million in net cash used in fiscal for our purchase of tms 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to a net million of cash invested in short term investments 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was million for fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to a million change in the volume of deposit activity at union federal 
cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal reflected decreases in the volume of deposits and payments under capital leases and borrowings under the education loan warehouse facility 
the occ regulates all capital distributions by union federal directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
union federal is required to file a notice with the occ at least days before the proposed declaration of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by union federal s board of directors 
union federal must file an application to receive the approval of the occ for a proposed capital distribution when  among other circumstances  the total amount of all capital distributions including the proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
a notice or application to make a capital distribution by union federal may be disapproved or denied by the occ if it determines that  after making the capital distribution  union federal would fail to meet minimum required capital levels or if the capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns or is otherwise restricted by statute  regulation or agreement between union federal and the occ or a condition imposed by an occ agreement 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia  an fdic insured depository institution such as union federal is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdicia 
sources and uses of liquidity we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents and revenues from operations  and we expect to fund our long term liquidity requirements through revenues from operations and various financing vehicles available to us in the abs markets and may utilize issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including cash necessary to fund our operations  including the operations of union federal and tms  and capital expenditures  the extent to which our services and products  including monogram based loan programs and tms offerings  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the results of the audit conducted by the irs of our tax returns for fiscal through fiscal  which could result in challenges to tax refunds previously received in the amount of million in connection with our sale of the trust certificate  the profitability of our monogram platform  which is dependent on  among other things  the amount of loan volume our lender clients are able to generate and costs incurred to acquire such volume  the extent to which we fund credit enhancement arrangements or contribute to credit facility providers in connection with our monogram platform  the ability to access wholesale lending opportunities within union federal to help meet the liquidity needs generated by monogram based loans

in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  we have taken certain broad measures to reduce the risk related to education loans and residual receivables on our balance sheet  to change our fee structure and to add new products and reduce our overhead expenses 
see executive summary overview  above for an expanded description of actions taken by us since fiscal in response to the economic challenges facing us 
in addition  the fmd board of directors has eliminated regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
deposits union federal has liabilities for retail time  money market and savings deposits accounts 
the following table summarizes union federal s time deposits greater than thousand by maturity at june  dollars in thousands within three months  three to six months  six months to twelve months  greater than twelve months  total time deposits thousand  the maturities of these deposits are not directly indicative of the future timing of cash needed for financing activities because they do not take into account the customers that may reinvest their funds into new time deposits or into other types of deposit accounts 
restricted funds due to clients as part of our tms operations  we collect tuition payments from students or their families on behalf of educational institutions 
included in restricted cash on our balance sheet are recoveries on defaulted education loans due to our portfolio management clients primarily securitization trusts facilitated by us  undisbursed education loan proceeds for our loan origination clients and tuition payments in custody at other financial institutions 
these cash balances are recorded as restricted cash on our balance sheet because they are deposited in segregated depository accounts 
we record a liability in our balance sheet representing tuition payments due to our tms clients  recoveries on defaults due to securitization trusts and education loan proceeds due to students or schools 
lines of credit at june   through union federal we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  or june  support of subsidiary bank union federal is a federally chartered thrift that is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in 
table of contents initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our liquidity 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  union federal must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of union federal s assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications  however  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
union federal s equity capital was million at june   up from million at june   due to million in capital contributions paid to union federal by fmd during the fiscal year ended june  quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require union federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets each as defined in the regulations 
as of june  and june   union federal was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in march  the fmd board of directors adopted resolutions required by the ots undertaking to support the implementation by union federal of its business plan  so long as union federal is owned or controlled by fmd  and to notify the ots in advance of any distributions to our stockholders in excess of million per fiscal quarter and any incurrence or guarantee of debt in excess of million 
these resolutions continue to be required by the federal reserve 
effective july   fmd is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve  as a savings and loan holding company  and union federal is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ 
union federal s regulatory capital ratios were as follows as of the dates below regulatory guidelines june  minimum well capitalized capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier core capital non gaap measure net operating cash usage in addition to providing financial measurements based on gaap  we present below an additional financial metric that we refer to as net operating cash usage and that was not prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define net operating cash usage to approximate cash requirements to fund our operations 
net operating cash usage is not directly comparable to our consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap 
legislative and regulatory guidance discourage the use of  and emphasis on  non gaap financial metrics and require companies to explain why a non gaap financial metric is relevant to management and investors 
management and the fmd board of directors use this non gaap financial metric  in addition to gaap financial measures  as a basis for measuring and forecasting our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods 
this non gaap financial measure is also used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap financial metric helps investors to gain a better understanding of our annual results  including our non interest expenses and year end liquidity position  particularly in light of dislocations in the private education loan industry and the capital markets that have affected us 
in addition  our presentation of this non gaap financial measure is consistent with how we expect that analysts may calculate their estimates of our financial results in their research reports and with how clients  investors  analysts and financial news media may evaluate our financial results 
there are limitations associated with reliance on any non gaap financial measure we use because any such measure is specific to our operations and financial performance  which makes comparisons with other 
table of contents companies financial results more challenging 
nevertheless  by providing both gaap and non gaap financial measures  we believe that investors are able to compare our gaap results to those of other companies  while also gaining a better understanding of our operating performance  consistent with management s evaluation 
net operating cash usage should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
net operating cash usage excludes the effects of income taxes  acquisitions or divestitures  participation account net fundings and changes in other assets and other liabilities that are solely related to short term timing of cash payments or receipts 
in accordance with the requirements of regulation g promulgated by the sec  the table below presents the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  loss from continuing operations  before income taxes  for the twelve months ended june  and june   respectively  and reconciles the gaap measure to the comparable non gaap financial metric twelve months ended june  dollars in thousands loss from continuing operations  before income taxes non cash adjustments to net loss from continuing operations  before income taxes non cash gain from trust deconsolidations fair value changes to service revenue receivables depreciation and amortization stock based compensation tms deferred revenue cash receipts from education loans  net of interest income accruals cash receipts from trust distributions non cash gain from teri settlement other  net of cash flows from fmds non gaap net operating cash usage net operating cash usage for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased thousand compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal net operating cash usage for fiscal increased by million as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was as a result of million in increased marketing expenses related to loan acquisition and the initial brand development of union federal s monogram based loan programs incurred during fiscal year  partially offset by a million decrease in special servicing expenses 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenues or operating expenses during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on our historical experience  economic conditions and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
on an 
table of contents ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of the fmd board of directors 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies whether or not to consolidate the financial results of a vie  the determination of goodwill and intangible asset impairment  and income taxes relating to uncertain tax positions accrued for under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes now incorporated into asc  income taxes 
consolidation we review certain vies for which we have previously securitized to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
we continually reassess our involvement with each vie in which we have an interest  both on and off balance sheet  and our determination of whether consolidation or deconsolidation of a vie is appropriate 
we monitor matters related to our ability to control economic performance  such as contractual changes in the services we provide  the extent of our ownership and the rights of third parties to terminate us as a service provider 
in addition  we monitor the financial performance of each vie for indications that we may or may not have the right to absorb benefits or the obligation to absorb losses associated with variability in the financial performance of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
if  for any reason  we determine that we can no longer be considered the primary beneficiary  we would be required to deconsolidate the vie 
deconsolidation of a vie is accounted for in the same manner as the sale of a subsidiary  with a gain or loss recorded in our statement of operations to the extent that proceeds  if any  are more or less than the net assets of the vie 
our determination to consolidate or deconsolidate vies may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and make comparisons between time periods challenging 
effective july   the fasb amended asc and removed the exemption from consolidation for a qualifying special purpose entity 
asc further requires enterprises to perform analyses to determine if they are the primary beneficiary of a vie 
a primary beneficiary of a vie is an enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that vie s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
as a result  on july   we consolidated securitization trusts that were facilitated by us because we determined that our services related to default prevention and collections management  for which we can only be removed for cause  combined with the variability that we absorbed as part of our securitization fee structure  made us the primary beneficiary of those trusts 
in addition  we deconsolidated our indirect subsidiary  ufsb spv  because we determined that we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact ufsb spv s economic performance 
during fiscal  we deconsolidated these securitization trusts and have included the results of those trusts through the period of deconsolidation in discontinued operations 
we also monitor our involvement with other off balance sheet vies for which we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary due to the sole  unilateral rights of other parties to terminate us in our role as service provider or due to a lack of obligation on our part to absorb benefits or losses of the vie that would be 
table of contents significant to that vie 
significant changes to the pertinent rights of other parties or significant changes to the ranges of possible financial performance outcomes used in our assessment of the variability of cash flows due to us could cause us to change our determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated in future periods 
our determination to consolidate or deconsolidate a vie may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and make comparisons of results between time periods challenging 
review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on december   we completed our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms  formerly a division of keybank national association 
as a result of this acquisition  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
intangible assets acquired consist of tms customer lists  technology and tradename 
the values of these intangible assets were estimated using valuation techniques  based on discounted cash flow analysis 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the period the assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows 
these intangible assets are subject to impairment tests in accordance with gaap  generally  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the operations of the tms reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the tms reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
there are significant judgments involved in determining the fair value of the tms reporting unit  including assumptions regarding the estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities  customer relationships  the value of existing customer contracts  the value of other intangible assets  as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party is willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of tms 
the calculation also requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and an appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at a final fair value 
since the business is not publically traded  and often there is not comparable market data available  there is a higher degree of judgment applied and the use of cash flows is weighted more heavily than the use of market multiples 
in the event that we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on our financial position 
for fiscal and fiscal  we recorded no goodwill impairment 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment at our annual impairment testing date of may income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management s judgment  including determining the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on our tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with our operations 
management monitors liquidity and interest rate risk matters 
these matters are discussed with the fmd board of directors and the union federal board of directors  as applicable 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk applies to all of our interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as service revenue receivables 
the interest rate characteristics of our interest bearing assets are driven by the nature  volume and duration of our interest bearing liabilities 
generally  our interest bearing liabilities are either variable rate instruments or are of a short duration 
demand deposits are generally subject to daily re pricing  and time deposits are generally re priced at maturity 
our interest bearing assets are largely made up of our education loans  mortgages and cash in interest bearing accounts 
our education loan portfolio primarily consists of variable rate loans which reprice in accordance with libor 
as such  as market rates increase or decrease  our interest bearing assets are likely to be immediately impacted while our interest bearing liabilities are slower to reprice 
less than of our fixed rate customer deposits at union federal have maturities in excess of months from june  approximately of the deposits have variable interest rates or fixed interest rates with maturities of six months or less from june  as a result of our decision in the third quarter of fiscal to retain ownership of union federal  we have increased the volume of customer deposits  begun lengthening the average maturities of our customer deposits  and converted a portion of union federal s cash and cash equivalents into higher earning  longer maturity assets including monogram based education loans and investment securities 
we expect each of these initiatives to continue in the short term 
the deposits at union federal had a weighted average life of approximately days at june  deposit pricing is subject to weekly examination by a committee of senior managers from union federal and fmd s finance and risk and compliance departments 
the committee considers competitors pricing  inflows and outflows of deposit balances and union federal s funding requirements to make pricing decisions in order to attain the desired volume of deposits in each given duration and product type 
the frequent re pricing of our liabilities drives our investment decisions 
approximately of union federal s mortgage loans and all of its education loans had variable interest rates at june  although these variable interest rate assets generally reprice more frequently and have longer duration than our deposits  interest rate risk with respect to net interest revenues is mitigated by similarities in the interest rate and market risks underlying loan and deposit pricing 
cash is primarily invested in money market funds  federal funds sold  time deposits with original maturities of less than one year and us federal agency mortgage backed securities 
management regularly reviews a wide variety of interest rate shift scenario results to evaluate interest rate risk exposure  including scenarios showing the effect of steepening or flattening changes in the yield curve 
the changes contemplated in these interest rate scenarios would result in immaterial changes to our overall results  largely as a result of a high percentage of assets that possess variable interest rates and the immateriality of net interest income at june  we use current market interest rates and our expectations of future interest rates to estimate fair value of service revenue receivables 
we believe that this approach adequately reflects the interest rate risk inherent in those estimates
