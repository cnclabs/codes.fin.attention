item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview historically  our business focused on the design  manufacture and marketing of proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by cardiac surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery 
we have expanded our business by including the development of an endoscopic microcutter product line intended for use by thoracic  bariatric  colorectal and general surgeons 
we are developing our microcutter product line based on our proprietary staple on a strip technology  which expands our commercial opportunity into additional surgical markets 
our planned microcutter product line consists of the microcutter xchange  a cartridge based microcutter device with a millimeter shaft diameter and a millimeter staple line  the microcutter xchange  a planned cartridge based microcutter device with a millimeter shaft and a millimeter staple line  the microcutter xpress  the true multi fire endolinear stapling device  the microcutter flexchange a planned cartridge based microcutter device with a flexible shaft to facilitate endoscopic procedures requiring cutting and stapling  the microcutter xpress  a planned multi fire endolinear microcutter device with a millimeter staple line  and the microcutter xpress  a planned cutting and stapling device specifically designed for the bariatric and thoracic surgery markets 
we estimate these planned devices expand our commercial opportunity to approximately million additional procedures annually in the united states  involving  we estimate  over million staple cartridge deployments  million of which we believe are deployed in laparoscopic procedures 
in march  we completed the design verification for and applied conformit europ enne  or the ce mark  to the microcutter xchange  a cartridge based microcutter device with a millimeter shaft diameter and a millimeter staple line 
as we have gained more experience with our microcutter products  we believe that the cartridge based design of the microcutter xchange will permit us to commercially launch this product more quickly than our planned initial multi fire product  the microcutter xpress we believe that the microcutter xchange will be differentiated in the market compared to currently marketed staplers due to its significantly reduced size and ability to articulate up to degrees 
we intend to expand our microcutter product line with the development of the microcutter xchange and only then continue to develop the microcutter xpress in light of our limited financial resources  we have limited development of other potential products in our planned microcutter product line until the development and commercialization of the microcutter xchange has been completed 
we initiated first in man use of the microcutter xpress  with the ce mark  in europe in july  and in november  began enrolling patients in a european clinical trial 
we suspended our clinical trial of the microcutter xpress in europe in december  and recommenced enrollment of the clinical trial with our microcutter xchange in july prior to recommencing the clinical trial of the microcutter xchange  we introduced this product to surgeons in europe to validate the adequate function of the microcutter xchange we plan to commence commercialization of the microcutter xchange in europe in the second half of calendar the microcutter xpress is currently undergoing design changes to address product performance issues encountered in the clinical trial that we commenced in november during the clinical trial  the microcutter xpress did not perform satisfactorily in a small number of deployments in tissue thicknesses that could be considered the upper range typically compatible with the size of staple used in the procedures 
we believe that we have identified the causes for the unsatisfactory deployments  which will require modifications to the microcutter xpress we have been advised by the us food and drug administration  or fda  that the fda will require clinical data related to the staple design used in the planned microcutter product line as part of a k submission for clearance of the products in our planned microcutter product line for marketing and sale in the united states 
we resumed the clinical trial in europe in july  and we intend to enroll patients undergoing only certain types of gastrointestinal surgical procedures  which will be limited due to the tissue thickness involved in the procedure 
we plan to complete enrollment in the clinical trial and required patient followup according to the protocol in the first quarter of calendar year if the results of the trial are favorable  we anticipate that we would submit a k to the fda in the second quarter of calendar while we cannot predict when or if the fda will clear our k submission or what such clearance will cover  we anticipate that the earliest that any such clearance could be obtained would be in the second half of calendar our c port distal anastomosis systems  or c port systems  are sold in the united states and europe 
the c port systems are used to perform a distal anastomosis  which is the connection between a bypass graft vessel and the target coronary artery 
as of june   more than  c port systems had been sold in the united states and europe 
we also currently sell our pas port proximal anastomosis system  or pas port system  in the united states  europe and japan 
the pas port system is used to perform a proximal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to the aorta or other source of blood 
as of june   more than  pas port systems had been sold in the united states  europe and japan 
we use independent distributors and manufacturers representatives to augment a small core direct sales team for our c port systems and pas port system in the united states to contain sales costs while continuing to serve our customers and potential customers for our automated anastomosis product line 
we manufacture our c port and pas port systems with parts we manufacture and components supplied by vendors  which we then assemble  test and package 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we have not generated any revenues from sales of any of the microcutter products that we are developing 
for the fiscal year ended june   we generated net revenue of million  including  of license and development revenue  and incurred a net loss of million 
to date  our c port and pas port systems have had limited commercial adoption  and sales have not met the levels that we had anticipated 
revenues from product sales and milestone payments were not sufficient to support the operation of our business as we had planned 
if we fail to obtain broader commercial adoption of our systems or achieve commercial adoption of our microcutter products  we may be required to delay  further reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts with respect to one or more of our products or one or more of our research and development programs 
on february   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
net proceeds from the financing to us were million 
as of june   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of debt principal outstanding 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the cash that we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted through march   excluding the repayment of the million debt principal outstanding 
we would be able to extend this time period to the extent that we decreased our planned expenditures  or accessed additional capital under the common stock purchase agreement  or purchase agreement  we entered into on december   with aspire capital fund  llc  an illinois limited liability company  or aspire capital  or under the at the market issuance sales agreement  or atm agreement  we entered into on august   with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv 
our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated in their audit report on our fiscal financial statements that our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have based our estimate as to the sufficiency of our cash resources on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  including assumptions with respect to the level of revenue from product sales and the cost of product development  and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the sufficiency of our current cash resources and our need for additional capital  and the timing thereof  will depend on many factors  including the extent of our ongoing research and development programs and related costs  including costs related to the development of the microcutter xchange  the microcutter xchange  the microcutter xpress and additional potential products in our anticipated microcutter product line  our ability to enter into additional license  development and or collaboration agreements with respect to our technology  and the terms thereof  market acceptance and adoption of our current products or future products that we may commercialize  our level of revenues  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  costs and timing of obtaining and maintaining fda  and other regulatory clearances or approvals for our products and potential additional products  securing  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights and the costs thereof  and the effects of competing technological and market developments 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility  enter into product development  license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our commercialized products or products in development 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  particularly in light of the prices at which our common stock has been recently trading 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any product development  licensing  distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights  including with respect to commercialized products or products in development that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional financing or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
our need to raise capital may require us to accept terms that may harm our business or be disadvantageous to our current stockholders 
agreement with century on september   we signed a distribution agreement  or the distribution agreement  with century medical  inc  or century with respect to distribution of our planned microcutter products in japan 
under the terms of a secured note purchase agreement  century agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to million  with principal due on september   under the agreement  subject to certain conditions 
under this facility  we received million on september   and the remaining million on december  the note bears annual interest which is payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of march  june  september and december of each year through september   the maturity date when the total million of principal becomes due 
in return for the loan commitment  we granted century distribution rights to our planned microcutter product line in japan  and a right of first negotiation for distribution rights in japan to future products 
century will be responsible for securing regulatory approval from the ministry of health in japan for the microcutter product line 
after approval for marketing in japan  we would sell microcutter units to century  who would then sell the microcutter devices to their customers in japan 
proceeds from the note and granting the distribution rights were allocated to the note based on their aggregate fair value of million at the dates of receipt 
this fair value was determined by discounting cash flows using a discount rate of  which we estimated was a market rate of borrowing that could be obtained by companies with credit risk similar to ours 
the remainder of the proceeds of million was recognized as debt issuance discount and was allocated to the value of the distribution rights granted to century under the distribution agreement and is included in deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue will be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the distribution agreement  beginning upon the first sale by century of microcutter products in japan 
agreements with intuitive surgical on august   we entered into a license agreement  or license agreement  with intuitive surgical operations  inc  or intuitive surgical  pursuant to which we granted to intuitive surgical a worldwide  sublicenseable  exclusive license to use our intellectual property in the robotics field in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures  but excluding vascular anastomosis applications  for an upfront license fee of million 
we are also eligible to receive a contingent payment if sales of any products incorporating our patent rights achieve a specified level of net sales within a specified period after the date of the license agreement  as well as single digit royalties on sales by intuitive surgical  its affiliates or its sublicensees of specified stapler and clip applier products covered by our patent rights as well as on sales of certain other products covered by our patent rights that may be developed in the future  if any 
each party has the right to terminate the license agreement in the event of the other party s uncured material breach or bankruptcy 
following any termination of the license agreement  the licenses granted to intuitive surgical will continue  and  except in the case of termination for our uncured material breach or insolvency  intuitive surgical s payment obligations will continue as well 
under the license agreement  intuitive surgical has rights to improvements in our technology and intellectual property over a specified period of time 
in addition  on the same date  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with intuitive surgical pursuant to which intuitive surgical paid million to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  or the stock issuance 
the net proceeds recorded to stockholders equity based upon the fair value of our common stock on august   were approximately million after offering expenses 
from the premium paid of million and the upfront license fee payment of million   and million have been recorded as license and development revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  and  has been recorded as deferred revenue as of june  there were no underwriters or placement agents involved with the stock issuance  and no underwriting discounts or commissions or similar fees were payable in connection with the stock issuance 
agreement with aspire capital subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement with aspire capital  we have a right to sell to aspire capital pursuant to the purchase agreement up to million of our common stock at a maximum of  shares per day based on the trading price of our common stock 
in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  concurrently with the execution of the purchase agreement  we issued to aspire capital  shares of our common stock as a commitment fee  or the commitment shares 
the extent to which we rely on aspire capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors  including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
the purchase agreement provides that we may not issue and sell more than  shares of our common stock  including the commitment shares 
as of june   a total of  shares of common stock including the  commitment shares had been issued to aspire capital pursuant to the purchase agreement and million of capital had been raised through the sale of  shares of common stock at an average price of per share 
agreement with mlv subject to the terms and conditions of the atm agreement  we may issue and sell up to million of our common stock through mlv as our sales agent 
the extent to which we rely on sales of common stock under the atm agreement as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors  including the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
the atm agreement provides that the offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the atm agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the sale of all common stock subject to the atm agreement  august   and termination of the atm agreement 
as of june   we received net proceeds of  from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock through mlv 
we are subject to limitations on the amount that we may sell under our shelf registration statement  and therefore that we may sell pursuant to the atm agreement critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to make significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then the recognition of revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we record product sales net of estimated product returns and discounts from the list prices for our products 
the amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have not been material to date 
we adopted accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 which addresses the milestone method of revenue recognition on july   as required 
payments that are contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone are recognized in their entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved subject to satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria at that time 
revenue generated from license fees and performing development services are recognized when they are earned and non refundable upon receipt  over the period of performance  or upon incurrence of the related development expenses in accordance with contractual terms  based on the actual costs incurred to date plus overhead costs for certain project activities 
amounts paid but not yet earned on the project are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as performance is rendered or the related development expenses are incurred 
we adopted asu no 
 which addresses the accounting for multiple element arrangements  on july  the guidance was adopted on a prospective basis and is therefore effective for all new or materially modified multiple element arrangements that we enter into subsequent to july   including the arrangement with intuitive surgical that we entered into on august  this guidance removes the requirement for objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in order to separate a deliverable into a separate unit of accounting 
it also changes the allocation method such that the relative selling price method must be used to allocate arrangement consideration to the units of accounting in an arrangement 
the adoption of this guidance has had a material effect upon the revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended june  and  and will have a material effect upon the revenue recognized in future periods related to the arrangement with intuitive surgical 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
inventory write downs are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value is less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand or reductions in selling prices 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of product sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and the risk of lower customer demand levels 
while we believe the current value of inventories represents all known and estimated changes in demand  we have experienced reduced demand for our c port systems and further unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory write downs that could adversely impact our financial results 
stock based compensation 
we account for employee and director share based compensation plans  including stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus  pursuant to accounting standards codification  or asc  compensation stock compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on fair value based measurement of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
we selected the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value based measurements of share based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions including expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected term of options granted is determined using the simplified method 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the expected volatility is based on the our historical stock price 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal year  since we had limited historical data on volatility of our stock  the expected volatility was based on the volatility of similar entities referred to as guideline companies 
in evaluating similarity  we considered factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size  and financial leverage 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of each option is based on a risk free zero coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal year  the volatility is based on our historical stock price 
we estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for options and restricted stock awards using the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period of each grant 
we recorded fair value based stock based compensation expense of million  or per share  million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net revenue 
net revenue decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net product sales decreased  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease of product sales for the fiscal year ended june   was primarily attributable to both lower pas port and c port systems sales in the united states 
for fiscal years and  sales to century  our distributor in japan  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total product sales 
license and development revenue was  and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the license and development revenue in both years related to the license agreement and million of premium from the stock purchase agreement with intuitive surgical that we entered into in august the license and development revenue of  for fiscal year was related to the amortization of million allocated to technology that may be developed over three years that is subject to the arrangement with intuitive surgical 
the license and development revenue of million for fiscal year related to million allocated to the license rights to technology that existed as of august and million related to the amortization of the million allocated to technology that may be developed over the subsequent three years 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
cost of product sales increased by  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in cost of product sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from increased fixed overhead costs per unit sold in the current year due to building an infrastructure in anticipation of the foreseeable future growth offset in part by a reduced lower of cost or market charge and lower units sold 
our cost of product sales was and of our net product sales in fiscal years and  respectively  due to higher fixed overhead costs per unit sold in the current year due to building an infrastructure in anticipation of the foreseeable future growth offset in part by a reduced lower of cost or market charge and lower units sold 
we expect higher costs relative to product sales for the foreseeable future due to the planned commercialization of our microcutter product line 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical groups and the costs of clinical trials 
research and development expenses decreased by  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to lower molds and tooling expenses of million due to the microcutter program development activities as the molds and tooling have been assessed to have alternative future uses and so have been capitalized  in all cases primarily related to the microcutter program development activities  partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of  due primarily to an increase in the number of personnel  increased prototype project materials of million  increased consulting and professional services expenses of  increased facility related and depreciation expenses of  and increased clinical trial expenses of  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase modestly in absolute terms in fiscal year as we continue to develop the microcutter xchange  the microcutter xchange and the microcutter xpress selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for administrative and sales and marketing personnel  intellectual property and marketing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to higher salaries and benefits of  due primarily to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in absolute terms in fiscal year as we increase the number of individuals in sales and marketing 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower overall market interest rates for the fiscal year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  for fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense was due to the interest  including the accretion of debt discount  on our note payable to century  which we issued in september and december we expect interest expense to increase in future periods as the note payable is scheduled to mature on september   and the debt discount is accreted using the effective interest method 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net product sales increased  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase of product sales for the fiscal year ended june   was primarily attributable to both higher quantities of pas port and c port systems sales in the united states 
for fiscal years and  sales to century  our distributor in japan  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total product sales 
license and development revenue was million and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the license and development revenue of million for fiscal year was related to the license agreement and million premium from the stock purchase agreement with intuitive surgical that we entered into in august the license and development revenue of  for the fiscal year was for development activities on the patent foramen ovale  or pfo  project with cook incorporated under the license  development and commercialization agreement that we entered into in june  as amended 
on january   we and cook mutually agreed to suspend work on the pfo project 
our revenue generating development activities related to the cook vascular closure device were completed in fiscal year  and there was no revenue recognized for the fiscal year ended june  or  related to that agreement 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
cost of product sales decreased by  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in cost of product sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from the release of inventory reserves for excess product sold through and a reduced lower of cost or market charge in the fiscal year 
our cost of product sales was and of our net product sales in fiscal years and  respectively  due to the release of inventory reserves for excess product sold through and a reduced lower of cost or market charge in the fiscal year 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical groups and the costs of clinical trials 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to higher molds and tooling expenses of million  in all cases primarily related to the microcutter program development activities  an increase in salaries and benefits of  due primarily to an increase in the number of personnel  increased prototype project materials of  and increased consulting and professional services expenses of  partially offset by lower non cash stock based compensation expenses of  and lower clinical trial expenses of  as a result of completing the pas port trials and european trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for administrative and sales and marketing personnel  intellectual property and marketing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to higher salaries and benefits of  and an increase in consulting and professional services expenses of  partially offset by lower non cash stock based compensation charges of  interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower overall market interest rates for the fiscal year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to  for fiscal year from  in fiscal year interest expense in each year related to our debt then outstanding to century 
this debt was fully repaid on august  income tax benefit 
under the housing and economic recovery act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the acts  signed into law in july and february  respectively  taxpayers can claim a refundable alternative minimum tax or research and development credit if they forego bonus depreciation on certain qualified fixed assets placed in service between april and december we computed and recognized credits based on fixed assets placed into service in our fiscal year ended june  we recorded an income tax benefit of  in fiscal year  for the us federal refundable credits as provided by the acts 
income taxes due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance  and no benefit has been recognized for our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established as of june  and  to reflect these uncertainties 
at june   we had unrecognized tax benefits of  which would not currently affect our effective tax rate if recognized due to our deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance 
as of june   we had net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future taxable income  if any  of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and million available to reduce future taxable income  if any  for state income taxes 
the net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in the fiscal year we also had federal and state research and development credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  at june  the federal credits begin to expire in fiscal year if not utilized 
the california state credit carry forwards have an unlimited carry forward period and the state of arizona credits begin to expire in fiscal year we have completed a study of our tax attributes under section of the internal revenue code of through june   which resulted in significant limitations on our net operating loss and credit carry forwards prior to utilization 
the related reductions are reflected in the carry forward amounts discussed above 
however  the company issued additional shares in the fiscal years and that may have triggered another ownership change 
a section study to determine the impact of these issuances has not been performed 
if a change in ownership was triggered  the net operating loss carry forwards and credit carry forwards included in the deferred tax assets could be limited 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   our accumulated deficit was million and we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we currently invest some of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in money market funds  corporate debt and government loan securities 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock  long term notes payable  public and private sales of common stock  warrants to purchase common stock and license or collaboration agreements 
on february   we entered into an underwriting agreement with wedbush securities  inc relating to the offering  issuance and sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  par value per share 
on february   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
net proceeds from the financing were million 
on september   we entered into a distribution agreement with century  with respect to distribution of our planned microcutter products in japan 
additionally  under the terms of a secured note purchase agreement  century agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to million  with principal due five years after the first draw by us under the agreement  subject to certain conditions 
in return for the loan commitment  we granted century distribution rights to our planned microcutter product line in japan  and a right of first negotiation for distribution rights in japan to future products 
century will be responsible for securing regulatory approval from the ministry of health in japan for the microcutter product line 
after approval for marketing in japan  we would sell microcutter units to century  who would then sell the microcutter devices to their customers in japan 
we have drawn the full million available to us under the distribution agreement 
the note bears annual interest which is payable quarterly in arrears on the last business day of march  june  september and december of each year through september   the maturity date when the total million of principal becomes due 
proceeds from the note and granting the distribution rights were allocated to the note based on its aggregate fair value of million at the dates of receipt 
this fair value was determined by discounting cash flows using a discount rate of  which we estimated approximated a market rate of return on debt financing that could be obtained by companies with credit risk similar to us 
the remainder of the proceeds of million was allocated to the value of the distribution rights granted to century under the distribution agreement and is included in deferred revenue 
the deferred revenue will be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the distribution agreement  beginning upon the first sale by century of the microcutter products in japan 
on august   we entered into the atm agreement with mlv  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein  we may issue and sell up to million of our common stock through mlv as our sales agent over the term of the atm agreement 
the atm agreement provides that the offering of shares of our common stock pursuant to the atm agreement will terminate upon the earlier of the sale of all common stock subject to the atm agreement  august   and termination of the atm agreement

pursuant to the lease amendment  the term of the lease is extended four years  through august   and we were granted an improvement allowance of  to be used in connection with the construction of alterations and refurbishment of improvements in the premises 
in addition  under the lease amendment  we were granted an option to further extend the lease for a period of two years beyond august   or the option term  and the method of determination of the annual rent payable by us during the option term was set forth in the lease amendment 
under the operating lease we were required to maintain a letter of credit with a restricted cash balance at our bank 
a certificate of deposit of  was recorded as restricted cash in the condensed balance sheets as of june   related to this letter of credit 
summary cash flow data is as follows fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
our net use of cash for fiscal year was primarily attributable to our net loss adjusted for non cash stock based compensation charges of  and approximately  of depreciation and amortization expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of  a decreased inventories of  and an increase in deferred revenue of million resulting from granting japanese distribution rights for our microcutter product line to century

our net use of cash for fiscal year was primarily attributable to our net loss adjusted for non cash stock based compensation charges of million and approximately  of depreciation and amortization expenses  partially offset by decreased inventories of  net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal year reflects purchases of property and equipment of million as well as net purchases of short term investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal year reflects purchases of property and equipment as well as net purchases of short term investments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year was due primarily to the net proceeds of million received from our common stock offering in february  the net proceeds from the issuance of a note payable to century of million and aggregate net proceeds of million received from the sale of shares of common stock to aspire capital and through mlv 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year was due primarily to the net proceeds received from sales of shares of common stock to intuitive surgical of million  the sale of shares of common stock to aspire capital of million and proceeds from the exercise of options of  offset in part by the million repayment of notes payable to century 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal was due primarily to million of net proceeds received from sales of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock in september  offset in part by  of notes payable to century that were repaid in april we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the cash that we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted through march   excluding the repayment of the million debt principal outstanding 
we would be able to extend this time period to the extent that we decrease our planned expenditures  or access additional capital under our purchase agreement with aspire  or under the atm agreement with mlv 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  including assumptions with respect to the level of revenue from product sales  and the cost of product development  including the cost and timing of our european clinical trial and the process for obtaining fda approval for the commercial use of our microcutter products in the united states  and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the sufficiency of our current cash resources and our need for additional capital  and the timing thereof  will depend upon numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following european market acceptance of our microcutter xchange which we anticipate launching in the second half of calendar year  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs and related costs  including costs related to the continued development of the microcutter xchange  the microcutter xchange  the microcutter xpress and additional potential products in our anticipated microcutter product line  our ability to enter into additional license  development and or collaboration agreements with respect to our technology  and the terms thereof  market acceptance and adoption of our current products or future products that we may commercialize  our level of revenues  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  costs and timing of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals for our products and potential additional products  securing  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights and the costs thereof  the extent to which we access additional capital under the purchase agreement with aspire capital  or under the atm agreement with mlv  and the effects of competing technological and market developments 
while we initiated first in man use of the current version of the microcutter xpress  with the ce mark  in europe in july  the microcutter xpress did not perform satisfactorily in a small number of deployments in tissue thicknesses that could be considered the upper range typically compatible with the size of staple used in the procedures  and we suspended our clinical trial and the use of this product to make modifications to address these issues 
we have shifted our development priority to the microcutter xchange  to which we applied the ce mark in march  following the completion of design verification 
we intend to continue to develop both of these microcutter products 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we will generate commercial revenue from the sale of either of these products or any other potential products in our anticipated microcutter product line 
because we do not anticipate that we will generate sufficient product sales to achieve profitability for the foreseeable future  if at all  we need to raise substantial additional capital to finance our operations in the future 
until we can generate significant continuing revenue  if ever  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through our purchase agreement with aspire capital or our atm agreement with mlv  public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
to raise capital  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility or enter into product development  license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our commercialized products or products in development 
however  we cannot be certain that additional funding of any kind will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  particularly in light of the prices at which our common stock has been recently trading 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any product development  licensing  distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights  including with respect to commercialized products or products in development that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
our need to raise capital may require us to accept terms that may harm our business or be disadvantageous to our current stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available or revenue from product sales do not increase  we would be required to reduce our workforce  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts with respect to one or more of our products or one or more of our research and development programs in advance of march   to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to preserve stockholder value 
contractual obligations our future contractual obligations at june   were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total operating lease obligations note payable  including interest total recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu no 
changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   and must be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the guidance will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the updated guidance amends the fasb accounting standards codification codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both alternatives  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu no 
will be applied retrospectively 
asu no 
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted  and will be applied retrospectively 
we do not expect that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on the presentation of comprehensive income within our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the updated guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the revised guidance to impact our results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose or variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at june  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and marketable securities and are held for working capital purposes 
the marketable securities were invested primarily in corporate debt securities  commercial papers  and certificates of deposits 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe we do not have material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
