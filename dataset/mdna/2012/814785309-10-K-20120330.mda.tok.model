mortgage operations over of the company s revenues and expenses are through its wholly owned subsidiary  securitynational mortgage 
securitynational mortgage is a mortgage lender incorporated under the laws of the state of utah 
securitynational mortgage is approved and regulated by the federal housing administration fha  a department of the us department of housing and urban development hud  to originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower 
securitynational mortgage obtains loans primarily from its mortgage sales offices and independent brokers 
securitynational mortgage funds the loans from internal cash flows  including loan purchase agreements from security national life  and with unaffiliated financial institutions 
securitynational mortgage receives fees from the borrowers and other secondary fees from third party investors that purchase its loans 
securitynational mortgage sells its loans to third party investors and does not usually retain servicing of these loans 
securitynational mortgage pays the brokers and retail loan officers a commission for loans that are brokered through securitynational mortgage 
for the twelve months ended december   and  securitynational mortgage originated and sold  loans  total volume   loans  total volume  and  loans  total volume  respectively 
the loan volume in was lower than primarily due to reduced refinancing activity in for the first six months of  the loan volume was primarily compared to home purchases and was lower from the same period in due to the slow down in the economy  the reduced demand in the housing sector  and new regulations affecting mortgage origination and lending activities 
for the third and fourth quarters of  the loan volume increased from the previous two quarters due to new office openings and an increase in retail sales production 
securitynational mortgage anticipates the loan volume for to remain at the  to  per month range 
securitynational mortgage continues to monitor staff size and funding costs  and will make adjustments based on levels of loan production 
securitynational mortgage has entered into a loan purchase agreement to originate and sell mortgage loans to an unaffiliated warehouse bank 
the amount available to originate loans under this agreement at december  was  securitynational mortgage originates the loans and immediately sells them to third party investors 
generally  when mortgage loans are sold to warehouse banks  securitynational mortgage is no longer obligated  except in certain circumstances as noted below in the mortgage accounting policy section  to pay the amounts outstanding on the mortgage loans  but is required to pay a fee in the form of interest on a portion of the mortgage loans between the date that the loans are sold to warehouse banks and the settlement date with third party investors 
the terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year  with interest accruing on a portion of the mortgage loans at annual rates ranging from to over the day libor rate 
securitynational mortgage renewed its loan purchase agreement with an unaffiliated warehouse bank  which had expired on december   for an indefinite period 
the following table shows the condensed financial results for the year  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december in thousands of dollars vs increase decrease vs increase decrease revenues from external customers revenues from loan originations secondary gains from investors total earnings losses before income taxes the losses for the twelve months ended december  was due to the lower loan volume and lower secondary gains from investors 
however  there were earnings in the third and fourth quarters for due to increased loan volume during that period 
mortgage accounting policy mortgage fee income consists of origination fees  processing fees  and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
for mortgage loans sold to third party investors  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles at the time the sales of the mortgage loans comply with the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets 
the sales criteria is as follows i the transferred assets have been isolated from securitynational mortgage and its creditors  ii the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage  and iii securitynational mortgage does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage 
securitynational mortgage must determine that all three sales criteria are met at the time a mortgage loan is funded 
all rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors  including investor commitments for the loans made prior to warehouse banks purchasing the loans under the purchase commitments 
as of december   there was  in mortgage loans in which settlements with third party investors were still pending 
securitynational mortgage sells all mortgage loans to third party investors without recourse 
however  it may be required to repurchase a loan or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events  which include the following failure to deliver original documents specified by the investor 
the existence of misrepresentation or fraud in the origination of the loan 
the loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold 
early pay off of a loan  as defined by the agreements 
excessive time to settle a loan 
investor declines purchase 
discontinued product and expired commitment 
loan purchase commitments generally specify a date to days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled 
depending on market conditions  these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to securitynational mortgage 
generally  a ten day extension will cost 
basis points of the loan amount 
securitynational mortgage s historical data shows that of all loans originated are generally settled by the investors as agreed within days after delivery 
there are situations  however  when securitynational mortgage determines that it is unable to enforce the settlement of loans rejected by the third party investors and that it is in its best interest to repurchase those loans from the warehouse banks 
it is securitynational mortgage s policy to cure any documentation problems regarding such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce loan purchase commitments from third party investors concerning the loans 
securitynational mortgage believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues  to enforce purchase commitments  and to exhaust other alternatives 
remedial methods include the following research reasons for rejection 
provide additional documents 
request investor exceptions 
appeal rejection decision to purchase committee 
commit to secondary investors 
once purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted  which could be earlier than the six month time period  the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or market value and previously recorded sales revenue is reversed 
any loan that later becomes delinquent is evaluated by securitynational mortgage at that time and any impairment is adjusted accordingly 
determining lower of cost or market 
cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by securitynational mortgage 
market value  while often difficult to determine  is based on the following guidelines for loans that have an active market  securitynational mortgage uses the market price on the repurchase date 
for loans where there is no market but there is a similar product  securitynational mortgage uses the market value for the similar product on the repurchase date 
for loans where no active market exists on the repurchase date  securitynational mortgage determines that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchase date  after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows 
the appraised value of the real estate underlying the original mortgage loan adds significance to securitynational mortgage s determination of fair value because  if the loan becomes delinquent  securitynational mortgage has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan 
in determining the market value on the date of repurchase  securitynational mortgage considers the total value of all of the loans because any sale of loans would be made as a pool 
for mortgages originated and held for investment  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized when the loan is originated 
mortgage loan repurchases and delinquencies the mortgage industry is still experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
securitynational mortgage funded  of its production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings in august securitynational mortgage believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  securitynational mortgage discontinued offering these loans in september as a result of the volatile secondary market for mortgage loans  securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans in and to certain third party investors  including lehman brothers aurora loan services and bear stearns emc mortgage corp 
that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of these loans was  of which  were loans in which the secondary market no longer existed 
due to these changes in circumstances  securitynational mortgage regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of assets from former transferees in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment purposes  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge offs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the  and financial statements reflect the transfer of mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
as standard in the industry  securitynational mortgage receives payments on the mortgage loans during the time period between the sale date and settlement or repurchase date 
also during this period  securitynational mortgage services these loans 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount   of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received or recognized any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days

settlement with wells fargo on april   securitynational mortgage  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a settlement agreement with wells fargo funding  inc wells fargo 
the settlement agreement provides that it is intended to be a pragmatic commercial accommodation between securitynational mortgage and wells fargo and is not to be construed as an admission of responsibility  liability or fault in regards to either party s claims 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  securitynational mortgage paid an initial settlement amount to wells fargo in the amount of  of which  had already been paid to wells fargo in january  leaving a balance of  the  balance was paid shortly after the parties executed the settlement agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the settlement agreement  wells fargo has the right to deduct basis points 
from the purchase proceeds of each loan that securitynational mortgage sells to wells fargo during the period from april  to march  from april  to december   wells fargo deducted a total of  representing basis points from the purchase proceeds of the loans that securitynational mortgage sold to wells fargo during that period 
securitynational mortgage is also required under the settlement agreement to set aside basis points 
during the period from april  to march  from the purchase proceeds of any loans that it sells to any mortgage loan purchaser other than wells fargo and pay such amounts to wells fargo 
from april  to december   securitynational mortgage paid wells fargo a total of  representing basis points from the purchase proceeds of the loans it sold to mortgage loan purchasers other than wells fargo during that period 
finally  securitynational mortgage is required under the settlement agreement to set aside from the net proceeds that it receives from any sale  liquidation or other transfer of certain real estate properties that it owns  after subtracting taxes  commissions  recording fees and other transaction costs 
these real estate properties consist of real estate properties with a total book value of  as of december  in consideration for securitynational mortgage making the initial settlement payment to wells fargo  wells fargo and related parties  including wells fargo bank  released securitynational mortgage and related parties  including the company and security national life insurance company  from any claims  demands  damages  obligations  liabilities  or causes of action relating to residential mortgage loans that wells fargo purchased from securitynational mortgage prior to december  similarly  securitynational mortgage released wells fargo and its related parties from any claims  demands  damages  obligations  liabilities  or causes of actions relating to residential mortgage loans that wells fargo purchased from securitynational mortgage prior to december  securitynational mortgage is not aware of any repurchase or indemnification demands by wells fargo for residential mortgage loans with a closing date after december  as of december   the company reserved and accrued  to settle investor related claims against securitynational mortgage for the allegedly defective mortgage loans that securitynational mortgage sold to wells fargo and other mortgage loan purchasers 
mortgage loan loss demands there have been assertions in third party investor correspondence that securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults  or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with agreements between securitynational mortgage and the third party investors consisting principally of financial institutions 
as a result of these claims  third party investors have made demands that securitynational mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans 
as of december   third party investors had asserted total potential claims and notices of potential claims relating to mortgage loan repurchases  indemnifications and other issues that are substantially greater than  additional potential claims and notices of potential claims from third party investors have been made since december  the company has reserved and accrued  as of december  to settle all such investor related claims 
the total amount of potential claims and notices of potential claims are greater than the net asset value of securitynational mortgage  which was  on december   and its reserve for mortgage loan loss  which was  on december  securitynational mortgage disagrees with the claims and notices of potential claims asserted by third party investors against it and believes it has significant defenses to these claims 
any additional losses in excess of the current loan loss reserve cannot be estimated as securitynational mortgage is currently in the process of reviewing repurchase demands and notices of potential claims from third party investors 
if securitynational mortgage is unable to resolve demands by the third party investors on acceptable terms  legal action may ensue in an effort to obtain amounts that the third party investors claim are allegedly due 
in the event of legal action  if securitynational mortgage is not successful in its defenses against claims asserted by these third party investors to the extent that a substantial judgment is entered against securitynational mortgage which is beyond its capacity to pay  securitynational mortgage may be required to curtail or cease operations 
during settlement discussions with one of the third party investors during the second and third quarters of  the investor made a settlement proposal to securitynational mortgage 
when securitynational mortgage declined to accept the settlement proposal because it regarded the language in the settlement documents as unreasonable  the investor notified securitynational mortgage by letter dated october  of its decision to terminate its business relationship with securitynational mortgage 
the investor also stated in the october  letter that termination of its business relationship with securitynational mortgage would not affect the obligations  representations  warranties or indemnifications by securitynational mortgage under mortgage loans previously sold to the investor under a loan purchase agreement 
the investor further stated that it intended to exercise certain rights under a loan purchase agreement by debiting  from amounts in an over under account that it had been holding for the benefit of securitynational mortgage 
securitynational mortgage believes the investor wrongfully applied the  from the over under account toward payment of outstanding obligations that securitynational mortgage allegedly owed to the investor 
the investor has asserted potential claims and notices of potential claims concerning the alleged defective loans that securitynational mortgage sold to such investor 
securitynational mortgage disagrees with these potential claims and notices and believes it has significant defenses to such claims and notices  as well as a claim against the investor for the return of the  that the investor had wrongfully taken from the over under account 
jp morgan chase indemnification demand the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  securitynational mortgage  received a notice of claim for indemnification relating to mortgage loans that emc mortgage  llc emc mortgage allegedly purchased as a third party investor from securitynational mortgage 
the notice was from jp morgan chase co 
jp morgan chase in behalf of emc mortgage 
according to the notice  the alleged indemnification claims relate to mortgage loans that securitynational mortgage sold to emc mortgage under a mortgage loan purchase agreement  dated december   between securitynational mortgage and emc 
the notice also referenced an agreement of guaranty  dated february   by the company relative to emc mortgage 
the notice states that emc mortgage allegedly purchased mortgage loans from securitynational mortgage  which were later securitized by means of mortgage pass through certificates 
the notice of indemnification claims from jp morgan chase also states that emc mortgage has been named in a lawsuit by the bear stearns mortgage funding trust ar the trust  which was filed on september  in the delaware court of chancery 
a copy of the complaint and the amended complaint has been provided by jp morgan chase 
the amended complaint contends that more than residential mortgage loans that emc mortgage sold to the trust contained breaches of representations and warranties concerning the mortgage loans 
the amended complaint also contends that despite emc mortgage s assurance to the trust that the mortgage loans met certain minimum quality standards  there have been defaults and foreclosures in many of such loans 
as a result of the alleged defaults and foreclosures  the amended complaint asserts that emc mortgage is required to repurchase from the trust any loans for which it breached its representations and warranties  in the amount of the mortgage loans outstanding principal balance and all accrued but unpaid interest 
the notice from jp morgan chase further states that the company and securitynational mortgage are required to indemnify emc mortgage for any losses arising from the lawsuit against emc based upon alleged untrue statements of material fact related to information that was provided by securitynational mortgage 
the amended complaint includes the loan numbers of the alleged non complying mortgage loans that emc mortgage sold to the trust 
in a letter from jp morgan chase accompanying a copy of the amended complaint  jp morgan chase asserted that mortgage loans originated by securitynational mortgage were included in the lawsuit as part of the alleged non complying mortgage loans that emc allegedly sold to the trust 
thus  it appears that only a very small percentage of the alleged non complying mortgage loans that emc mortgage sold to the trust were mortgage loans that securitynational mortgage had sold to emc 
moreover  to the extent the claims by the trust against emc mortgage relate to mortgage loans that securitynational mortgage sold to emc  the company believes it has defenses to such claims with respect to emc 
for example  neither the company nor securitynational mortgage is a party to any agreement involving the trust  nor are they privy to any agreements between emc mortgage and the trust 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself and securitynational mortgage in the event that jp morgan chase were to bring any legal action to require the company or securitynational mortgage to indemnify it for any loss  liability or expense in connection with the lawsuit that the trust has brought against emc mortgage

the purpose of the funeral plan policy is to pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of the person s death 
on a per thousand dollar cost of insurance basis these policies can be more expensive to the policy holder than many types of non burial insurance due to their low face amount  requiring the fixed cost of the policy administration be distributed over a smaller policy size  and the simplified underwriting practices that result in higher mortality costs

significant accounting policies the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting  asset liability duration matching  sound actuarial practices  adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets  including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets  are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
under gaap  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of fasb codification topic  described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed 
prearranged funeral and pre need cemetery customer obtaining costs costs incurred related to obtaining new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of gaap related to financial services insurance 
obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists  the services are performed  collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with gaap related to sales of financial assets 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors  and include the fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  amount of death and surrender benefits  and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
value of business acquired value of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of receivables due on mortgage loans sold to investors  cemetery and mortuary operations  mortgage loan operations and other receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issue that would impact recovery of the cemetery and mortuary receivables is the overall economy 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have significant policy initiation fees front end load that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
the company  through its cemetery and mortuary operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage allowance for loan loss and loan loss reserve the company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses a contra asset account and through the mortgage loan loss reserve a liability account 
the allowance for loan losses is an allowance for losses on the company s mortgage loans held for investment 
the allowance is comprised of two components 
the first component is an allowance for collectively evaluated impairment that is based upon the company s historical experience in collecting similar receivables 
the second component is based upon individual evaluation of loans that are determined to be impaired 
upon determining impairment the company establishes an individual impairment allowance based upon an assessment of the fair value of the underlying collateral 
when a mortgage loan is past due more than days  the company  where appropriate  sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral 
once a loan is past due more than days the company does not accrue any interest income and proceeds to foreclose on the real estate 
all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred 
once foreclosed the carrying value will approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate owned 
the company carries the foreclosed property in security national life  memorial estates and securitynational mortgage  its life  cemeteries and mortuaries and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is deemed desirable to sell them 
the company is currently able to rent properties at a to gross return 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
the company s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
upon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale  the company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions 
the company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on total production 
this estimate is based on the company s historical experience 
the amount accrued for and the charge to expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
deferred compensation the company has deferred compensation agreements with several of its current and past executive officers 
the deferred compensation is payable upon retirement or death of these individuals either in annual installments ten years or lump sum settlement  if approved by the board of directors 
the company has accrued the present value of these benefits based upon their future retirement dates and other factors  on its consolidated financial statements 
depreciation depreciation is calculated principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain casualty insurance  workers compensation and liability programs 
self insurance reserves are maintained relative to these programs 
the level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverage 
when estimating the self insurance liabilities and related reserves  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided independent third party actuaries 
management reviews its assumptions with its independent third party administrators and actuaries to evaluate whether the self insurance reserves are adequate 
if actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates  additional reserves may be required 
the estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date

risks the following is a description of the most significant risks facing the company and how it mitigates those risks legal and regulatory risks the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the company operates will create additional expenses and or risks not anticipated by the company in developing and pricing its products 
that is  regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits  new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the company s mortgage sales 
also  the company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery mortuary business 
the company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations  thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction  and also by employing underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks 
mortgage industry risks developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets adversely affected the company s ability to sell certain of its mortgage loans to investors  which impacted the company s financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing many of these loans 
as a result of the volatile secondary market  for mortgage loans  securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans in and to certain third party investors  including lehman brothers aurora loan services and bear stearns emc mortgage corp 
that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of the loans was  of which  were loans in which the secondary market no longer exists 
due to these changes in circumstances  the company regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of assets from former transferees in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment purposes  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for charge offs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the  and financial statements reflect the transfer of the mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
securitynational mortgage may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
securitynational mortgage s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
upon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale  securitynational mortgage initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions 
securitynational mortgage accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors based on securitynational mortgage s historical experience 
the amounts accrued for loan losses in years ended december   and were   and  respectively  and the charge to expense has been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses and  as of december  and  the balances were  and  respectively 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of december  however  there is a risk that future loan losses may exceed the loan loss reserves and allowances 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio consisted of  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount   of the loans were in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received or recognized any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
during the twelve months ended december  and  securitynational mortgage increased its allowance for mortgage losses by  and  respectively  which was charged to loan loss expense and included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the period 
the allowances for mortgage loan losses as of december  and were  and  respectively 
there have been assertions in third party investor correspondence that securitynational mortgage sold mortgage loans that allegedly contained misrepresentations or experienced early payment defaults  or that were otherwise allegedly defective or not in compliance with agreements between securitynational mortgage and the third party investors consisting principally of financial institutions 
as a result of these claims  third party investors have made demands that securitynational mortgage repurchase certain alleged defective mortgage loans that were sold to such investors or indemnify them against any losses related to such loans 
as of december   third party investors had asserted total potential claims and notices of potential claims relating to mortgage loan repurchases  indemnifications and other issues that are substantially greater than  additional potential claims and notices of potential claims from third party investors have been made since december  the company has reserved and accrued  as of december  to settle all such investor related claims 
the total amount of potential claims and notices of potential claims are greater than the net asset value of securitynational mortgage  which was  on december   and its reserve for mortgage loan loss  which was  on december  securitynational mortgage disagrees with the claims and notices of potential claims asserted by third party investors against it and believes it has significant defenses to these claims 
any additional losses in excess of the current loan loss reserve cannot be estimated as securitynational mortgage is currently in the process of reviewing repurchase demands and notices of potential claims from third party investors 
if securitynational mortgage is unable to resolve demands by the third party investors on acceptable terms  legal action may ensue in an effort to obtain amounts that the third party investors claim are allegedly due 
in the event of legal action  if securitynational mortgage is not successful in its defenses against claims asserted by these third party investors to the extent that a substantial judgment is entered against securitynational mortgage which is beyond its capacity to pay  securitynational mortgage may be required to curtail or cease operations 
also at december   the company had foreclosed on a total of  in long term mortgage loans  of which  of the loans foreclosed were reclassified as other real estate held for investment or sale during the company carries the foreclosed properties in security national life  memorial estates  and securitynational mortgage  its respective life  cemeteries and mortuaries  and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is deemed economically desirable to sell them 
interest rate risk the risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the company s investments or impair the ability of the company to market its mortgage and cemetery mortuary products 
this change in rates may cause certain interest sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation 
the company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non conformance with certain policy provisions  by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser  and or by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities 
to the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature  the company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale 
mortality morbidity risk the risk that the company s actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality morbidity experience may cause the company s products to be underpriced  may cause the company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated and other potentially adverse consequences to the business 
the company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices  asset liability duration matching  and sound actuarial practices 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and claims  those used in determining valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  construction loans  estimate of probable loan loss reserve  and other receivables  and those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre need sales 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
during the twelve months ended december   the company s operations provided cash of  while cash totaling  was used by operations during the twelve months ended december  this was due primarily to a  increase in and an increase of  in in the balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
the company s liability for future life  annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over long term due to the company s market niche of selling funeral plans 
funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person s death 
a person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person s death 
because of the long term nature of these liabilities the company is able to hold to maturity its bonds  real estate and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return  which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this represents and of the total investments as of december   and december   respectively 
generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds 
at december   or  and at december   or  of the company s total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six  which are considered non investment grade 
the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities and for the schedule of principal payments for mortgage loans on real estate and construction loans held for investment 
if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately  could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique bps bps bps bps change in market value in thousands the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december   and december   the life insurance subsidiary exceeded the regulatory criteria 
the company s total capitalization of stockholders equity  and bank debt and notes payable were  as of december   as compared to  as of december  stockholders equity as a percent of total capitalization was and as of december  and december   respectively 
bank debt and notes payable increased  for the twelve months ended december  when compared to december   thus decreasing the stockholders equity percentage 
lapse rates measure the amount of insurance terminated during a particular period 
the company s lapse rate for life insurance in was as compared to a rate of for at december    of the company s consolidated stockholders equity represents the statutory stockholders equity of the company s life insurance subsidiaries 
the life insurance subsidiaries cannot pay a dividend to its parent company without the approval of insurance regulatory authorities

off balance sheet agreements at december   the company was contingently liable under a standby letter of credit aggregating  to be used as collateral to cover any contingency related to additional risk assessments pertaining to the company s self insurance casualty program 
the company does not expect any material losses to result from the issuance of the standby letter of credit because claims are not expected to exceed premiums paid
