interest rate risk with respect to accumulation and investment oriented products  we seek to earn a stable and profitable spread  or margin  between investment income we earn on our invested assets and interest credited to account values of our contract holders 
if we have adverse experience on investments that cannot be passed on to customers  our spreads are reduced 
the combination of a probable range of interest rate changes over the next months  asset liability management strategies  flexibility in adjusting policy crediting rate levels and protection afforded by policy surrender all work together to mitigate this risk 
the interest rate scenarios of concern are those in which there is a substantial  relatively prolonged decrease in interest rates that is sustained over a long period or a rapid increase in interest rates

interest rate risk on fixed insurance businesses falling rates in periods of declining interest rates  we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments 
moreover  borrowers may prepay fixed income securities  commercial mortgages and mortgage backed securities in our general accounts in order to borrow at lower market rates  which exacerbate this risk 
because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited  pre established intervals  and because many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates  our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative 
prolonged historically low rates are not healthy for our business fundamentals 
however  we have recognized this threat and have been proactive in our investment strategies  product designs  crediting rate strategies and overall asset liability practices to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences in this type of environment 
for some time now  new products have been sold with low minimum crediting floors  and we apply disciplined asset liability management standards  such as locking in spreads on these products at the time of issue 
the following summarizes a hypothetical stress scenario related to the effect of continued low new money rates relative to our portfolio yields 
the scenario assumes modest improvements in our new money rates from the current average of approximately to basis points below our portfolio yields  which would result in spreads in our businesses declining from levels 
life insurance the stress on earnings has been mitigated by proactive strategies to lock in long dated and high yielding assets to manage this risk 
we executed on strategies which allowed us to effectively pre buy assets in anticipation of future flows and maturing securities 
we have also taken actions on crediting rates 
we estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of million to million during  million to million during and million to million during our deferred acquisition costs dac  value of business acquired voba  and deferred front end loads dfel methodology assumes that new money rates grade from current levels to a long term yield assumption over time 
retirement plan services and annuities the earnings drag from spread compression is modest and largely concentrated in our retirement plan services segment  which is a function of this segment having higher guaranteed crediting rates and recurring premiums 
we estimate that this scenario would have an approximate unfavorable earnings effect in a range of million to million during  million to million during and million to million during since we currently have the ability to manage spread compression through crediting rate actions  our annuities segment is not currently sensitive to spread compression so there is very little effect estimated 
the risk for our annuities segment is sensitivity to sharp rising rates  and we manage this risk by selling market value adjusted products and purchasing derivative protection 
the costs of our derivative instruments that we use to hedge our variable annuity products may increase as a result of the low interest rate environment 
group protection we reviewed the discount rate assumptions associated with our long term disability claim reserves and life waiver claim incurrals during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in no change to the discount rate 
spread compression would unfavorably affect annualized earnings by up to million during  million during and million during other operations we may also be affected by sensitivity to our exposures in our institutional pension and disability run off blocks of business that are sensitive to interest rates and could contribute to an effect 
we believe that applying this same hypothetical scenario to statutory earnings would produce similar percentage changes to earnings effects to those disclosed above 
in isolation  we believe the effects to our balance sheet from sustained low interest rates under this scenario would be modest assuming no changes to our long term yield assumption and also excluding the effects of the new dac methodology discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction critical accounting policies and estimates dac  voba  dsi and dfel new dac methodology 
with regard to our goodwill balance  low interest rates generally support a lower discount rate and therefore a higher goodwill implied fair value 
the estimates above are based upon a hypothetical stressed scenario and are only representative of the effects of new money rates remaining in place through keeping all else equal and does not give consideration to the aggregate effect of other factors  including but not limited to contract holder activity  hedge positions  changing equity markets  shifts in implied volatilities  and changes in other capital market sectors 
in addition  the scenario only illustrated the effect to spreads and certain unlocking and reserve changes 
minimum guaranteed rates on annuity and universal life ul policies generally range from to 
other potential effects of the scenario were not considered in the analysis 
see part i item a 
risk factors market conditions changes in interest rates and sustained low interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and changes in interest rates may also result in increased contract withdrawals for additional information on interest rates 
the following provides detail on the percentage differences between the december   interest rates being credited to contract holders based on fourth quarter of declared rates and the respective minimum guaranteed policy rate in millions  broken out by contract holder account values reported within our segments account values retirement plan life account annuities services insurance total values excess of crediting rates over contract minimums discretionary rate setting products no difference up to to to to to to to to to to to to to to and above total discretionary rate setting products other contracts total account values percentage of discretionary rate setting product account values at minimum guaranteed rates excludes policy loans 
contracts currently within new money rate bands are grouped according to the corresponding portfolio rate band in which they will fall upon their first anniversary 
the average crediting rates for discretionary rate setting products were basis points  basis points and basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for our annuities  retirement plan services and life insurance segments  respectively 
for annuities  this amount relates primarily to multi year guarantee and indexed renewal business 
the average crediting rates were basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates for multi year guarantee products   and of our total multi year guarantee account values are scheduled to reset in  and and beyond  respectively 
our indexed renewal business resets either annually or bi annually 
upon reset  we are able to adjust product features to reflect changes in option prices 
for retirement plan services  this amount relates to indexed based rate setting products in which the average crediting rates were basis points in excess of average minimum guaranteed rates and of account values were already at their minimum guaranteed rates 
the maturity structure and call provisions of the related portfolios are structured to afford protection against erosion of investment portfolio yields during periods of declining interest rates 
we devote extensive effort to evaluating the risks associated with falling interest rates by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
we seek to manage these exposures by maintaining a suitable maturity structure and by limiting our exposure to call risk in each respective investment portfolio 
interest rate risk on fixed insurance businesses rising rates for both annuities and ul  a rapid rise in interest rates poses risks of deteriorating spreads and high surrenders 
the portfolios supporting these products have fixed rate assets laddered over maturities generally ranging from to years or more 
accordingly  the earned rate on each portfolio lags behind changes in market yields 
as rates rise  the lag may be increased by slowing mortgage backed securities prepayments 
the greater and faster the rise in interest rates  the more the earned rate will tend to lag behind market rates 
if we set renewal crediting rates to earn the desired spread  the gap between our renewal crediting rates and competitors new money rates may be wide enough to cause increased surrenders that could cause us to liquidate a portion of our portfolio to fund these surrenders 
if we credit more competitive renewal rates to limit surrenders  our spreads will narrow 
we devote extensive effort to evaluating these risks by simulating asset and liability cash flows for a wide range of interest rate scenarios 
such analysis has led to adjustments in the target maturity structure and to hedging the risk of rising rates by buying out of the money interest rate cap agreements and swaptions 
with these instruments in place  the potential adverse effect of a rapid and sustained rise in rates is kept within our risk tolerances 
debt we manage the timing of maturities and the mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt as part of the process of integrated management of interest rate risk for the entire enterprise

foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency denominated investments we invest in foreign currency securities for incremental return and risk diversification relative to united states dollar denominated securities 
we use foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forwards to hedge some of the foreign exchange risk related to our investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies 
the currency risk is hedged using foreign currency derivatives of the same currency as the bonds

due to the use of our reversion to the mean rtm process and our hedging strategies  we expect that  in general  short term fluctuations in the equity markets should not have a significant effect on our quarterly earnings from unlocking of assumptions for dac  voba  deferred sales inducements dsi and dfel 
however  earnings are affected by equity market movements on account values and assets under management and the related fees we earn on those assets

fee revenues the fees earned from variable annuities and variable life insurance products are exposed to the risk of a decline in equity market values 
these fees are generally a fixed percentage of the market value of assets under management 
in a severe equity market decline  fee income could be reduced by not only reduced market valuations but also by customer withdrawals and redemptions 
such withdrawals and redemptions from equity funds and accounts might be partially offset by transfers to our fixed income accounts and the transfer of funds to us from our competitors customers 
assets while we invest in equity assets with the expectation of achieving higher returns than would be available in our core fixed income investments  the returns on and values of these equity investments are subject to somewhat greater market risk than our fixed income investments 
these investments  however  add diversification benefits to our fixed income investments

effect of equity market sensitivity the following presents our estimate of the effect on income loss from operations in millions  from the change in asset based fees and related expenses  if the level of the standard poor s s p index s p  which ended at as of december   were to decrease to over six months after december   and remain at that level through the next six months or increase to over six months after december   and remain at that level through the next six months  excluding any effect related to sales  prospective unlocking  persistency  hedge program performance or customer behavior caused by the equity market change s p s p at at segment annuities retirement plan services the baseline for these effects assumes a annual equity market growth rate  depending on the block of business  beginning on january  the baseline is then compared to scenarios of s p at the and levels  which assume the index moves to those levels over six months  remains at those levels through the next six months and grows at annually  depending on the block of business  thereafter 
the difference between the baseline and s p at the and level scenarios is presented in the table 
refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction critical accounting policies and estimates dac  voba  dsi and dfel reversion to the mean for discussion on the effects of equity markets on our rtm 
the effect on earnings summarized above is a hypothetical scenario for the next months 
the effect of quarterly equity market changes upon fee revenues and asset based expenses is generally not fully recognized in the first quarter of the change because fee revenues are earned and related expenses are incurred based upon daily variable account values 
the difference between the current period average daily variable account values compared to the end of period variable account values affects fee revenues in subsequent periods 
additionally  the effect on earnings may not necessarily be symmetrical with comparable increases in the equity markets 
this discussion concerning the estimated effects of ongoing equity market volatility on the fees we earn from account values and assets under management is intended to be illustrative 
actual effects may vary depending on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  such as changing customer behaviors that might result in changes in the mix of our business between variable and fixed annuity contracts  switching among investment alternatives available within variable products  changes in sales production levels or changes in policy persistency 
for purposes of this guidance  the change in account values is assumed to correlate with the change in the relevant index 
default risk our portfolio of invested assets was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
of this total  billion and billion consisted of corporate bonds and billion and billion consisted of mortgage loans on real estate as of december  and  respectively 
we manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined credit evaluation and underwriting standards  prudently limiting allocations to lower quality  higher yielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  our exposures from all transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to formal limits set by rating quality 
additional diversification limits  such as limits per industry  are also applied 
we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
we depend on the ability of derivative product dealers and their guarantors to honor their obligations to pay the contract amounts under various derivatives agreements 
in order to minimize the risk of default losses  we diversify our exposures among several dealers and limit the amount of exposure to each in accordance with the credit rating of each dealer or its guarantor 
we generally limit our selection of counterparties that are obligated under these derivative contracts to those with an a credit rating or above 
credit related derivatives we use credit related derivatives to minimize our exposure to credit related events and we also sell credit default swaps to offer credit protection to our contract holders and investors
