item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bank holding company for plumas bank  a california state chartered commercial bank 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related  commercial and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale of loans 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating in california  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in california  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the bank s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are applied in an environment that is designed and operating effectively and applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through a provision for loan losses which is charged to expense 
additions to the allowance are expected to maintain the adequacy of the total allowance after credit losses and loan growth 
credit exposures determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance 
cash received on previously charged off amounts is recorded as a recovery to the allowance 
the overall allowance consists of two primary components  specific reserves related to impaired loans and general reserves for inherent losses related to loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans 
we cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio  which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established 
other real estate owned 
other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
oreo is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo is charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
income taxes 
the company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary 
the allocation of income tax expense benefit represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes 

table of contents deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
when tax returns are filed  it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes will be appropriate to absorb inherent losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of the loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio 
however  no assurance can be given that the company may not sustain charge offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period

partially offsetting these declines in income was a thousand increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans 
gains on sale in were particularly strong related to two factors 
first  during the first quarter of the sba eliminated the recourse provision related to loan sales allowing us to record both gains on sales from loans sold during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in addition  many loans sold in were guaranteed related to a temporary increase in guarantee percentage enacted on february  as part of the recovery act 
currently loans made through the sba a program carry a to guarantee

we expect government guaranteed lending activity to remain strong in  however  we anticipate a reduction in gains on sale during loan servicing fees increased by thousand to thousand for the year ended december  loan servicing fees are primarily related to fees earned for servicing the sold portion of sba loans and the increase in this category is consistent with the increase in sold sba loans

previously we had leased this building 
under the terms of the lease agreement we were provided free rent for a period of time  however  in accordance with accounting principals we recognized monthly rent expense equal to the total payments required under the lease dividend by the term of the lease in months 
at the time of the purchase we reversed this accrual recognizing a thousand reduction in occupancy costs 
in addition to the one time savings from the reversal of accrued rent we benefit from reduced operating costs on this building as the owner rather than a renter

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the determination of the amount of deferred income tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized is primarily dependent on projections of future earnings  which are subject to uncertainty and estimates that may change given economic conditions and other factors 
the realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
more likely than not is defined as greater than a chance 
all available evidence  both positive and negative is considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 

table of contents as part of its analysis  the company considered the following positive evidence the company s net loss was largely attributable to losses on its construction and land development portfolio that represented approximately of net charge offs during the year ended december  this portfolio has decreased from million at december  to million at december the company s net loss was also attributable to significant write downs on foreclosed construction and land development real estate properties which represented the majority of its provision for losses on other real estate during during other real estate write downs decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to thousand during write downs on construction and land development real estate owned during totaled thousand

the company was profitable in and and is projecting future taxable and book income will be generated by operations 
the size of loans in the company s pipeline of potential problem loans has significantly decreased 
the company does not have a history of net operating losses carry forwards or tax credits expiring unused 
as part of its analysis  the company also considered the following negative evidence the company recorded a large net loss in and is in a cumulative loss position for the current and preceding two years 
based upon the analysis of available evidence  management has determined that it is more likely than not that all deferred income tax assets as of december  and will be fully realized and therefore no valuation allowance was recorded 
financial condition loan portfolio 
the company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves 
although the company offers a broad array of financing options  it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses 
these commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses  thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property  business assets and deposit accounts  but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment 
the company s largest lending categories are commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans  and agricultural loans 
these categories accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december   and approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december  construction and land development loans continue to decline and represented and of the loan portfolio as of december  and december   respectively 
the construction and land development portfolio component has been identified by management as a higher risk loan category 
the quality of the construction and land development category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the company has securing the loan in the event of default 
loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
the decline in these loans as a percentage of the company s loan portfolio reflects management s continued efforts  which began in  to reduce its exposure to construction and land development loans due to the severe valuation decrease in the real estate market 
the company s real estate related loans  including real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  consumer equity lines of credit  and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised and of the total loan portfolio at december  and december   respectively 
moreover  the business activities of the company currently are focused in the california counties of plumas  nevada  placer  lassen  modoc  shasta  sierra and in washoe county in northern nevada 
consequently  the results of operations and financial condition of the company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets 
in addition  the concentration of the company s operations in these areas of northeastern california and northwestern nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  fires and floods in these regions 

table of contents the rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the company s lending rate or other indexes such as the published prime interest rate or us treasury rates and vary with changes in these indexes 
at december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable rate loans 
while real estate mortgage  commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the company s historical loan mix  some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types 
in addition  the company remains committed to the agricultural industry in northeastern california and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans

the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans  including current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  collateral  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent credit reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and state of the local economy 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company follows these guidelines 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement was also revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in addition  the company incorporates the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which represents the sec staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 

table of contents the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements  which include but are not limited to specific allocation determined in accordance with asc topic receivables  based on probable losses on specific loans 
general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company 
specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified  impaired  and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original contractual terms of the loan agreement are in question 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are watch  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
watch loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful 
loans classified as loss are immediately charged off 
loans are consistently monitored against risk rating criteria 
as loans are identified that may warrant a classification change  they are discussed with the company s credit administration officers and appropriate risk grades are assigned 
there are several times in the life of a loan that this occurs loan origination loan renewal loan servicing actions change in terms  collateral release  etc 
annual financial review delinquency monitoring and follow up loan review process audit process if weaknesses or improvements are noted  a change in risk rating  if warranted by credit administration  will be made 
loans classified watch or below in an amount of  or more will be individually evaluated for impairment in accordance with the bank s policy for determining and measuring impairment 
formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
effective for the third quarter of  the company modified its method of estimating the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment 
this modification incorporated historical loss experience based on a rolling eight quarters ending with the most recently completed calendar quarter to identified pools of loans 
this modification did not have a material affect on the company s allowance for loans losses or provision for loan losses 
no modifications to the allowance for loan losses methodology were made in the discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 

table of contents the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity

general reserves decreased by thousand to million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased slightly from at december  to at december  the percentage of general reserves to unimpaired loans decreased from at december  to at december  primarily related to a decrease in charge offs during the eight quarters ending december  as compared to the eight quarters ended december  which resulted in a lower loss rate applied to unimpaired loans 

table of contents the company places loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring tdr if the company  for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider 
restructured workout loans typically present an elevated level of credit risk as the borrowers are not able to perform according to the original contractual terms 
loans that are reported as tdrs are considered impaired and measured for impairment as described above 
loans restructured and in compliance with modified terms totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
there were no troubled debt restructurings at december   or for additional information related to restructured loans see note of the company s consolidated financial statements in
