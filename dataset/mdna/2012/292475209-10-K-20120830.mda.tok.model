the market for networking infrastructure solutions is concentrated among large oems  and as such  a significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales to a limited number of customers 
as of july   we had a total of  employees 
we use a to week fiscal year that ends on the sunday nearest to june therefore  every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a week fiscal year 
the last week fiscal year was fiscal consolidation of facilities during fiscal  we commenced the consolidation of certain leased facilities in colorado and washington 
the consolidation of facilities was completed during the first quarter of fiscal total charges related to the facility consolidation and related workforce reductions were approximately million  of which million was recorded in fiscal and million was recorded in fiscal the charges consisted primarily of salaries and benefits based on continuous employment of affected employees through the facility closure dates 
in fiscal  the charges were comprised of salaries and benefits expense of approximately million  acceleration of rent expense of approximately million  and other costs of approximately million 
in fiscal  the charges were comprised of salaries and benefits expense of approximately million  acceleration of fixed assets depreciation expense of approximately million  and other costs of approximately million 
business combination on august   we acquired of the outstanding common shares of serverengines corporation serverengines  a privately held  fabless semiconductor company located in sunnyvale  california 
the combination of emulex and serverengines technology create a unique offering to deliver i o connectivity for converged networking solutions  including adapters  mezzanine cards and lan on motherboard lom solutions 
in addition  the acquisition adds the serverengines pilot family of baseboard management controllers  which reside on the motherboard  enabling remote ip based lights out management capabilities 
patent litigation broadcom corporation broadcom filed a consolidated patent infringement suit against us during fiscal after a nearly three week trial that ended october   the jury reached a partial verdict involving two out of the six patents 
the court determined that one of the patents us patent  
the patent 
had been infringed by us  and the jury rendered an advisory verdict on october  to the court that the patent is not invalid  and awarded approximately million in damages related to that patent 
the jury reached a unanimous verdict of non infringement on another patent relating to emulex fibre channel switch products 
a mistrial was declared on the remaining four patents including us patent  
the patent 
for which no unanimous verdict was reached 
subsequent to the trial  the court issued orders consistent with the advisory verdicts of invalidity  and issued an order that one additional patent us patent  
the patent 
had been infringed by us 
on march   the court issued a decision concerning injunctive relief for the and the patents 
the decision provided  in part  for a sunset period of months relating to the patent  starting on october  the decision further provided for a sunset period of months relating to the patent  starting on december  the sunset period allows emulex to sell the affected products to existing customers for specific customer devices  subject to limitations relating to when the products had been qualified 
table of contents by the customers and when certain firm orders had been placed 
the decision further provided for emulex to pay a royalty of nine percent on all sales of such products made during the sunset period 
the decision also clarified that foreign sales outside the us are beyond the scope of the suit 
on april   the court issued a permanent injunction which  with respect to both the and patents  further describe the prohibited activities  contain sunset provision terms including royalty rates and computations  limit the territory to allow sales of products that are manufactured outside the us to customers located outside the us  permit design around efforts including modifications and design  development  and testing to eliminate infringement  and permit service and technical support for certain products 
on april   we filed a notice of appeal for both the patent and patent infringement findings 
on july   we entered into a patent license and release agreement settlement agreement with broadcom pursuant to which both parties agreed to settle and release certain claims related to the patent infringement litigation 
the settlement agreement provided for certain amendments to the april  permanent injunction  and dismissals of certain allegations of the lawsuit  including portions of the scheduled re trial 
we also received a worldwide limited license to the patent  the patent  the patent and related families for certain fields of use including fibre channel applications 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid to broadcom a lump sum release and license fee of million in cash subsequent to fiscal on july   pursuant to the settlement agreement  the court issued an amended permanent injunction with an amended appendix and approved a stipulation to dismiss certain allegations in the lawsuit in light of the settlement agreement 
during fiscal  we accrued approximately million in damages related to the october  verdict and approximately million of sunset period royalty liability related to the july  amended injunction 
at the end of fiscal  we also accrued million to cost of goods sold pursuant to the settlement agreement related to settlement costs for our past sales of products 
the remaining million of the million settlement payment was determined to be related to patent license fees for our expected future sales of products and will be recorded as prepaid license fees in fiscal when the payment is made  and amortized to cost of goods sold over the license term in proportion to the estimated future revenues to such licensed technology 
we expect to incur incremental mitigation  product redesign and appeal related expenses during the next months related to the unsettled infringement findings in the range of million million 
engineering and development costs will include expenses for activities to redesign  design around  modify  design  develop  test and requalify certain of our affected products during the sunset period  and to implement our end of life processes in the us for certain other affected products 
sales and marketing costs are likely to include expenses for customer support  pre production samples  education and training  and other miscellaneous costs 
general and administrative costs will include expenses for our appeal of the previous verdicts and judgments

for fiscal year  our fibre channel based products accounted for approximately of total ncp revenues  however  our ethernet based products revenue grew by more than compared to fiscal the increase in our ncp net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in units shipped of approximately which was partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
we expect our ncp revenue to continue to grow in fiscal primarily due to sales of converged network products 
scp primarily consists of our inspeed  soc or backend connectivity  and bridge and router products 
the increase in our scp net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a ramp in shipments related to previously awarded design wins for certain bridging products and last time buys of certain end of life legacy products driving an increase in units shipped of approximately 
this increase in unit volume was partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
we expect our scp revenue to return to normal levels in fiscal  and primarily relate to bridging products 
atp primarily consists of our ibmcs  which are products previously sold by serverengines prior to our acquisition on august   onecommand vision software products  certain legacy products and other products and services 
for fiscal  our ibmc based products accounted for the majority of total atp revenues 
the increase in our atp revenue in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in units shipped of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchase or market products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded of our fiscal year net revenues were as follows net revenues by major customers direct revenues total direct and indirect revenues net revenue percentage oem hewlett packard ibm amounts less than are not presented

direct sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
direct and indirect sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
we believe the continued increase in the concentration of net revenues to our top customers is a result of the continuing consolidation of companies in our markets 
our net revenues from customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
net revenues by sales channel net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues the increase in oem net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of approximately in scp revenues combined with an increase of approximately in ncp revenues generated through our oems 
the decrease in distribution net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of approximately in ncp net revenues generated through distribution partners 
we believe that our net revenues are driven by product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory our net revenues by geographic territory based on billed to location were as follows net revenues by geographic territory percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage change dollars in thousands asia pacific united states europe  middle east  and africa rest of the world total net revenues we believe the decrease in europe  middle east  africa and rest of the world net revenues and the increase in asia pacific net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our oem customers continuing to migrate production to contract manufacturers located predominantly in asia pacific 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of sales 
our gross profit for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands gross profit percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage points change cost of sales includes the cost of producing  supporting  and managing our supply of quality finished products

approximately million and million of share based compensation expense was included in cost of sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our gross margin percentage for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by the patent litigation settlement expense of approximately million related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july  see note  approximately million of patent litigation damages as a result of the jury s determination rendered on october   and approximately million of sunset period royalty expense related to the july  amended injunction 
during fiscal  we also incurred approximately million of additional expedite and freight charges in connection with our activities to mitigate the impact of the october flooding in thailand that affected one of our contract manufacturers 
the additional expenses in fiscal were partially offset by higher volume and favorable product mix 
we will continue to recognize license fee amortization related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july   over the remaining patent license term and sunset period royalties expense related to the amended injunction during fiscal however  we do not expect to incur any significant costs related to the thailand flood mitigation activities going forward 
we also expect the trend toward increased sales of lower margin products to continue in the future 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development  and support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  and computer service costs related to supporting computer tools used in the design process

approximately million and million of share based compensation expense was included in engineering and development costs for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  with approximately million and million being related to the serverengines acquisition in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
engineering and development headcount increased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal the increase in headcount resulted in a net increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses primarily due to recognizing one full year of salary and related expenses from the serverengines acquisition in fiscal compared to approximately months of salary and related expenses in fiscal the decrease in expenses compared to fiscal was also due to lower non recurring engineering  prototypes  and related costs associated with new product development of approximately million and lower depreciation of approximately million 
as a result of the permanent injunction granted by the court to broadcom on march   which was later amended on july   we expect to incur incremental engineering and development expenses to redesign our impacted products over the next months

as a result  the entire investment of approximately million in the privately held company was impaired 
in addition  the net increase was also due the absence of a one time charge recorded in fiscal for the settlement of our notes receivable from serverengines in connection with the acquisition in august  as required by the authoritative guidance for business combinations of approximately million 
income taxes 
our income tax provision for fiscal and fiscal was as follows in thousands income taxes percentage of net revenues percentage of net revenues increase decrease percentage points change our effective tax expense rate was approximately and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the majority of our earnings were generated from countries other than the us  including india  ireland  and isle of man  where such earnings are generally subject to significantly lower tax rates than the us we expect this trend to continue in the future 
we have made no provision for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the us the decrease in our income tax expense rate was primarily due to a platform contribution transaction entered into by our us and international subsidiaries during fiscal that resulted in incremental us tax expense of approximately million 
in addition  income taxes decreased in fiscal due to a reduction in non deductible stock based compensation expense related to the serverengines acquisition 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded a valuation allowance against certain us federal and state deferred tax assets that impacted tax expense by approximately million and million  respectively  based on our determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents as a result of the global scope of our operations and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  the tax liabilities in each of the countries in which we operate may differ materially from our estimates and impact our expected tax rate in the future

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 

table of contents changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these estimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels using selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  distributors 
these distributors are subject to distribution agreements that may be terminated upon written notice by either party and that generally provide privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard non oem specific products sold to our distributors based on a sell through model 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are generally governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements  and accordingly  we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to our distributors 
we also maintain sales related reserves for our sales incentive programs 
based on the benefit received  we classify the costs of these incentive programs as a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we use a standard cost system to determine cost 
the standard costs are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure that the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions or licensing agreements are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from two to ten years 
furthermore  we assess whether our intangible assets and other long lived assets should be tested for recoverability periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead  is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
the annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter 
we early adopted financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu guidance during the first quarter of fiscal there was no financial statement impact as a result of our early adoption of this guidance 
under asu  we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then 
table of contents performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  otherwise  goodwill is considered impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment under asu and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
we may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for additional information 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the first reporting period that it becomes more likely than not such tax position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not recognition threshold is recorded at the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we record potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded against any deferred tax assets when  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that all of or part of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including recent financial performance  scheduled reversals of temporary differences  projected future taxable income  availability of taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies 
based on a review of such information  we believe that insufficient positive evidence exists to support that we will more likely than not be able to realize the majority of our us federal and state deferred tax assets 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to the extent that they are not expected to be recoverable against taxes previously paid in available carryback periods 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method 
although we grant both unvested stock awards and stock options  the majority of the awards granted and stock based compensation recognized consists of unvested stock awards 
the fair value of each unvested stock award is determined based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date 
for stock options  the fair value of each option is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors including principally stock price volatility and  to a lesser extent  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free interest rate 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
stock based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting tranche of the award 
a forfeiture rate assumption is applied in determining the fair value of our stock based compensation related to both unvested stock awards and stock options based on future expectations and may be revised as significant differences become known 
these adjustments may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 

table of contents litigation costs 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency or litigation settlement when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to litigation settlements with multiple elements are recorded based on the fair value of each element 
legal and other litigation related costs are recognized as the services are provided 
we record insurance and other indemnity recoveries for litigation costs when both of the following conditions are met i the recovery is probable and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
the insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements  however  it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot provide assurance that any actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or substantial settlement charges 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of our existing cash balances and investments  as well as funds expected to be generated from operations 
at july   we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current investments 
at july   we had approximately million in working capital and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and current investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various security holdings  types  and maturities 
we invest in instruments that meet credit quality standards in accordance with our investment guidelines 
we limit our exposure to any one issuer or type of investment with the exception of us government issued or us government sponsored entity securities 
our investments consisted mostly of marketable certificates of deposits and fixed income securities as of july  and we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities 
our cash balances and investments are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
as of july   our international subsidiaries held approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  the majority of which will be used to repay obligations to us affiliate entities that arise in the normal course of business and would not result in additional us tax liabilities upon repatriation 
our accounts receivable are primarily with large multinational oem customers and denominated in us dollars 
as of july   approximately of our accounts receivable are related to customers with a european billing address 
however  we do not believe that the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis will materially impact the collectability of our accounts receivable or adversely affect our financial position or liquidity 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for fiscal years and in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal the current period cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net loss of approximately million before adjustments for amortization of intangible assets of approximately million  share based compensation expense of approximately million  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of approximately million  an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other liabilities of approximately million approximately million of which related to the settlement agreement 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k  and a decrease in prepaid expenses  other assets and prepaid income taxes of approximately million  which was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables  net  of approximately million 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was approximately million compared to cash used of approximately million for fiscal the current period addition to cash was primarily due to maturities of investments that were not reinvested of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of investments of approximately million  and purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
financing activities cash used in financing activities for fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal the current period usage of cash was primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock of approximately million 
prospective capital needs in early august  our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
in april  upon receipt of an unsolicited takeover proposal and related tender offer of broadcom to acquire us  our board of directors elected to temporarily suspend any activity under the share repurchase plan 
in light of broadcom allowing its tender offer to expire on july   emulex s board of directors elected to reactivate the million share repurchase plan effective july  from june  through july   the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million at an average purchase price of per share under this plan 
approximately million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million at an average purchase price of per share were purchased in fiscal our board of directors has not set an expiration date for the plan 
therefore  we may repurchase additional shares under this plan from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
it is expected that any future share repurchases will be financed by available cash and cash from operations 
we plan to continue our strategic investment in research and development  sales and marketing  capital equipment  and facilities 
we may also consider internal and external investment opportunities in order to achieve our growth and market leadership goals  including licensing and joint development agreements with our suppliers  customers  and other third parties 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  current investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and stock repurchasing expenditures for at least the next months 
we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credit or other borrowings 
we have disclosed outstanding legal proceedings in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k  including the consolidated patent infringement lawsuit filed by broadcom against us 
this lawsuit continues to present risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations  including loss of patent rights  monetary damages  and injunction against the sale of accused products 
we continue to present a vigorous post trial defense against this lawsuit  and have appealed the trial verdict 
on july   we entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which both parties agreed to settle and release certain claims related to the patent infringement litigation 
the settlement agreement provided for certain amendments to the april  permanent injunction  and dismissals of certain allegations of the lawsuit  including portions of the scheduled re trial 
we also received a worldwide limited license to the patent  the patent  the patent and 
table of contents related families for certain fields of use including fibre channel applications 
under the term of settlement agreement  we paid to broadcom a lump sum release and license fee of million in cash subsequent to fiscal on july   pursuant to the settlement agreement  the court issued an amended permanent injunction and a stipulation to dismiss certain allegations in the lawsuit in light of the settlement agreement 
at the end of fiscal  we accrued approximately million under the settlement agreement for the fair value of the settlement of claims related to the past sales of products and expensed this to cost of goods sold 
the remaining million was allocated to the fair value of the patent license fees related to the future sales of products which will be recorded as prepaid license fees in the first quarter of fiscal when the payment is made  and amortized to cost of goods sold over the license term in proportion to the estimated future revenues of the licensed technology 
in addition  we expect to incur incremental costs over the next months in the range of million million related to the retrial and to redesign  design around  modify  design  develop  test and requalify certain products that were not covered by the settlement agreement and have previously been found to infringe on the and patents

off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of july   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity in future periods 
the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period total thereafter in thousands leases purchase commitments other commitments total lease payments include common area maintenance cam charges 
purchase commitments represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of july  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
other commitments consist primarily of million related to the settlement agreement entered into with broadcom on july  see note  commitments for software license fees of approximately million and non recurring engineering services of approximately million 

table of contents excludes approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expected timing of payments for the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity we do not believe our cash and cash equivalents are subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of july   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
as of july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities of approximately million 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of july  the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is also limited by the relatively low amount of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect our business in the future
