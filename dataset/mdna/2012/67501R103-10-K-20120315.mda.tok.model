general overview we conduct community banking activities by accepting deposits and making loans in our market area 
our lending products include residential mortgage loans  commercial loans and mortgages  and home equity and other consumer loans 
we also maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities to manage our liquidity and interest rate risk 
our loan and investment portfolios are funded with deposits as well as collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of interest earning assets in our portfolio and changes in levels of interest rates 
the dodd frank act authorizes depository institutions to pay interest on business demand deposits effective july  depending upon competitive responses  that change could have an adverse impact on the bank s interest expense 
growth in net interest income is dependent upon our ability to prudently manage the balance sheet for growth  combined with how successfully we maintain or increase net interest margin  which is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
a secondary source of income is non interest income  or other income  which is revenue that we receive from providing products and services 
the majority of our non interest income generally comes from service charges mostly from service charges on deposit accounts 
we also earn income on bank owned life insurance and receive commissions for various services 
in some years  we recognize income from the sale of securities and real estate owned 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
expenses 
the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist primarily of expenses for salaries and employee benefits and for occupancy and equipment 
we also incur expenses for items such as professional services  advertising  office supplies  insurance  telephone  and postage 
our largest noninterest expense is for salaries and employee benefits  which consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes  and expenses for health insurance  retirement plans and other employee benefits 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  atm and data processing expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes and costs of utilities 
federal deposit insurance corporation assessments are a specified percentage of assessable deposits 
acquisition of cbhc financialcorp  inc on august   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of cbhc  parent company of select bank  in a cash out merger for a total purchase price of million 
select bank has been merged into the bank  with the bank as the surviving entity 
based in egg harbor city  new jersey  cbhc operated five banking offices in atlantic county  new jersey at the date of acquisition 
as a result of the transaction  the company has expanded its service area in atlantic county 
the company expects to reduce costs through consolidation of overlapping offices 
the results of operations acquired in the cbhc transaction have been included in the company s financial results since august  critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of income and expenses 
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions that we use are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are the following loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairment based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
loan impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of collateral or estimated net realizable value 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s evaluation of the estimated losses that have been incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
it is the policy of management to provide for losses on unidentified loans in its portfolio in addition to classified loans 
management monitors its allowance for loan losses monthly and makes adjustments to the allowance through the provision for loan losses as economic conditions and other pertinent factors indicate 
the quarterly review and adjustment of the qualitative factors employed in the allowance methodology and the updating of historic loss experience allow for timely reaction to emerging conditions and trends 
in this context  a series of qualitative factors are used in a methodology as a measurement of how current circumstances are affecting the loan portfolio 
included in these qualitative factors are levels of past due  classified and non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and modifications  nature and volume of loans  changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collections  charge offs and recoveries  and for commercial loans  the level of loans being approved with exceptions to policy  experience  ability and depth of management and staff  national and local economic and business conditions  including various market segments  quality of our loan review system and degree of board oversight  concentrations of credit by industry  geography and collateral type  with a specific emphasis on real estate  and changes in levels of such concentrations  and effect of external factors  including the deterioration of collateral values  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management has established both specific and general pooled allowances 
values assigned to the qualitative factors and those developed from historic loss experience provide a dynamic basis for the calculation of reserve factors for both pass rated loans general pooled allowance and those criticized and classified loans without reserves specific allowance 
the amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan by loan analysis of non performing loans 
loans not individually reviewed are evaluated as a group using reserve factor percentages based on qualitative and quantitative factors described above 
in determining the appropriate level of the general pooled allowance  management makes estimates based on internal risk ratings  which take into account such factors as debt service coverage  loan to value ratios  and external factors 
if a loan is identified as impaired and is collateral dependant  an appraisal is obtained to provide a base line in determining whether the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the net realizable value 
we recognize impairment through a provision estimate or a charge off is recorded when management determines we will not collect of a loan based on foreclosure of the collateral  less cost to sell the property  or the present value of expected cash flows 
as changes in our operating environment occur and as recent loss experience fluctuates  the factors for each category of loan based on type and risk rating will change to reflect current circumstances and the quality of the loan portfolio 
given that the components of the allowance are based partially on historical losses and on risk rating changes in response to recent events  required reserves may trail the emergence of any unforeseen deterioration in credit quality 
other than temporary impairment 
we assess whether a decline is other than temporary with respect to a debt security which has a fair value less than the book value by considering whether we have the intent to sell the security  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery  or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we bifurcate the impact on securities where impairment in value was deemed to be other than temporary between the component representing credit loss and the component representing loss related to other factors  when the security is not otherwise intended to be sold or is required to be sold 
the portion of the fair value decline attributable to credit loss must be recognized through a charge to earnings 
the credit component is determined by comparing the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected  discounted at the rate in effect before recognizing any otti  with the amortized cost basis of the debt security 
we use the cash flow expected to be realized from the security  which includes assumptions about interest rates  timing and severity of defaults  estimates of potential recoveries  the cash flow distribution from the bond indenture and other factors  then apply a discount rate equal to the effective yield of the security 
the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows and the amortized book value is considered a credit loss 
the fair market value of the security is determined using the same expected cash flows  where market based observable inputs are not available  the discount rate is a rate we determine from open market and other sources as appropriate for the security 
the fair value is based on market prices or market based observable inputs when available 
the difference between the fair market value and the credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income 
additional information regarding our accounting for investment securities is included in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc fasb asc  income taxes 
fasb asc requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income as well as judgments about availability of capital gains 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
further  an inability to employ a qualifying tax strategy to utilize our deferred tax asset arising from capital losses may give rise to an additional valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
fasb asc prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
when applicable  we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statement 
assessment of uncertain tax positions under fasb asc requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations 
significant judgment may be involved in applying the requirements of fasb asc our adherence to fasb asc may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates  as fasb asc requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs 
factors that could impact management s judgment include changes in income  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
fair value measurement 
we account for fair value measurement in accordance with fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
fasb asc establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
fasb asc defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  emphasizing that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement 
fasb asc clarifies the application of fair value measurement in a market that is not active 
fasb asc also includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity  affirms the objective of fair value when a market is not active  eliminates the presumption that all transactions are not orderly unless proven otherwise  and requires an entity to disclose inputs and valuation techniques  and changes therein  used to measure fair value 
fasb asc addresses the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
these valuation techniques include the market approach  income approach and cost approach 
the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
the income approach involves converting future amounts to a single present amount 
the measurement is valued based on current market expectations about those future amounts 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset 
fasb asc establishes a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instrument s fair value measurement 
the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
we measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with fasb asc these measurements involve various valuation techniques and models  which involve inputs that are observable  when available  and include the following significant financial instruments investment securities available for sale and derivative financial instruments 
the following is a summary of valuation techniques utilized by us for our significant financial assets and liabilities which are valued on a recurring basis 
investment securities available for sale 
where quoted prices for identical securities are available in an active market  securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
if quoted market prices are not available  then fair values are estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows based on observable market inputs and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation  securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
level market value measurements include an internally developed discounted cash flow model combined with using market data points of similar securities with comparable credit ratings in addition to market yield curves with similar maturities in determining the discount rate 
in addition  significant estimates and unobservable inputs are required in the determination of level market value measurements 
if actual results differ significantly from the estimates and inputs applied  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  that is  the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example  when there is evidence of impairment 
we measure impaired loans  fhlb stock and loans transferred into other real estate owned at fair value on a non recurring basis 
we review and validate the valuation techniques and models utilized for measuring financial assets and liabilities at least quarterly 
goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of companies acquired through business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
core deposit intangibles are a measure of the value of checking  savings and other low cost deposits acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
core deposit intangibles are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the existing deposit relationships acquired  but not exceeding years 
the company evaluates the identifiable intangibles for impairment when an indicator of impairment exists  but not less than annually 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis  but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing 
management performs an annual goodwill impairment test and whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying value

managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
our strategy also emphasizes the origination of one to four family mortgage loans  which typically have lower default rates than other types of loans and are secured by collateral that generally holds its value better than other types of collateral 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
we make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes days past due 
if payment is not then received by the th day of delinquency  additional letters and phone calls generally are made 
generally  when the loan becomes days past due  we send a letter notifying the borrower that we will commence foreclosure proceedings if the loan is not brought current within days 
generally  when the loan becomes days past due  we commence foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any personal property that secures a consumer loan 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
we may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances 
management informs the board of directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than days  all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
when a loan becomes days delinquent  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of its cost  which is the unpaid balance of the loan  plus foreclosure costs  or fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income

federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the office of the comptroller of the currency has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful we establish a specific allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we charge off an amount equal to of the portion of the asset classified loss 
classified assets increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in classified assets reflects the addition of million in commercial mortgage loans  thousand of commercial loans and thousand in consumer loans offset by a decrease of million in residential mortgage loans

at each of the dates in the above table  delinquent mortgage loans consisted primarily of loans secured by residential real estate 
analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of two key elements specific allowances for impaired or collateral dependent loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
see critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total net loans 
the allowance for loan losses decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to the addition to the provision for loan losses of thousand offset by net charge offs of thousand 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses for was primarily to maintain a reserve level deemed appropriate by management in light of factors such as the level of non performing loans  lack of growth in the loan portfolio and the current economic conditions 
at december   the specific allowance on impaired or collateral dependent loans was thousand and the general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio was million 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total net loans

the increase in the provision for loan losses for was primarily to maintain a reserve level deemed appropriate by management in light of factors such as the level of non performing loans  growth in the loan portfolio and the current economic conditions 
at december   the specific allowance on impaired or collateral dependent loans was thousand and the general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio was million

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

in we experienced charge offs of thousand on properties based on current appraisals of non performing properties 
in years prior to  our net charge offs were low  with most charge offs relating to consumer loans 
we believe that our strict underwriting standards and  prior to  a prolonged period of rising real estate values in our market area has been the primary reason for the absence of charged off real estate loans 
interest rate risk management 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
we have adopted an interest rate risk action plan pursuant to which we manage our interest rate risk 
under this plan  we have periodically sold fixed rate mortgage loans  extended the maturities of our borrowings  increased commercial lending  which emphasizes the origination of shorter term  prime based loans  emphasized the generation of core deposits  which provides a more stable  lower cost funding source  and structured our investment portfolio to include more liquid securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of both the board of directors and management  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
net interest income simulation analysis 
we analyze our interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
interest income simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the asset liability committee 
the simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions 
the numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are reviewed by the asset liability committee on a quarterly basis 
changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation 
the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates 
the simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors 
simulation analysis is only an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
we continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
the table below sets forth an approximation of our exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next and month periods using interest income simulation 
the simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income simulation 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
table net interest income simulation at december  percentage change in estimated net interest income over months months basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates n m n m n m not measurable management believes that under the current rate environment  a change of interest rates downward of basis points is not possible as the treasury yield curve is below basis points for maturities of years or less 
therefore  management has deemed a change interest rates downward of basis points not measurable 
this limit will be re evaluated periodically and may be modified as appropriate 
the basis point change in rates in the above table is assumed to occur evenly over the following months 
based on the scenario above  net interest income would be positively within our internal guidelines in the and month periods if rates rose by basis points 
net portfolio value analysis 
in addition to a net interest income simulation analysis  we use an interest rate sensitivity analysis prepared by the office of the comptroller of the currency to review our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or to basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
we measure interest rate risk by modeling the changes in net portfolio value over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the following table  which is based on information that we provide to the office of the comptroller of the currency  presents the change in our net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on office of the comptroller of the currency assumptions  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
table npv analysis net portfolio value dollars in thousands net portfolio value as of portfolio value of assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp the office of the comptroller of the currency uses certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk of savings associations 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
liquidity management 
the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  the purchase of investment securities  deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and operating expenses 
our ability to meet our current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
to meet the needs of clients and manage risk  we engage in liquidity planning and management 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank of new york  which included available overnight lines of credit of million 
on that date  we had no overnight advances outstanding 
at december   we had million in commitments outstanding  which included million in undisbursed construction loans  million in unused home equity lines of credit and million in commercial lines and letters of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered

our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts  federal home loan bank advances and reverse repurchase agreements 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit and commercial banking relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits

capital management 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
under these requirements the federal bank regulatory agencies have established quantitative measures to ensure that minimum thresholds for tier capital  total capital and leverage tier capital divided by average assets ratios are maintained 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on our operations and financial position 
under the capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  ocean city home bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
it is our intention to maintain well capitalized risk based capital levels 
ocean city home bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the federal bank regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
at december   ocean city home bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements and is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december  and  we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
