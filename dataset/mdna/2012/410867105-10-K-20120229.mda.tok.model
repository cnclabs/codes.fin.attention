table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the hanover insurance group  inc and subsidiaries thg  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein 
our results of operations include the accounts of the hanover insurance company hanover insurance and citizens insurance company of america citizens  our principal us domiciled property and casualty companies  chaucer holdings plc chaucer  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
effective july   we acquired chaucer  a specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the society and corporation of lloyd s lloyds and is domiciled in the united kingdom uk 
our results of operations include chaucer s results for the period from july  through december  additionally  our results of operations include our discontinued operations  consisting of our former life insurance and accident and health businesses 
executive overview our business operations consist of four operating segments commercial lines  personal lines  chaucer and other property and casualty 
as further described in note acquisitions and discontinued operations on pages to of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data of this form k  we acquired chaucer on july   which has added meaningful business volumes to the six months ended december  and has affected the comparability of our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
for the year ended december   our discussion of the results of operations reflects chaucer s results only for the period from july  through december   while the commercial lines  personal lines  and other property and casualty segments include results for all of results of operations for the comparable periods in and do not include any results of chaucer 
chaucer s financial results for the six months ended december  will be discussed separately 
our segment income excluding taxes and interest of million in  includes million of segment income generated by chaucer 
our pre tax segment earnings declined in  principally due to an unprecedented level of weather related events that affected the property and casualty industry 
pre tax catastrophe losses were million during  of which million related to our chaucer segment 
during  pre tax catastrophe losses were million 
our catastrophe losses were principally the result of winter storms  tornado  hail and windstorm activity in both the midwest and the northeast in the first half of the year  hurricane irene and floods in thailand and denmark during the second half of a decrease of million in favorable development on prior years loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves  primarily from commercial and personal lines  also contributed to the overall decline in segment results from the prior year 
segment income for our commercial  personal  and other property and casualty lines  excluding catastrophes and development  was million in  compared to million in  reflecting growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio  and what we believe is an improved mix of business  partially offset by increased non catastrophe weather related losses 
commercial lines we believe our small commercial capabilities  distinctiveness in the middle market  and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders 
the small commercial and middle market accounts are expected to significantly contribute to premium growth in commercial lines over the next several years 
we expect to pursue our core strategy of developing deep partnerships with agents  distinctive products  franchise value through limited distribution  and industry segmentation 
growth in our specialty lines continues to be a significant part of our strategy 
the expansion of product offerings in our specialized lines has been supported by several acquisitions over the past several years 
our commercial lines segment net written premium grew by in  with contributions from both our specialty lines and core segments 
our net earned premium increased by in  primarily as a result of fully earning in premiums written previously pursuant to the renewal rights transaction with onebeacon insurance group onebeacon 
we believe these efforts have and will continue to drive improvement in our overall mix of business and ultimately our underwriting profitability 
our losses and loss adjustment expenses were higher in as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the high level of catastrophe losses and  to a lesser extent  non catastrophe weather related losses 
notwithstanding the increase in losses and lae  there was a modest increase in current accident year income primarily due to the growth in earned premium and changes to our mix of business 

table of contents the competitive nature of the commercial lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business only at acceptable margins 
in certain lines of business where a weak economy may be a particularly important factor  such as surety and workers compensation  we endeavor to adjust pricing or take a more conservative approach to risk selection in order to more appropriately reflect the higher risk of loss 
additionally  we are seeking additional rate increases in our property lines as a result of the heightened catastrophe and non catastrophe weather related losses that we experienced in personal lines in our personal lines business  we focus on partnering with high quality  value added agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages 
almost of our policies in force in were account business 
we are focused on making investments that help maintain profitability  build a distinctive position in the market  help diversify us geographically from our historical core states of michigan  massachusetts  new york  and new jersey and provide us with profitable growth opportunities 
written premiums in personal lines in were comparable to underwriting results  excluding catastrophes  improved slightly in  as compared to lower operating expenses in were partially offset by less favorable current accident year results driven by non catastrophe weather related losses 
similar to our strategy in commercial lines  we are seeking additional rate increases in our property lines homeowners coverage as a result of the recent catastrophe and non catastrophe weather related losses that the industry experienced 
in addition  continued increases in premium are expected in our target growth states as we seek to improve profitability and diversify from our existing core states 
chaucer we deploy specialist underwriters in over major insurance and reinsurance classes throughout our diversified portfolio  which includes property  marine and aviation  energy  uk motor and casualty 
we access business through lloyd s  the leading international insurance and reinsurance market  which provides us with access to specialist business in over countries and territories worldwide through its international licenses  brand reputation and strong security rating 
we currently expect underwriting opportunities to increase  and terms and conditions to improve across the majority of international risk classes for our chaucer business in this follows a difficult period for international insurance markets since  with increased frequency and severity of both natural and man made catastrophes worldwide 
we expect to focus more of our capital and underwriting capabilities in those areas where we expect rates to be more favorable  in particular  for catastrophe exposed property  marine and energy risks  and less toward business where rates are currently under pressure  notably casualty and aviation 
we also expect to benefit from continued rate increases in the uk motor market  which comprised approximately of chaucer s net written premium for the six months ended december  we are also seeking opportunities to diversify the business further  including the development of new lines of business  such as international liability  that we expect to meet our return on capital criteria 
overall  we believe that the strength and depth of our underwriting teams  the broad diversity of our underwriting portfolio and our membership in the lloyd s platform  together underpin our ability to manage both the scale and composition of our business 
moreover  these strengths  combined with our continued active management of our portfolio and the opportunities that we expect to arise across the majority of our markets  provide a strong basis for the profitable development of the chaucer business 
description of operating segments our primary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through four operating segments 
these operating segments are commercial lines  personal lines  chaucer and other property and casualty 
commercial lines includes commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  workers compensation and other commercial coverages  such as specialty program business  inland marine  surety and other bonds  professional liability and management liability 
personal lines includes personal automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages 
chaucer includes property  marine and aviation  energy  uk motor  and casualty and other coverages which includes international liability  specialist coverages  and syndicate participations 
the other property and casualty segment consists of opus investment management  inc  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  earnings on holding company assets  and  a voluntary pools business which is in run off 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 

table of contents we report interest expense related to our debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
our debt consists of senior debentures  junior debentures  subordinated notes  advances under our collateralized borrowing program with the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb  and capital securities 
results of operations net income our consolidated net income includes the results of our four operating segments segment income  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis and excluding interest expense on debt 
segment income excludes certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations  such as income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including net gains and losses on certain derivative instruments 
such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  costs to acquire businesses  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe a discussion of segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by segregating income attributable to the core operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business 
management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior year reserve development separate from the other components of earnings 
catastrophes and prior year reserve development are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have affected our results in the past few years 
management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior year reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations 
compared to our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the million decrease is primarily driven by an increase in catastrophe losses and non catastrophe weather related activity  partially offset by income from our chaucer segment 
additionally  in the year ended december   advisory  legal  and accounting costs associated with the acquisition of chaucer and other acquisition expenses totaled million 
we also recorded an million loss in connection with a foreign exchange contract entered into in connection with the acquisition of chaucer  which was partially offset by net foreign exchange gains of million 
compared to our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the million decrease is primarily driven by higher catastrophe losses  which increased million  net of taxes 
results in included a million pre tax gain million  net of taxes associated with a tender offer  whereby we repurchased at a discount a portion of our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities and our senior debentures 
in  we repurchased junior debentures which resulted in a million loss 
in addition  earnings from our discontinued operations decreased by million 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in net realized investment gains  from a gain of million in  to a gain of million in the following table reflects segment income as determined in accordance with gaap and a reconciliation of total segment income to consolidated net income 
for the years ended december in millions segment income loss before income taxes commercial lines personal lines chaucer other property and casualty total interest expense on debt total segment income before income taxes income tax expense on segment income net realized investment gains net gain loss from retirement of debt costs related to acquired businesses loss on derivative instruments net foreign exchange gains income tax benefit expense on non segment items income from continuing operations  net of taxes gain from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income 
table of contents segment results the following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment 
the segment results are presented before interest expense  taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations  including realized gains and losses 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated for the years ended december in millions segment revenues net premiums written net premiums earned net investment income other income total segment revenues losses and operating expenses losses and lae policy acquisition expenses other operating expenses total losses and operating expenses segment income before interest expense and income taxes compared to segment income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
chaucer s results accounted for million of segment income for the year ended december  catastrophe related activity for our commercial and personal lines businesses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million 
excluding the impact of catastrophe related activity  earnings for our commercial and personal lines businesses would have decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily due to higher non catastrophe weather related losses and lae and lower favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio and what we believe is an underlying improvement in our mix of business 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
net premiums written grew by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and net premiums earned grew by million 
chaucer accounted for million of net premiums written and million of net premiums earned for the year ended december  the balance of the growth in net premiums written is attributable to commercial lines 
a significant portion of the increase in net premiums earned in commercial lines is a result of the growth in net premiums written in following the onebeacon renewal rights transaction  as well as growth in our aix program business and in various niche and segmented businesses 
compared to segment income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
catastrophe related activity for our commercial and personal lines businesses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily related to several severe hail  wind and thunderstorm events  particularly in the first half of excluding the impact of catastrophe related activity  segment income would have increased by million 
this increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results with improvements in both commercial and personal lines  partially offset by lower favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  higher expenses and slightly lower net investment income 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million

table of contents compared to commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily driven by growth in our specialty businesses  particularly in our aix program business  which accounted for million of this growth 
also benefiting the overall growth comparison in net premiums written were modest rate increases 
commercial lines underwriting loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase in losses of million 
this was due to higher weather related losses and lae  including catastrophes  and decreased favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  partially offset by growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio 
catastrophe losses for the year ended december  were million  primarily due to hurricane irene during the third quarter  significant tornado  hail and windstorm activity in the second quarter and winter storms in the first quarter  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
included in results was million of favorable lae development  principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated lae reserves 
commercial lines underwriting loss  excluding catastrophe and prior year loss and lae reserve development  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement resulted from growth in earned premium and the resulting positive effect on our expense ratio  and from what we believe to be an improved mix of business 
partially offsetting the effect of this growth were higher non catastrophe weather related losses and lae  and higher losses in our surety business 
the higher level of earned premiums primarily resulted from our onebeacon transaction  from growth in our aix program business  and from other growth initiatives 
our ability to increase commercial lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results may be affected by competition and the current challenging economic environment 
personal lines personal lines net premiums written for the year ended december  was  million  compared to  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the most significant factors contributing to this small decrease were actions we have taken to reduce our market concentration in louisiana  and our continued focus on driving profit improvement in our core states through both rate increases and more selective portfolio management  resulting in lower new business activity 
these decreases were partially offset by higher rates in both our personal automobile and homeowners lines  and by a net premiums written increase of in our target growth states 
continued increases in premium are expected in our target growth states as we seek to improve profitability in those states and diversify from our core states 
net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined  primarily as a result of fewer policies in force in michigan  massachusetts  new york and florida 
we attribute the decrease in policies in force to more selective portfolio management  and to rate increases we have implemented despite the competitive pricing environment 
net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased  resulting primarily from rate increases 
personal lines underwriting loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to a profit of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease is due to higher weather related losses and lae  including catastrophes  and to decreased favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  partially offset by lower operating expenses 
catastrophe losses were million for the year ended december   including significant winter storms  tornado  hail and windstorm activity in the first half of the year and hurricane irene during the third quarter  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
included in results was million of favorable lae development  principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated lae reserves 
personal lines underwriting profit  excluding prior year loss and lae reserve development and catastrophes  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in non catastrophe current accident year results was primarily due to lower operating expenses and what we believe is an improved mix of business  partially offset by non catastrophe weather related losses 
although we have been able to obtain rate increases in our personal lines markets  our ability to maintain and increase personal lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results could be affected by price competition  regulatory and legal developments and the current challenging economic conditions  particularly 
table of contents in michigan  which is our largest state 
our rate actions have adversely affected our ability to increase our policies in force and new business  particularly in our core states and in florida 
there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of production or maintain or increase rates in light of the highly competitive environment 
we may also implement various rate  underwriting  and other actions to create capacity for growing partner agent account business  reduce our property concentrations  and with a view to increasing our longer term profitability 
such events may affect our ability to grow 
chaucer chaucer s net premiums written was million for the six months ended december  by line of business  chaucer s net premiums written were comprised of uk motor  marine and aviation  property  energy and casualty and other lines 
this business mix reflects our specialist underwriting strategy and active management of our portfolio 
chaucer s underwriting profit for the six months ended december  was million 
catastrophe losses for the six months ended december  were million  principally due to floods in thailand and denmark 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves for the six months ended december  was million 
chaucer s underwriting profit  excluding prior year loss and lae development and catastrophes  was million in the six months ended december  underwriting expenses of million represented of earned premium 
we currently expect to achieve rate increases for a majority of chaucer lines in recent natural catastrophe losses  particularly those affecting the us  new zealand  japan and thailand  are triggering rate increases in the majority of catastrophe exposed territories 
we also expect to see terms and conditions improve in our energy portfolio as markets respond to losses in we expect our casualty and aviation accounts to remain challenging  with over capacity affecting pricing 
in our uk motor account  which has experienced significant price increases since  we expect more modest rate increases in  although we anticipate these will exceed claims inflation 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or increase our rates in light of economic and regulatory conditions in our markets 
other property and casualty other property and casualty segment loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to a profit of million for the year ended december  the million decrease is primarily due to lower net investment income and less favorable development in our run off voluntary pools 
compared to commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily driven by increased premiums associated with the onebeacon renewal rights transaction of million  and growth in our managed program business through aix  which accounted for million  as well as growth in various niche and segmented businesses 
also benefiting the overall growth comparison in net premiums written was a slight improvement in rate 
commercial lines underwriting loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to a profit of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in favorable prior year loss and lae reserve development  increased catastrophe losses resulting from several severe hail  wind and thunderstorm events  and to higher expenses  partially offset by more favorable current accident year loss results 
catastrophe losses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily in our commercial multiple peril line 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change was primarily related to our surety bonds  workers compensation  and commercial multiple peril lines 
included in the current year results was million of favorable lae development  principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated lae reserves 
lae in includes a benefit of million  including million associated with prior accident years  related to a change in our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology 
commercial lines underwriting loss  excluding prior year loss and lae reserve development and catastrophes  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in losses was primarily due to increased operating expenses  principally attributable to costs associated with our westward expansion initiative  increased variable compensation  and increased costs in our specialty business 
these factors were partially offset by more favorable current accident year loss results  primarily in our surety bond and commercial multiple peril businesses 

table of contents personal lines personal lines net premiums written for the year ended december  was  million  compared to  million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the most significant factor contributing to lower net premiums written is our continued focus on driving profit improvement in our core states  resulting in lower new business activity 
policies in force in our core states decreased in this was largely offset by our efforts to diversify our personal lines business into targeted growth states 
policies in force in our target growth states increased in net premiums written in the personal automobile line of business declined  primarily as a result of lower policies in force in michigan  massachusetts  florida and new york  which we attribute to our efforts to improve or maintain margins in those states and the competitive pricing environment 
net premiums written in the homeowners line of business increased  resulting primarily from rate actions in policies in force in the homeowners line increased in our targeted growth states  primarily from our account rounding initiatives 
personal lines underwriting profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results  principally resulting from benign loss trends  which we attribute to improved non catastrophe weather  and improvement in our mix of business  shifting to a greater proportion of whole account business  continued rate increases in both personal automobile and homeowners lines  and to lower expenses 
these were partially offset by increased catastrophe losses due to several severe hail  wind  and thunderstorm events 
catastrophe losses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
included in the current year results was million of favorable lae development  principally related to a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
lae in included a benefit of million  including million associated with prior accident years  related to a change in our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology 
personal lines underwriting profit  excluding prior year loss and lae reserve development and catastrophes  was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year loss results  principally resulting from lower frequency of losses  which we attribute to improved non catastrophe weather and benign loss trends 
additionally  we experienced an improvement in our mix of business  shifting to a greater proportion of whole account business  as well as continued rate increases in both the personal automobile and homeowners lines 
also  underwriting and other operating expenses decreased  primarily due to lower pension costs  the favorable resolution of a loss contingency and to lower technology costs 
other property and casualty other property and casualty segment income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease is primarily due to lower favorable development in our run off voluntary pools  partially offset by lower pension costs in reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses our loss reserves with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  taking into account past loss experience  modified for current trends  as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
loss reserves represent our largest liability 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date 
they also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
case reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy 
for some classes of business  average case reserves are used initially 
case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim 
ibnr reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves 
the sum of the case reserves and the ibnr reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 

table of contents we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques 
we update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available 
net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed 
ibnr reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred or are expected to occur in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which may not yet be known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
ibnr represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes 
in fact  approximately of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses and loss expenses 
management s process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization  including finance  actuarial  claims  legal  underwriting  distribution and business operations management 
the process incorporates facts currently known and the present  and in some cases  the anticipated  state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information  and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
critical judgments and key assumptions we determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic and other information 
the estimation process is a combination of objective and subjective information  the blending of which requires significant professional judgment 
there are various assumptions required  including future trends in frequency and severity of claims  operational changes in claim handling  and trends related to general economic and social conditions 
informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process 
given the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses will vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations 
there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving 
there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us  particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines  by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business  such as the program business written by our aix subsidiary  chaucer s international liability lines  our new professional liability specialty lines  and business written in the western part of the united states 
in some of these cases  there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely 
a combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods  provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves 
historically  we have limited the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical professional liability 
with the acquisition of hanover professionals in  which writes lawyers professional e o coverage  the acquisition of campania in  which writes medical professional liability and product liability coverages  and the introduction of new specialty coverages  such as our other professional management liability products  we are increasing  and expect to continue to increase  our exposure to longer tailed liability lines  including d o coverages 
the chaucer business acquired this year contains several international and us liability lines  of which financial institution and professional liability  international liability and energy liability  contribute the most uncertainty 

table of contents we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred 
when these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years  they are described separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
as discussed below  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
however  we have experienced unfavorable development in prior years and there can be no absolute assurance that current loss and lae reserves will be sufficient 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the nature of policies written by us  and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on segment income  based on full year premiums 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors affect multiple lines of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
additionally  there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses  with respect to which we have less familiarity and  in some cases  limited historical claims experience 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs 
for example  we have experienced increasing medical and attendant care costs  including those associated with automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
also  the uk motor business written by chaucer recently has experienced high levels of claims inflation and increases in potential fraud type claims 
these increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we are also defendants in various litigation matters  including putative class actions  which may claim punitive damages  bad faith or extra contractual damages  legal fees and interest  or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation 
resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards 
loss and lae reserves by line of business reserving process overview our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount is likely to vary from our original estimate 
short tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage  homeowners property  commercial property and marine business 
the chaucer business  while having 
table of contents a longer tail on average than the our traditional us business  contains a substantial book of uk motor property damage  worldwide property insurance and reinsurance business  including certain high excess property layers  marine property  aviation property and energy property business which has relatively short development patterns 
for these property coverages  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs and property losses are often more easily valued 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex 
however  this is less true for our chaucer reinsurance business and high excess property layers where there is often a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date the claim is reported compared with our direct insurance operations 
therefore  the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for our assumed reinsurance and high excess property layers than for our direct insurance lines 
while we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter tailed classes of business  most of our loss reserves relate to longer tail liability classes of business 
long tailed classes include commercial liability  automobile liability  workers compensation and other types of third party coverage 
chaucer business longer tailed lines include aviation liability  marine liability  energy liability  nuclear liability  uk motor medical and liability  international liability  specialist liability  and financial institutions and professional liability 
for many liability claims  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for long tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations  the legal environment and the risk and expense of protracted litigation 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability compared to short tail coverages 
most of our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools is long tailed casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us  and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager 
a comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly  generally quarterly 
this review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims 
where appropriate  the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of this process  we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience  trends and other relevant factors 
within the comprehensive loss reserving process  standard actuarial methods which include loss development factor methods  expected loss methods bornheutter ferguson  and adjusted loss methods berquist sherman  are given due consideration 
these methods are described below loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
bornheutter ferguson methods utilize the product of the expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid to calculate ibnr directly 
the expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years  adjusted to reflect expected earned premium  current rating  claims cost levels and changes in business mix 
the expected losses  and corresponding loss ratios  are a critical component of bornheutter ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide 
berquist sherman methods are used for estimating reserves in business lines where historical development patterns may be deemed less reliable for more recent accident years ultimate losses 
under these methods  patterns of historical paid or reported losses are first adjusted to reflect current payment settlement patterns and case reserve adequacy and then evaluated in the same manner as the loss development factor methods described above 
the reported loss development factor method can be less appropriate when the adequacy of case reserves suddenly changes  while the paid loss development factor method can likewise be less appropriate when settlement patterns suddenly change 

table of contents in addition to the methods described above  various tailored reserving methodologies are used for certain businesses 
for example  for some low volume and high volatility classes of business  special reserving techniques are utilized that estimate ibnr by selecting the loss ratio that balances actual reported losses to expected reported losses as defined by the estimated underlying reporting pattern 
also  for some classes with long exposure periods eg energy construction  engineering and political risks  earnings patterns plus an estimated reporting lag applied to the bornheutter ferguson initial expected loss ratio are used to estimate ibnr 
this is done in order to reflect the changing average exposure periods by policy year and consequently accident year 
in completing the loss reserve analysis  a variety of assumptions must be made for each line of business  coverage and accident year 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods  when applied to a particular class of business  can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by line of business and coverage  and by accident year based on an evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries  and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect ultimate losses 
for most classes of shorter tailed business in our commercial and personal lines segments  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a relatively stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally appropriate 
for many of the classes of shorter tailed business in our chaucer segment  the emergence of paid and incurred losses may exhibit a relatively volatile pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
in certain cases where there is a relatively low level of reliability placed on the available paid and incurred loss data  expected loss methods or adjusted loss methods are considered appropriate for the most recent accident year 
for longer tailed lines of business  applying the loss development factor method often requires even more judgment in selecting development factors  as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tailed lines of business with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg  personal automobile liability  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  even in the most recent accident years  but expected loss methods and adjusted loss methods are always considered and frequently utilized in the selection process 
for those long tailed lines of business with low frequency and high loss potential eg  commercial liability  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
in these situations  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the loss reserve estimates for these accident years are based on methods less reliant on extrapolation  such as bornheutter ferguson 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods or adjusted loss methods are given increasing weight 
management endeavors to apply as much available data as practicable to estimate the loss reserve amount for each line of business  coverage and accident year  utilizing varying assumptions  projections and methods 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this loss reserve estimated amount 
our carried reserves for each line of business and coverage are determined based on this quarterly loss reserving process 
in making the determination  we consider numerous quantitative and qualitative factors 
quantitative factors include changes in reserve estimates in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past  the level of volatility within a particular class of business  the estimated effects of reinsurance  including reinstatement premiums  general economic trends  and other factors 
qualitative factors may include legal and regulatory developments  changes in claim handling  recent entry into new markets or products  changes in underwriting practices  concerns that we do not have sufficient or quality historical reported and paid loss and lae information with respect to a particular line or segment of our business  effects of the economy and political outlook  perceived anomalies in the historical results  evolving trends or other factors 
in doing so  we must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
even if a change is determined to be apparent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be partially or fully reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to reserves for more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 

table of contents reserving process uncertainties as stated above  numerous factors both internal and external contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves  including changes in the rate of inflation for goods and services related to insured damages eg  medical care  home repairs  etc  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions  changes in the general attitude of juries in determining damage awards  legislative actions  changes in the extent of insured injuries  changes in the trend of expected frequency and or severity of claims  changes in our book of business eg  change in mix due to new product offerings  new geographic areas  etc  changes in our underwriting practices  and changes in claim handling procedures and or systems 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial  social conditions  political risks  and economic conditions change 
for example  claims which we consider closed may be re opened as additional damages surface or new liability theories are presented 
these and other issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
as a result  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience further complicate the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we consider the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  reporting lags  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a line of business and coverage 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each line of business and coverage  we regularly adjust the assumptions and methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience  as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in longer tailed classes of business and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions  the cost of litigation or determining liability and the ultimate loss  inflation and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the chaucer segment contains run off business comprised of liability lines  notably financial institutions and professional liability business written by lloyd s syndicate there is particular uncertainty around the reserve estimates in respect of business written in and which have been subject to claims arising out of the financial turmoil in that time period  particularly in the financial institutions book 
these claims are unlikely to be settled for some time since they contain numerous coverage issues and in many cases involve class action lawsuits that are likely to take several years to resolve 
we have utilized substantially all of our available reinsurance with respect to losses and lae related to syndicate business written in the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is impossible to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tailed classes of business and classes of business that are more vulnerable to economic or political risks 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate  and as a result  we do not establish reserve range estimates 

table of contents reserving process for catastrophe events the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and ibnr  primarily for damage to property 
in general  our estimates for catastrophe reserves are determined on an event basis by considering various sources of available information  including specific loss estimates reported to us based on claim adjuster inspections  overall industry loss estimates  and our internal data regarding exposures related to the geographical location of the event 
however  depending on the nature of the catastrophe  the estimation process can be further complicated by other impediments 
for example  for hurricanes  complications often include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses  delays in the ability of claims adjusting staff to inspect losses  difficulties in determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain or are specifically excluded from coverage caused by flood  and challenges in estimating additional living expenses  assessing the impact of demand surge  exposure to mold damage  and the effects of numerous other considerations 
estimates for catastrophes which occur at or near the end of a financial reporting period may be even less reliable since we will have less claims data available and little time to complete our estimation process 
in such situations  we may adapt our practices to accommodate the circumstances 
for events designated as catastrophes which affect our commercial and personal lines business segments  we generally calculate ibnr reserves directly as a result of an estimated ibnr claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event 
such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event  of policyholder exposures within the affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence 
depending on the nature of the event  available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims associates within the affected geographic area  feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area  as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date 
in addition  loss emergence from similar historical events is compared to the estimated ibnr for our current catastrophe events to help assess the reasonableness of our estimates 
for events designated as catastrophes which affect our chaucer business segment  we initially calculate ibnr reserves using a ground up exposure by exposure analysis based on each cedant or insured 
these are supported by broker supplied information  catastrophe modeling and industry event estimates 
as more specific claim level data becomes available over time for each catastrophe event  these initial estimates are revised and updated by claim frequency and severity modeling as described above  as appropriate for each event 
reserving sensitivity analysis the following discussion presents disclosure related to possible variation in reserve estimates due to changes in key assumptions 
this information is provided for illustrative purposes only 
many other assumptions may also lead to material reserve adjustments 
if any such variations do occur  they would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore their impact on our results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variations greater than the amounts described below and for any such variations to be recognized in a single quarterly or annual period 
no consideration has been given to potential correlation or lack of correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business and coverage as described below 
as a result and because there are so many other factors which affect our reserve estimate  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts described below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility in total 
while we believe these are reasonably likely scenarios  the reader should not consider the following sensitivity analysis as illustrative of a reserve range 
personal and commercial automobile bodily injury reserves recorded for bodily injury on voluntary business were million as of december  a key assumption for bodily injury is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve 
a change in the imbedded inflation would have changed estimated ibnr by approximately million  either positive or negative  respectively  at december  workers compensation reserves recorded for workers compensation on voluntary business were million as of december  a key assumption for workers compensation is the inflation rate underlying the estimated reserve 
given the long reporting pattern for this line of business  an additional key assumption is the amount of additional development required to reach full maturity  thereby reflecting ultimate costs  as represented by the tail factor 
a change in the imbedded inflation and a one point change to the tail factor assumption eg changed to or would have changed estimated ibnr by approximately million  either positive or negative  at december  
table of contents monoline and multi peril general liability reserves recorded for general liability on voluntary business were million as of december  a key assumption for general liability is the implied adequacy of the underlying case reserves

these amounts for include favorable loss and lae reserve development of million and million  for the full year for commercial lines and personal lines  respectively  and million for chaucer for the six months ended december  the primary drivers of reserve development for the year ended december  were as follows lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line  primarily related to bodily injury coverage in the through accident years 
lower than expected losses within our commercial multiple peril line related to the through accident years 
lower than expected losses within our workers compensation line related to the through accident years 
lower than expected losses in chaucer s energy  property and uk motor lines  primarily related to the and accident years 
additionally  within other commercial lines  unfavorable development in our professional liability and surety lines were partially offset by favorable development in our healthcare and other commercial property lines 
the primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended december  were as follows lower than expected losses within our personal automobile line across all coverages  primarily related to the accident year 
lower than expected losses within the workers compensation line  primarily related to the and accident years 
lower than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line in liability coverages  primarily related to the through accident years 
within our other commercial lines  our commercial umbrella line related to the through accident years contributed to the favorable development  partially offset by unfavorable development in our surety line  primarily related to the accident year 
in addition  the amount includes million of favorable development resulting from a change in the cost factors used for establishing unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves 
the primary drivers for reserve development during the year ended december  were as follows lower than expected losses within the personal automobile line  primarily related to bodily injury coverage in the through accident years 
lower than expected losses within the workers compensation line  primarily in the through accident years 
lower than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line  primarily in the through accident years 
lower than expected losses within the surety line  lower projected losses in our run off voluntary pools and lower projected exposures to asbestos and environmental liability for our direct written business 
partially offsetting the favorable development was unfavorable non catastrophe weather related property loss development  primarily related to our homeowners  commercial property and personal automobile physical damage lines 
in addition  in  we changed our unallocated loss adjustment expense reserving methodology from that based on cash payments to that based on unit costs  which resulted in a million benefit  of which million related to prior years 
we believe that the methodology based on unit costs is more representative of our future costs of settling our existing claims 
asbestos and environmental reserves although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos and environmental damage liability through specific policy exclusions  we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures 
ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos and environmental damage liability were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million for and million for both and during  there was minimal activity for our asbestos and environmental 
table of contents reserves  resulting in a decrease of million 
during  we reduced our asbestos and environmental reserves by million due to several small settlements 
in recent years  average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly 
as a result of the declining payments  our estimate of asbestos and environmental liability reserves was lowered  resulting in favorable reserve development of million during the year ended december  as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos and environmental damage liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  we have established gross loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos and environmental damage liability of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
results of operations from these pools are included in our other property and casualty segment 
the million decrease in these reserves during was primarily due to a large claim settlement within these pools 
a significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in run off 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately million annually over the past ten years 
during the year ended december   our ecra pool reserves were lowered by million as the result of an actuarial study completed by the ecra pool manager 
we reviewed the ecra actuarial study  concurred that the study was reasonable  and adopted its estimate 
in addition  we recorded additional favorable development of million in the same year on a separate large claim settlement within these pools 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 
we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability claims  whether resulting from direct business  assumed reinsurance or pool business  based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
nevertheless  the asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised  and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position 
reinsurance we maintain a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
we utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses  stabilize earnings and protect capital resources  including facultative reinsurance  excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured  exposure analyses prepared by consultants  our capital allocation models and on market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms and conditions with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements  reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies  and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us  as the ceding insurer  from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow  ice storm  windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
although we believe our catastrophe reinsurance program  including our retention and co participation amounts for and  are appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment  there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during additionally  as a result of the current economic environment  as well as  losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years  the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods 
we may not be able to pass these costs on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums or assessments

table of contents european sovereign and non sovereign debt exposure our european fixed maturity credit exposure at december  was as follows non sovereign in millions sovereign foreign agency financial non financial total country amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value united kingdom germany france spain switzerland netherlands supranationals sweden italy norway ireland luxembourg belgium portugal denmark total fixed maturities our sovereign debt totals million  or of the total portfolio  and is limited to the highly rated countries of the uk  germany  france and denmark 
we have no sovereign debt of lower rated countries such as greece  portugal  ireland  italy and spain 
our supranational and foreign agency exposure totals million  or of the total portfolio  and primarily consists of debt securities from the highly rated countries of germany  netherlands and norway 
exposure to european banks  excluding those that are based in the uk  totals million  or of investment assets 
also  we hold money market funds totaling million  or of the total portfolio  which are comprised of a well diversified portfolio of short term debt securities of predominately large financial institutions domiciled in highly rated countries 
the remainder of our european non sovereign debt exposure  excluding the uk  is million  which represents of the portfolio 
generally  these securities are high quality  large cap multi national companies that are well diversified by sector  country and issuer 
the table above represents all european countries in which we have exposure 
we determined country exposures based on the country of domicile for the ultimate parent company of the various issuers we hold  however  in light of the economic and financial inter relatedness and dependencies that exist among european countries and related financial systems  economic turmoil in one country could trigger a contagion effect on other countries 
we believe the quality of our european credit exposure remains sound based on ratings and issuer strength  position in the capital structure  support through guarantees and partial government ownership by highly rated countries  diversity and quality of non financial issuers and blend of industry exposures  and yield curve position 
we believe that we do not have meaningful indirect exposures in our portfolio or invest in credit derivatives 
we manage our country exposure using fundamental analysis coupled with relative value considerations 
investment decisions are based on the combination of a top down macroeconomic perspective and bottom up credit security analysis 
we monitor political and economic developments  progress toward attainment of growth and budget targets  developments related to policy  reform and regulatory initiatives from european officials  progress toward funding objectives  including the availability and cost of funding  outlook for credit ratings  ability of banks to meet increased regulatory capital standards  operate in a weakened macroeconomic environment  and maintain adequate liquidity and sufficient access to capital to meet funding requirements  and contagion throughout the financial system as evidenced by increased costs for interbank funding  lower prices for stocks and corporate bonds  as well as the availability of capital 

table of contents we actively manage our current holdings and seek securities with the best combination of credit strength and valuation 
as we invest new capital  we have a defensive bias based on the uncertainty regarding the strength and duration of economic recovery  downside risks as a result of the european debt crisis and our belief that volatility will remain high based on these challenges 
accordingly  some areas of our focus include providers of essential services or products best positioned to navigate the period of weak growth  industrials with greater international exposure  either locally or via exports  particularly to the developing world  which we view more favorably based on higher growth assumptions for emerging market economies  and financial institutions best positioned regarding asset quality  liquidity and capital adequacy 
overall economic growth remains weak throughout the european region and is expected to have a dampening effect on earnings growth and credit quality for some time 
volatility remains high and european sovereign risk premiums are elevated  although down from peak levels 
many attribute the decline in risk premiums to the apparent success of the european central bank s long term refinancing operations ltro since it created enough demand to lower short term government bond yields in ltro is designed to support banks by reducing systemic risk and thereby bank and sovereign funding 
also in  several sovereign debt ratings were downgraded by standard poor s and fitch  which had limited impact on sovereign yields since the bulk of these actions were anticipated by investors 
moody s is assessing all european bank ratings in light of the challenges they face as a result of the crisis and expects negative rating actions on the banks most affected by the crisis  with many bank ratings likely to be placed on review for downgrade during the first quarter we do not anticipate that any such developments will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
other than temporary impairments for the year ended december   we recognized in earnings million of other than temporary impairments otti on fixed maturity and equity securities 
otti on debt securities was million  primarily on below investment grade corporate and municipal bonds that we intend to sell 
additionally  we recognized otti of million related to estimated credit losses on residential mortgage backed securities 
we also recognized otti on a common stock of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of otti on fixed maturities  certain low income housing tax credit limited partnerships lihtc and equity securities in earnings  of which million related to lihtc partnerships  million was estimated credit losses on debt securities  million related to debt securities classified as intend to sell and million related to common stocks 
for the year ended december   we recognized otti of million in earnings  which principally included losses on below investment grade corporate bonds in the industrial sector we intended to sell of million and million from perpetual preferred securities  primarily in the financial sector 
unrealized losses the following table provides information about our fixed maturities and equity securities that are in an unrealized loss position

december in millions gross unrealized losses fair value gross unrealized losses fair value fixed maturities investment grade months or less greater than months total investment grade fixed maturities below investment grade months or less greater than months total below investment grade fixed maturities equity securities months or less total 
table of contents gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities decreased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in unrealized losses was primarily attributable to lower interest rates  partially offset by greater equity losses and widening of credit spreads across all sectors 
at december   gross unrealized losses consist primarily of million of corporate fixed maturities  million of mortgage backed securities  million of equity securities  and million in municipal securities 
we view the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term  allowing us to realize their anticipated long term economic value 
with respect to gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities  we do not intend to sell  nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell  such debt securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost see also liquidity and capital resources on pages to of this form k with respect to equity securities  we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  the global economic recovery is less robust than we expect or reverts to recessionary trends  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  an otti would be recognized as a realized loss 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations  with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
december in millions due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years mortgage backed and asset backed securities total fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities the carrying values of defaulted fixed maturity securities on non accrual status at december  and were not material 
the effects of non accruals compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities  were reductions in net investment income of million for both years ended december  and any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income 
our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be significantly impacted by changes in market values of our securities 
as the us and global financial markets and economies remain unstable  market volatility could increase and defaults on fixed income securities could occur 
as a result  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and or financial position 
fiscal and monetary policies in place  primarily in the united states and europe  are supportive of moderate economic growth 
the removal or modification of these policies could have an adverse effect on issuers level of business activity or liquidity  increasing the probability of future defaults 
while we may experience defaults on fixed income securities  particularly with respect to non investment grade securities  it is difficult to foresee which issuers  industries or markets will be affected 
as a result  the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods 

table of contents derivative instruments we maintain an overall risk management strategy that can incorporate the use of derivative instruments to manage significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by foreign currency and interest rate volatility 
in april  we entered into a foreign currency forward contract to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk embedded in the purchase price of chaucer  which was denominated in uk pound sterling gbp 
this contract had a notional amount of million and was settled on july  for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of million in income from continuing operations 
the loss on the contract was due to a decrease in the exchange rate between the gbp and the us dollar  but was more than offset by the lower us dollars required to meet the gbp based purchase price 
since a foreign currency hedge in which the hedged item is a forecasted transaction relating to a business combination does not qualify for hedge accounting under asc  derivatives and hedging asc  we did not apply hedge accounting to this transaction 
see note acquisitions and discontinued operations on pages to of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data of this form k for additional information 
in may  we entered into a treasury lock forward agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our planned issuance of senior debt  which was completed on june  this hedge qualified as a cash flow hedge under asc it matured in june and resulted in a loss of million  which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized in earnings over the term of the senior notes 
additionally  chaucer held foreign currency forward contracts utilized to mitigate changes in fair value caused by foreign currency fluctuation in converting the fair value of gbp and euro denominated investment portfolios into their us dollar denominated equivalent 
these portfolios supported us dollar denominated claim reserve liabilities 
we recognized a gain of million related to these instruments

the loss on the contract was offset by the lower us dollars required to meet the gbp based purchase price  which resulted in a million gain on foreign exchange 
additional decreases in the exchange rate occurred subsequent to payment of cash proceeds on july  gains of million were recognized related to the loan notes that are due in gbp to certain former shareholders of chaucer common stock for the year ended december  we will be subject to fluctuations in the currency until such loan notes have been paid 
discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of i discontinued first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic business  including both the loss associated with the sale of faflic on january  and the loss or income resulting from its prior business operations  ii discontinued operations of our variable life insurance and annuity business in  and iii discontinued accident and health business 
discontinued faflic and variable life insurance and annuity business on january   we sold our remaining life insurance subsidiary  faflic  to commonwealth annuity and life insurance company commonwealth annuity  a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc  goldman sachs 
previously  on december   we sold our variable life insurance and annuity business to goldman sachs  including the reinsurance of of the variable business of faflic 
we agreed to indemnify commonwealth annuity and goldman sachs for certain litigation  regulatory matters and other liabilities relating to the pre closing activities of the businesses that were sold 
as of december   our total gross liability related to these guarantees was million 
we regularly review and update this liability for legal and regulatory matter indemnities 
although we believe our current estimate for this liability is appropriate  there can be no assurance that these estimates will not materially increase in the future 
adjustments to this reserve are recorded in our results in the period in which they are determined 

table of contents in  and  we recognized a gain of million  million and million  respectively  related to the sale of faflic and the variable life insurance and annuity business 
these gains were primarily due to reductions in the estimate of indemnification liabilities related to the sales 
gains in also included million related to a settlement with the internal revenue service irs related to tax years and and other tax related items

discontinued accident and health insurance business the discontinued accident and health business had no significant financial results that impacted or the loss of million in was primarily from net realized investment losses resulting from other than temporary impairments 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio 
in a rising interest rate environment  the value of the fixed income sector  which comprises of our investment portfolio  may decline as a result of decreases in the fair value of the securities 
our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par 
however  our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets  our analysis of an issuer s credit metrics and prospects  or as a result of changes in cash flow needs 
interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result  profitability 
the portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates 
the resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields 
in a rising interest rate environment  the funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates 
the following table illustrates the estimated impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  of hypothetical changes in prevailing interest rates  defined as changes in interest rates on us treasury debt 
it does not reflect changes in credit spreads  liquidity spreads and other factors that affect the value of securities 
since changes in prevailing interest rates are often accompanied by changes in these other factors  the reader should not assume that an actual change in interest rates would result in the values illustrated 
dollars in millions investment type bp bp bp bp bp bp residential mortgage backed securities all other fixed income securities total our overall investment strategy is intended to balance investment income with credit and duration risk while maintaining sufficient liquidity and the opportunity for capital growth 
the asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes 
we look to balance the goals of capital preservation  net investment income stability  liquidity and total return 
the majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets 
through fundamental research and credit analysis  our investment professionals seek to identify a portfolio of stable income producing higher quality us government  foreign government  municipal  corporate  residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  as well as undervalued securities in the credit markets balanced by strong relative value characteristics 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industrial sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors and  in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry debt which is subject to interest rate risk  which was issued at fixed interest rates between and 
current market conditions do not allow for us to invest assets at similar rates of return  therefore  our earnings on a similar level of assets are not sufficient to cover our current debt interest costs 
the following tables for the years ended december  and provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturities 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity 
available for sale securities include both us and foreign denominated fixed maturities 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
specifically  variable rate available for sale securities comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted average interest rates 
therefore  the variable rate investments are not presented separately  instead they are included in the tables at their current interest rate 
debt is presented at contractual maturities  except for the debt for previously acquired subsidiaries 
we have presented this debt in the category that reflects the more likely payments  which is expected to be earlier than their contractual maturities

portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and price risk is actively managed through a variety of techniques 
at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the market price of our equity securities would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of approximately million 
a hypothetical increase or decrease at december  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of million 
foreign currency exchange risk our chaucer segment has exposure to foreign currency risk  most notably in its insurance contracts and its invested assets 
some of its insurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss 
foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed 
thus  our chaucer segment attempts to manage its foreign currency risk by seeking to match its liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
we may also utilize foreign currency forward contracts as part of our investment strategy 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the uk pound sterling and the canadian dollar 
a hypothetical 
table of contents reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately million at december  in  we did not have material exposure to foreign currency related risk 
income taxes we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us and foreign countries in which we operate 
we file a consolidated us federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its us subsidiaries 
generally  taxes are accrued at the us statutory tax rate of for income from the us operations 
our primary us jurisdiction is the uk with a rate 
the uk statutory rate decreases from to effective april  we accrue taxes on certain non us income  which is subject to non us tax as a result of being owned by a us shareholder at the us rate 
foreign tax credits  where available  are utilized to offset us tax as permitted 
certain of our non us income is not subject to non us tax until repatriated 
foreign taxes on this non us income are accrued at the local foreign rate and do not have an accrual for us deferred taxes since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested overseas 
the benefit for income taxes from continuing operations was million in and the provision for income taxes from continuing operations were million and million in and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of   and on pre tax income for   and  respectively 
these provisions reflect the decreases in our valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in addition  the and provisions reflect benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of million and million  respectively 
absent these benefits  the provision for income taxes for   and would have been million or  million or  and million or  respectively 
our income tax expense on segment income was million for  compared to million for and million in the decreases in and are primarily due to lower segment income 
included in our deferred tax net asset as of december  is an asset of million related to us capital loss carryforwards 
our pre tax capital losses carried forward are million  including million resulting from the sale of faflic in at december   we have a full valuation allowance against this asset  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
in addition  at december   we have a deferred tax asset of million related to us net operating loss carryforwards and we have a deferred tax asset of million related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
our pre tax us operating loss carryforward of will expire beginning in our pre tax foreign operating loss carryforwards of million were generated in the uk and have no expiration date 
it is our opinion that there will be sufficient future us and us taxable income to utilize these loss carryforwards 
our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of loss carryforwards may change over time 
as of december   we have a deferred tax asset of million of alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards 
we expect to utilize these tax credits during the next four to five years 
the result of their utilization will be a lower current tax rate offset by a higher deferred tax provision  and also lower cash expenditures for federal income taxes during the utilization period 
once the minimum tax credits have been fully utilized  we expect our current tax rate to be closer to the statutory rate of 
although there is no expiration on amt credit carryforwards  we cannot be certain that we will utilize them as quickly as our expectations 
in september  we completed a transaction which resulted in the realization  for tax purposes only  of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of million 
this transaction enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset this gain  and resulted in the release of million of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards 
a release of million was reflected in income from continuing operations and the remaining amount of million was reflected as a benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this amount will be released into income from continuing operations  related to non segment income  in future years  as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature 
during  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by million  from million to million 
there were four principal components to this reduction 
first  we decreased the valuation allowance by million as a result of the transactions described above which utilized our capital loss carryforwards 
second  we decreased the valuation allowance by million on certain unrealized losses as a result of unrealized appreciation in our investment portfolio 
this decrease was reflected as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
third  as a result of million in net realized gains during  we decreased the valuation allowance by million as an increase to income from continuing operations  since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards 
fourth  in the us federal income tax return  we were able to utilize an additional million of capital loss carryforwards that expired in 
table of contents as such  we increased the valuation allowance by million with an equal and offsetting increase to the related deferred tax asset 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to other items reflected as expense from discontinued operations 
in november  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle  resulting in a tax benefit of million recognized as income related to our discontinued operations 
the benefit is primarily due to the concession of our separate account dividends received deduction issue by the irs appeals division  which resulted in the reduction of our liability for this uncertain tax position 
see note income taxes on pages to of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
for additional information 
also in april  we received notification that an interest refund claim filed with the internal revenue service in had been accepted  resulting in a tax benefit of million recognized in discontinued operations 
in  a benefit of million resulting from the settlement with the irs of interest claims for through was recognized in discontinued operations as income 
in january  july  september  and december  we completed transactions which resulted in the realization  for tax purposes only  of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
these transactions enabled us to realize capital loss carryforwards to offset these gains  and resulted in the release of million and million in and  respectively  of the valuation allowance we held against the deferred tax asset related to these capital loss carryforwards 
the total release of million was accounted for as an increase in income from continuing operations of million and million in and  respectively  with the remaining million reflected as a benefit in accumulated and other comprehensive income at december  during  we recognized million of the million in income from continuing operations  related to non segment income 
the remaining amount will be released into income from continuing operations in future years  as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature 
in  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by a total of million  from million to million 
there were four principal components to this reduction 
first  we reduced the valuation allowance by million as a result of the transactions described above which utilized our capital loss carryforwards 
second  we increased the valuation allowance by million for certain tax basis unrealized losses which we did not believe we could utilize 
this increase was reflected as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
third  million of our capital loss carryforwards expired in as a result  we released the million of the valuation allowance attributable to these expirations with an equal and offsetting reduction in the related deferred tax asset 
fourth  as a result of million in net realized capital gains  we decreased our valuation allowance by million as an increase to income from continuing operations since these gains utilized our capital loss carryforwards 
the remaining million decrease was attributable to other items reflected as income from discontinued operations 
in january  we made a million pension contribution  which resulted in both a current deduction of million and the utilization reduction of a deferred tax asset of the same amount 
this contribution is the most significant reason the current tax expense is million in  representing only approximately of the total provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations 
during  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by million  from million to million 
there were two principal components to this reduction 
first  we reversed  through other comprehensive income  the million valuation allowance that we had recognized at december  associated with the tax benefit related to the net unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio at that time 
during  appreciation in the portfolio changed the nature of the tax attribute from that of an asset to that of a liability  and thus  there was no longer a need for that portion of the valuation allowance 
second  as a result of the aforementioned transactions  we reversed million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to other comprehensive income and million of the valuation allowance as an adjustment to income from continuing operations 
the remaining million net increase in our valuation allowance was attributable to other items  and reflected as a million increase in income from continuing operations and a million decrease in income from discontinued operations 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during 
table of contents the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data on pages to of this form k 
reserve for losses and loss expenses see segment results reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses on pages to of this form k for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for loss reserves 
reinsurance recoverable balances we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to a reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
reinsurance recoverables recorded on insurance losses ceded under reinsurance contracts are subject to judgments and uncertainties similar to those involved in estimating gross loss reserves  as disclosed above 
in addition to these uncertainties  our reinsurance recoverables may prove uncollectible if the reinsurers are unable or unwilling to perform under the reinsurance contracts 
in establishing our reinsurance allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of credit risk arising from our exposure to individual reinsurers 
to determine if an allowance is necessary  we consider  among other factors  published financial information  reports from rating agencies  payment history  collateral held and our legal right to offset balances recoverable against balances we may owe 
our reinsurance allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to uncertainty and volatility due to the time lag involved in collecting amounts recoverable from reinsurers 
over the period of time that losses occur  reinsurers are billed and amounts are ultimately collected  economic conditions  as well as the operational and financial performance of particular reinsurers  may change and these changes may affect the reinsurers willingness and ability to meet their contractual obligation to us 
it is also difficult to fully evaluate the impact of major catastrophic events on the financial stability of reinsurers  as well as the access to capital that reinsurers may have when such events occur 
the ceding of insurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the policies  and we will be required to pay the loss and bear collection risk even if the reinsurers fail to meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts 
pension benefit obligations general we currently have a us qualified defined benefit plan  a defined benefit pension plan for our international subsidiary  chaucer  and several smaller qualified and non qualified benefit plans 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits 
in order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans  we must make various estimates and key assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates 
additionally  our chaucer pension plan also must take into consideration inflation rates  specifically related to participant salary increases 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
in addition  we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plans 
two significant assumptions used in the determination of benefit plan obligations and expenses that are dependent on market factors  which have been subject to a greater level of volatility over the past few years  are the discount rate and the return on plan asset assumptions 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
we also use this 
table of contents discount rate in the determination of our pre tax pension expense or benefit 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we generally consider historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations  and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets 
actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses or increase actuarial gains that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity  whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses or decrease actuarial gains that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years 
expenses related to these plans are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year 
our pre tax expense related to our defined benefit plans was million and million for and  respectively 
expenses in include million related to the chaucer pension plan for the period of july  to december  us qualified defined benefit plan prior to  we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our us employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula 
in addition to the cash balance allocation  certain transition group employees  who had met specified age and service requirements as of december   were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment 
as of january   the defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
as of december  and  we determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plan 
bond information used in the yield curve included only those rated aa or better as of december  and  respectively  and had been rated by at least two well known rating agencies 
at december   based upon our qualified plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to this discount curve  we decreased our discount rate to  from at december  for the years ended december  and  the expected rate of return on our qualified plan assets was and  respectively 
the decrease reflects our strategy to shift investment assets from equity securities to fixed maturity investments over several years resulting in our composition of fixed maturities and equities at december   as well as declines in the fixed maturities markets in general 
actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately million and million of gains during and  respectively  as compared to expected returns of approximately million and million  respectively 
the benefit from the investment gains experienced in was essentially offset by a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year 
in  an actuarial loss of approximately million primarily resulting from a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year was partially offset by the benefit from investment gains of approximately million 
these net losses resulted in adjustments to our accumulated net actuarial losses in and of approximately million and million  respectively  which are reflected as decreases to our accumulated other comprehensive income 
the change in these actuarial gains and losses is amortized into earnings in future years 
the adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income from these actuarial losses occurring in and were offset by the amortization of actuarial losses from prior years of million and million in and  respectively 
given the effect of our actual investment experience in  and taking into consideration the decrease in discount rates in  us pension related expenses in are expected to decrease from accordingly  we expect our pre tax pension expense for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan to decrease from approximately million in to approximately million in holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 

table of contents chaucer pension plan prior to  our chaucer segment provided defined benefit pension retirement benefits to certain of its employees 
as of december   the defined benefit section of the pension plan was closed to new members 
the defined benefit obligation for this plan is based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary 
as of december  and the july  acquisition date  we determined our discount rate utilizing a year aa corporate bond index 
at december   based upon our chaucer plan liabilities and cash flows in relation to this index  we decreased our discount rate to  from  at the july  acquisition date 
for the six months ended december   the expected rate of return on plan assets was 
the composition of our chaucer plan assets are equities  fixed maturities  and real estate funds at december  actual returns of the plan investments generated approximately million of losses during the six months ended december  collectively  investment losses experienced in  combined with the decrease in the discount rate  partially offset by a decrease in the inflation rate and changes in other assumptions  resulted in net actuarial losses for the chaucer plan of approximately million 
these losses are reflected as a decrease to our accumulated other comprehensive income 
this balance is amortized into earnings in future periods 
taking into consideration actual investment performance and the decrease in discount rates in  pension related expenses for the chaucer plan are expected to increase in from million to approximately million using the december  gbp to us dollar conversion rate of 
holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our chaucer pension plan are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 
other than temporary impairments we employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all fixed maturity and equity security investments 
the methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process which seeks to ensure that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  the general outlook for market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  and the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost 
with respect to fixed maturity investments  we consider factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay amounts due according to the contractual terms and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
with respect to equity securities  we consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery in value 
we apply these factors to all securities 
we monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration as evidenced by ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments and we consider past events  current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists 
for our impairment review of asset backed fixed maturity securities  we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery 
we consider available information relevant to the collectibility of cash flows  including information about the payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the underlying 
table of contents borrowers  collateral trustee reports  credit ratings analysis and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows 
when an other than temporary impairment of a debt security occurs  and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
if we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it  we separate the other than temporary impairment into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
the amount of the estimated other than temporary impairment that is non credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
we estimate the amount of the other than temporary impairment that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the debt maturity security with the net present value of the debt security s projected future cash flows  discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment 
the non credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the fixed maturity security at the impairment measurement date 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities are recorded as realized losses  which reduce net income and earnings per share 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
for equity method investments  we recognize impairment when evidence demonstrates that a loss in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
during each period  we evaluate whether an impairment indicator has occurred that may have a significant adverse affect on the carrying value of the investment 
impairment indicators may include lower expectations of residual value from a limited partnership  reduced valuations of the investments held by limited partnerships  actual recent cash flows that are significantly less than expected cash flows or any other adverse events since the last financial statements received that might affect the value of the investee s capital 
other than temporary impairments of limited partnerships are recorded as realized losses  which reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share  but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future 
see investments on pages to of this form k for further discussion regarding other than temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized loss position 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these temporary differences are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
consideration is given to available positive and negative evidence  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
valuation allowances are established if  based on the weight of available information  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions 
our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions 
changes in valuation allowances are generally reflected in federal income tax expense or as an adjustment to other comprehensive income loss depending on the nature of the item for which the valuation allowance is being recorded 

table of contents the following are the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities with the associated valuation allowance as of december  deferred tax assets liabilities gross amount valuation allowance net amount in millions tax attributes tax credit carryforwards operating loss carryforwards capital loss carryforwards other insurance reserves  net deferred policy acquisition costs employee benefit plans software capitalization lloyd s underwriting losses not subject to tax other  net investments  net total we have million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and may be used to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income 
based on our projected future taxable income  we expect to utilize these tax credits during the next four to five years 
in addition  we have operating loss carryforwards that relate to current year us net operating loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards from our recently acquired chaucer segment 
the us net operating loss carryforwards expire in and the chaucer net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
based on our projection of future economic conditions  taxable income  reversals of existing taxable temporary liabilities  and our strategic planning strategies  we believe that these operating loss carryforwards will be fully realized 
our capital loss carryforwards relate to the loss from the sale of faflic in and expire in in making our valuation allowance assessment for this deferred tax asset  we considered our carryforward capacity  reversals of deferred tax liabilities related to our investment portfolio  and tax planning strategies that include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery and selling appreciated securities to offset capital losses 
given the nature and the magnitude of the loss and our ability to generate limited capital gains based on current market conditions in the next three years  we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized 
we believe the remaining deferred tax asset from other temporary differences will be fully realizable based on our projected future taxable income and recent financial operations 
although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable  there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability 
future economic conditions and debt market volatility  including increase in interest rates  can adversely impact our tax planning strategies 
statutory surplus of us insurance subsidiaries the following table reflects statutory surplus for our us insurance subsidiaries december in millions total statutory surplus us insurance subsidiaries the statutory surplus for our us insurance subsidiaries decreased million during  primarily due to a million ordinary dividend paid to the holding company by hanover insurance in april and from changes in admitted tax assets

table of contents lloyd s capital requirement chaucer corporate members operate in the lloyd s market  which requires that these members deposit funds  referred to as funds at lloyd s  to support their underwriting interests 
lloyd s sets required capital annually for all participating syndicates based on each syndicates business plans  the rating and reserving environment  and discussions with regulatory and rating agencies 
although the minimum capital levels are set by lloyd s  it is the responsibility of chaucer to continually monitor the risk profiles of its managed syndicates to ensure that the level of funding remains appropriate 
such capital is comprised of cash and cash equivalents  investments  undrawn letters of credit provided by various banks and other assets 
at december   the required capital supporting our lloyd s business totaled million using the december  gbp to us dollar conversion rate of 
we have securities  assets and letters of credit pledged to lloyd s to satisfy these capital requirements at december  and expect to be able to meet these capital requirements in the future 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our us insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by regulators  such as prior notice periods and the requirement that dividends in excess of a specified percentage of statutory surplus or prior year s statutory earnings receive prior approval so called extraordinary dividends 
on april   a million ordinary dividend was paid to the holding company by hanover insurance 
this dividend was used to help fund the acquisition of chaucer 
in and  dividends of million and million  respectively  were paid by hanover  providing cash and securities to the holding company 
dividend payments to the holding company by our chaucer business are regulated by uk law 
dividends from chaucer are dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries 
annual dividend payments from chaucer are limited to retained earnings that are not restricted by capital and other requirements for business at lloyd s 
also  chaucer must provide advance notice to the uk s financial services authority fsa of certain proposed dividends or other payments from fsa regulated entities 
there are currently no plans to repatriate dividends to our holding company from chaucer 
sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during  compared to net cash provided by operations of million in and million in the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to primarily resulted from the absence  in  of a million contribution made to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in  and increased premium collections in  primarily associated with onebeacon business written in and our chaucer business 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to primarily resulted from a million contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in january in addition  cash was used to provide for higher operating expenses and increased loss and lae payments in these cash uses in were almost entirely offset by cash provided by increased written premium in net cash provided by investing activities was million during  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and million in during  cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from million of cash and cash equivalents acquired from chaucer 
this increase was partially offset by cash paid for the chaucer acquisition totaling million  which included an million payment related to a foreign currency exchange forward contract  and the investment of a portion of our chaucer segment s cash into fixed maturities 
during  cash used was primarily related to our net purchases of equity securities and fixed maturities 
additionally  cash was used in in connection with our acquisitions and renewal rights transactions 
during  cash was primarily used as we invested a portion of existing cash into fixed maturities and invested the proceeds from the sale of our life companies into fixed maturities 
additionally  in  cash was used in connection with the one beacon renewal rights agreement  which was funded  in part  by the sale of equity securities 
this investing activity was partially offset by cash provided from sales of fixed maturities to fund our stock repurchase program 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million during  compared to cash used in financing activities of million in and million in during  cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from the issuance  on june   of million of unsecured senior debentures 
cash received from the issuance of debt was partially offset by the repurchase of million of debt  the payment of dividends to our shareholders  repayments of collateral related to our securities lending program  and repurchases of common stock 
during  cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from repurchases of common stock and debt  as well as the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
these were substantially offset by proceeds from the issuance  on february   of million unsecured senior debentures

these uses were partially offset by million of cash inflows from our securities lending program 
also during  a million advance received as part of the fhlbb collateralized borrowing program was offset by million used to repurchase a portion of our corporate debt 
at december   thg  as a holding company  held approximately million of fixed maturities and cash 
we believe our holding company assets are sufficient to meet our future obligations  which consists primarily of the interest on our senior debentures  our dividends to shareholders as and to the extent declared  additional funds relating to the purchase of chaucer  certain costs associated with benefits due to our former life employees and agents  and to the extent required  payments related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries 
we do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend additional funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund holding company obligations  however  we may decide to do so 
dividends to common shareholders are subject to quarterly board approval and declaration 
during  as declared by the board  we paid three quarterly dividends of per share and one quarterly dividend of per share to our shareholders 
the total dividends paid to our shareholders in were million 
we believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends should the board of directors declare them 
we expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements relating to current operations  including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan and chaucer pension plan 
based upon the current estimate of liabilities and certain assumptions regarding investment returns and other factors  our qualified defined benefit pension plan is essentially fully funded as of december  as a result  we currently expect that significant cash contributions will not be required for this plan for several years 
the chaucer pension plan is approximately million underfunded as of december  the ultimate payment amounts for both the defined benefit plan and the chaucer pension plan are based on several assumptions  including but not limited to  the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate for benefit obligations  mortality experience  interest crediting rates and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations 
since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely  changes to our funding obligations in future periods are possible 
our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short term investments 
we believe that the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize the long term economic value of our portfolio  including securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position 
we do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries cash requirements 
we expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell those securities in a loss position before their values fully recover  thereby causing us to recognize impairment charges in that time period 
since october and through december  our board of directors has authorized aggregate repurchases of our common stock of up to million

we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security 
customers typically focus on claims paying ratings  while creditors focus on debt ratings 
investors use both to evaluate a company s overall financial strength
