the year ended december  presented has been updated to exclude international local market trading 
customer activity metrics darts are the predominant driver of commissions revenue from our customers 
average commission per trade is an indicator of changes in our customer mix  product mix and or product pricing 
margin receivables represent credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they own 
margin receivables are a key driver of net operating interest income 
end of period brokerage accounts and net new brokerage accounts are indicators of our ability to attract and retain brokerage customers 

table of contents changes in customer assets are an indicator of the value of our relationship with the customer 
an increase in customer assets generally indicates that the use of our products and services by existing and new customers is expanding 
changes in this metric are also driven by changes in the valuations of our customers underlying securities 
net new brokerage assets are total inflows to all new and existing brokerage accounts less total outflows from all closed and existing brokerage accounts and are a general indicator of the use of our products and services by existing and new brokerage customers 
customer cash and deposits  particularly brokerage related cash  are an indicator of a deepening engagement with our customers and are a key driver of net operating interest income 
company financial metrics corporate cash is an indicator of the liquidity at the parent company 
it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries 
e trade financial tier i leverage ratio is tier i capital divided by average total assets for the holding company for leverage capital purposes 
e trade financial tier i common ratio is tier i capital less elements of tier i capital that are not in the form of common equity  such as trust preferred securities  divided by total risk weighted assets for the holding company 
the tier i leverage and tier i common ratios are non gaap measures as the holding company is not yet held to these capital requirements 
see liquidity and capital resources for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the comparable gaap measures 
e trade bank tier i capital ratio is tier i capital divided by adjusted total assets for e trade bank and is an indication of e trade bank s capital adequacy 
special mention loan delinquencies are loans days past due and are an indicator of the expected trend for charge offs in future periods as these loans have a greater propensity to migrate into nonaccrual status and ultimately charge off 
allowance for loan losses is an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is typically equal to management s forecast of loan losses in the twelve months following the balance sheet date as well as the forecasted losses  including economic concessions to borrowers  over the estimated remaining life of loans modified as troubled debt restructurings tdr 
see summary of critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions used in the allowance for loan losses 
enterprise interest earning assets  in conjunction with our enterprise net interest spread  are indicators of our ability to generate net operating interest income

average enterprise interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for the year ended december  compared to the increase in average enterprise interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to increases in average sweep deposits and average customer payables  offset by a decrease in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
enterprise net interest spread decreased by basis points to for the year ended december  compared to  reflecting yields on average enterprise interest earning assets and the current interest rate environment 
we expect enterprise net interest spread to continue to compress and  given the continued challenges of the current interest rate environment  our enterprise net interest spread could average less than for the year ending december  commissions commissions revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the main factors that affect commissions are darts  average commission per trade and the number of trading days during the period

the provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years  down from its peak of billion for the year ended december  we expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline in compared to  although it is subject to variability from quarter to quarter 
as we transition from the ots to the occ  we are evaluating programs and practices that were designed in accordance with guidance from the ots 
we are working to align certain policies and procedures to the guidance from the occ and have suspended certain loan modification programs that will require changes 
we increased the qualitative reserve in to reflect additional estimated losses during the period of reduced activity in our modification programs  as well as uncertainty around certain loans modified under our previous programs 
once the evaluation of the existing programs and practices is complete and any necessary changes have been implemented  we will re assess the overall qualitative reserve

compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase resulted primarily from higher compensation expense as a result of increasing our financial consultants by  partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation 
advertising and market development advertising and market development expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to this fluctuation was due largely to the planned increase in advertising expenditures in our continuing effort to attract new accounts and customer assets during the year ended december  fdic insurance premiums fdic insurance premiums increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was due primarily to an industry wide change in the fdic insurance premium assessment calculation  effective in the second quarter of professional services professional services increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was due primarily to a million credit in connection with a legal settlement in the third quarter of  which decreased professional services for the year ended december  there were no similar settlements made during the year ended december  communications communications expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was driven primarily by a decline in vendor services fees compared to 
table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was driven by a reserve of million related to an offer to purchase auction rate securities held by customers of e trade securities llc  as well as former customers who purchased auction rate securities through e trade securities llc 
this reserve relates primarily to our estimate of the securities current fair value relative to their par value and includes penalties and other estimated settlement costs 
we also entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the freudenberg action  which resulted in the recording of a net reserve of million for the year ended december  other income expense other income expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to as shown in the following table dollars in millions year ended variance december  vs 
amount corporate interest income corporate interest expense gains on sales of investments  net gains on early extinguishment of debt equity in loss of investments and venture funds total other income expense percentage not meaningful 
total other income expense primarily consisted of corporate interest expense on interest bearing corporate debt for the year ended december  corporate interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to in addition to the stated interest on corporate debt  the corporate interest expense line item included the benefit of discontinued fair value hedges on corporate debt  which decreased million for the year ended december  compared to offsetting interest expense for the year ended december  was a million gain on early extinguishment of debt related to the call of the notes in the second quarter of offsetting corporate interest expense for the year ended december  was a benefit of million related to a legal settlement 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in during the third quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the taxable liquidation of a european subsidiary 
the subsidiary was liquidated for us tax purposes in connection with our international restructuring activities 
this liquidation resulted in the taxable recognition of certain losses  including historical acquisition premiums that we incurred internationally 
this tax benefit resulted in a corresponding increase to the deferred tax assets  which were billion as of december  for the year ended december   our reported pre tax loss was relatively close to breakeven  which resulted in an unusually high effective tax rate 
valuation allowance we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we did conclude that a valuation 
table of contents allowance was required  the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that we are in a cumulative book loss position as of the three year period ended december   which is considered significant and objective evidence that we may not be able to realize some portion of the deferred tax assets in the future 
however  we did not establish a valuation allowance against federal deferred tax assets as of december  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
approximately two thirds of existing federal deferred tax assets are not related to net operating losses and therefore  have no expiration date 
we expect to utilize the vast majority of the existing federal deferred tax assets over the next seven years  with a small balance remaining as a result of the current limitation caused by the ownership change which is expected to be fully utilized in advance of the statutory carry forward period 
our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance focused on identifying significant  objective evidence that we will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future 
we determined that our expectations regarding future earnings are objectively verifiable due to various factors 
one factor is the consistent profitability of the core business  the trading and investing segment  which has generated substantial income for each of the last eight years  including through uncertain economic and regulatory environments 
the core business is driven by brokerage customer activity and includes trading  brokerage cash  margin lending  long term investing and other brokerage related activities 
these activities drive variable expenses that correlate to the volume of customer activity  which has resulted in stable  ongoing profitability in this business 
another factor is the mitigation of losses in the balance sheet management segment  which generated a large net operating loss in caused by the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets 
much of this loss came from the sale of the asset backed securities portfolio and credit losses from the mortgage loan portfolio 
we no longer hold any of those asset backed securities and shut down mortgage loan acquisition activities in in effect  the key business activities that led to the generation of the deferred tax assets were shut down over four years ago 
as a result  the losses in the balance sheet management segment have continued to decline significantly 
in addition  we continue to realize the benefit of various credit loss mitigation activities for the mortgage loans purchased in and prior  most notably  actively reducing or closing unused home equity lines of credit and aggressively exercising put back clauses to sell back improperly documented loans to the originators 
as a result of these loss containment measures  provision for loan losses has declined for three consecutive years  down from its peak of billion for the year ended december  we maintain a valuation allowance for certain of our state deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
at december   we had state deferred tax assets of approximately million that related to our state net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences with a valuation allowance of million against such deferred tax assets 
tax ownership change during the third quarter of  we exchanged billion principal amount of interest bearing debt for an equal principal amount of non interest bearing convertible debentures 
subsequent to the debt exchange  million and million debentures were converted into million and million shares of common stock during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
as a result of these conversions  we believe we experienced a tax ownership change during the third quarter of as of the date of the ownership change  we had federal nols available to carry forward of approximately billion 
section imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation s nols  certain recognized built in losses and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs 
section rules governing when a change in ownership occurs are complex and subject to interpretation  however  an ownership change generally occurs when there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of a corporation by certain shareholders of more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 

table of contents section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre ownership change nols 
in general  the annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change subject to certain adjustments by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused portion of the annual limitation is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire in general  nols may be carried forward years 
in addition  the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased or decreased by built in gains or losses  respectively  which may be present with respect to assets held at the time of the ownership change that are recognized in the five year period one year for loans after the ownership change 
the use of nols arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected unless a corporation experienced an additional ownership change in a future period 
we believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre ownership change nols  but will not limit the total amount of pre ownership change nols we can utilize 
our updated estimate is that we will be subject to an overall annual limitation on the use of our pre ownership change nols of approximately million 
the overall pre ownership change nols  which were approximately billion  have a statutory carry forward period of years the majority of which expire in years 
as a result  we believe we will be able to fully utilize these nols in future periods 
our ability to utilize the pre ownership change nols is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income over the duration of the carry forward periods and will not be impacted by our ability or inability to generate taxable income in an individual year 
compared to we incurred a net loss of million  or per diluted share  on total revenue of billion for the year ended december  commissions  fees and service charges  principal transactions and other revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to  which was driven by a decrease in commissions
