table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item voyage revenue and expense recognition we currently generate our revenue from time charters and voyage charters 
time charter revenue is for a specific period of time at a specific rate per day  and is generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferry service and contracts of affreightment segment s voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are ratably expensed over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
based on our experience  we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require limited estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
vessel lives and depreciation the carrying value of each of our vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased  less depreciation and or impairment charges  if applicable 
we depreciate our vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated based on the type and age of the vessel 
see note a summary of significant accounting policies 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual salvage value 
salvage  or scrap  value is based on a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate to compute each vessel s salvage value 
we apply an initial scrap rate equal to the average applicable scrap rates for the three months preceding the date the vessel is initially placed in service 
an increase in the useful life of a vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge 
on the other hand  a decrease in the useful life of a vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
the useful life and scrap value of all our vessels are reviewed every three years or when specific events or changes occur 
specifically  every three years the scrap value is reviewed and compared to the most recent three year average of steel prices 
the review will be performed for the fiscal year 
if management feels an adjustment is warranted  the salvage value is adjusted based on this updated steel price 
due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of our vessels for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a particular vessel may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of the vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time because the market prices of vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates  second hand vessel sales  the cost of newbuildings and various other factors discussed in this report 
we record impairment losses only when events occur that cause us to believe that the future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
in such instances  we would recognize an impairment charge in the period in which we determine that the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount  and the fair value is below the carrying amount 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  we must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
we test our long lived assets on an individual basis for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
however  we believe there were no triggering events during to support an impairment analysis with respect to our vessels 
for information on recent fixed asset impairment charges  see liquidity and capital resources rail ferry service 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
there are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings a the deferral method where drydocking costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period of the next scheduled drydock  and b expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
we use the deferral method of accounting for drydock costs 
under the deferral method  drydock costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis until the estimated date of the next drydock 
we believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue rather than expensing the costs as incurred 
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  depending on the age and type of vessel  its cargoes and other criteria 
typically  we estimate the date between drydockings to be between and months 
if circumstances change  we will change the length of the amortization period  which can result in adjustments to the amortization of drydock expense 
costs capitalized as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements  or relate to expenditures that add economic life to the vessel  increase the vessel s earnings capacity or improve the vessel s efficiency 
direct costs include the shipyard costs  parts  inspection fees  steel  blasting and painting 
expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
unamortized drydocking costs of vessels that are sold are written off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the year of the vessel s sale 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual defense and settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we believe that insurance and the indemnification of a previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will partially mitigate our exposure 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with asc topic asc 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
as described further in item of this report  our qualifying us flag operations are taxed under the tonnage tax regime rather than under the us corporate income tax regime 
certain foreign operations are exempt from foreign income taxation under existing provisions of the laws of those jurisdictions 
pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain foreign operations will be subject to us income tax when those earnings are repatriated 
our intention has been and remains to indefinitely re invest   and  of our  and respective foreign earnings losses excluded in our foreign subsidiaries  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes against those earnings 
the principal reasons for this position are as follows maintenance of international flag fleet  future expansion of international flag fleet and us flag fleet s operating cash flow needs are adequately met by its operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc asc clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
during the deferred tax assets created by the continued losses of the us filing group resulting in the company moving to an overall net deferred tax asset position 
based on the above factors  it was determined that the establishment of a valuation allowance was warranted 
the valuation allowance was recorded  with the net deferred tax asset being reduced to zero as of december  the company s position has not changed during and the valuation allowance remains in effect as of december   with the net deferred tax asset remaining at a zero balance 
the establishment of the valuation allowance results in a higher effective tax rate for both and in considering the need both for establishment and continuation of a valuation allowance  the company gave consideration to the following factors the company files a consolidated u 
s 
corporate income tax return for its eligible domestic members 
exclusive of the tonnage tax companies  this group has experienced book losses for the three year period 
the book losses have translated into net operating losses for us tax reporting 
derivative instruments and hedging activities under asc topic  in order to consider a derivative instrument as a hedge  i we must designate the instrument as a hedge of future transactions  and ii the instrument must reduce our exposure to the applicable risk 
if the above criteria are not met  we must record the fair market value of the instrument at the end of each period and recognize the related gain or loss through earnings 
if the instrument qualifies as a hedge  net settlements under the agreement are recognized as an adjustment to earnings  while changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded through stockholders equity in other comprehensive income loss 
we currently employ  or have employed in the recent past  interest rate swap agreements  foreign currency contracts  and commodity swap contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by asc topic these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
asc topic requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under asc topic  actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 
impairment of investments our holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are thus carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in carrying value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
we review these investments and our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment when there is evidence that fair value may be below the carrying value 
we write down an investment if fair value is below the carrying value and the impairment is other than temporary 
if we determine that a material decline in fair value below the carrying value is other than temporary  we would record a noncash impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which that determination is made 
the carrying value of that investment would then be written down to its fair value at the end of that period  establishing a new cost basis 
in determining the fair value of an investment and assessing whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  we use significant estimates and considerable judgments 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 

table of contents executive summary overall strategy the company operates a diversified fleet of us and international flag vessels that provide international and domestic maritime transportation services to commercial and governmental customers primarily under medium to long term contracts or contracts of affreightment 
our business strategy consists of identifying growth opportunities as market needs change  utilizing our extensive experience to meet those needs  and continuing to maintain a diverse portfolio of medium to long term contracts  as well as protecting our long standing customer base by providing quality transportation services 
overview in  the company continued to execute its strategy of operating a diversified fleet of vessels under contracts which varied from short tem to long term 
we believe this strategy provides an effective means to manage a volatile and uncertain global economy that has softened freight rates in most markets 
in november of  the company acquired a built multi purpose ice strengthened vessel to service a recently awarded msc contract 
this contract is for a firm one year period after which msc will have three one year options and one month option to extend the contract 
the fixed time charter is expected to generate gross revenues of approximately million for the firm initial one year period and approximately million if all of the options are exercised 
the company also added to its fleet ownership by acquiring two pctc vessels which were previously under operating leases and fixed under long term contracts to a charterer and one capesize bulk carrier vessel operating in a revenue sharing agreement 
our three newly built international flag double hull handysize bulk carriers were completed and delivered to us in january  operating under a revenue sharing agreement with european partners 
in addition  the company also completed a investment position in ten mini bulkers  making final equity payments of million in january all ten mini bulkers operate under short term charters 
finally  the company divested itself of its interest in a partnership which owned warehouse space previously used to support the rail ferry service when it operated out of a new orleans terminal 
as previously reported  the company operates two multi purpose vessels  a small tanker and two container vessels that transport supplies to terminals that service indonesian mining sites which was impacted by a labor strike in mid we do not believe there will be a material impact to our financial results 
results consolidated financial performance for the full year  net income was million  an increase of million as compared to full year reflected in the results is an million gain from the acquisition of the remaining interest in dry bulk cape holding  ltd dry bulk  while the results included an impairment charge of million on the write down of our rail ferry vessels 
excluding the aforementioned gain on the dry bulk acquisition in and the impairment charge  net income decreased from million in to million in total revenues decreased from million to million for the comparable years driven primarily by lower supplemental cargoes and less operating days on our three us flag ro ro vessels under time charter to the msc 
the lower revenues were partially offset by the rail ferry service results which continues to show improvements in its overall cargo carried and revenues from our three new handysize vessels which began operating in january gross voyage profit was million in as compared to million for excluding the previously mentioned impairment charge  gross voyage profit decreased by approximately million or from prior year results 
this decrease was a factor of lower results from our supplemental cargoes  fewer operating days and higher depreciation expenses  partially offset by improvements from our rail ferry service and three new handysize vessels 
our administrative and general expenses were comparable from year to year 
interest expense increased from million to million year on year  reflecting higher debt balances from the financing of our three new handysize vessels as well as the recent purchases and financing of two pctc vessels which were previously operated through operating leases 
we recorded a foreign exchange loss of million in as compared to an million loss in as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
net loss income from unconsolidated entities decreased from a profit of million in to a loss of  for the full year this decrease was the result of operating results from dry bulk reflected in our revenues and expenses as opposed to being recorded on the one line item net loss income from unconsolidated entities due to the acquisition as well as a decrease in results from our interest in oslo bulk 
financial discipline strong balance sheet total cash and marketable securities of million working capital of million operating cash flow for the fourth quarter period of million overview of fleet our time charter segments  which are primarily serviced by our pure car truck carrier vessels generally operating under medium to long term contracts  provide us with a fixed income stream and consistent cash flow  with revenues only impacted by the amount of our off hire time 
the average firm contract charterhire period for our international flag pctc fleet and us flag pctc fleet is approximately five years and three years  respectively 
in addition to this contractually fixed income  we also earn from time to time supplemental income as a result of chartering our us flag pctc vessels back for the carriage of supplemental cargo when available 
in august of  we were awarded a time charter contract with the msc 
the contract is for a firm one year period after which the msc will have three one year options and one eleven month option to extend the contract 
the time charter  which commenced in mid december   is expected to generate gross revenues of approximately million for the firm initial one year period and approximately million if all the options are exercised 
we purchased a built multi purpose ice strengthened vessel to service the contract 
we funded the purchase of this vessel with available cash and by arranging permanent debt financing 
because of recent downturns in our revenues and the overall condition of the global economy  we test our long lived assets quarterly to determine whether or not our projected cash flows exceed the vessel s carrying amount 
based on this assessment  we believe that no impairment existed at december  our rail ferry segment  which is supported by two special purpose vessels  carries loaded rail cars between the us gulf coast and mexico 
since there are no fixed time charter contracts to support this service  this segment is exposed to changes in market conditions 
due to a history of losses  the recent economic downturn  and the inability to replace one of our former major northbound customers  we took an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair values 
no additional indicators of further impairment of these assets were deemed to be present as of december  
table of contents as of december   our fleet consisted of vessels including one newbuilding  of which we owned directly through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
of the vessels  are under individual fixed time charters varying from short  medium and long term in length and all operated within our time charter contracts international flag and time charter contracts us flag segments 
two vessels operate on a voyage basis with no fixed contracts in our rail ferry segment 
we had one handymax vessel delivered in early and a capesize bulk carrier which are operating under short term charters and are part of a revenue sharing agreement with another company 
in february  the operating contracts for three vessels that we previously operated for the msc terminated

the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts us flag overall revenues decreased by or million when comparing to the decrease was driven primarily by a drop in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers  as volumes continue to settle at more historic levels 
the segment s gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the decrease in supplemental cargoes as well as an additional commercial voyage in and lower time charter rates in on our us flag coal carrier 
partially offsetting these decreases was a reduction in lease expense from exercising the early buy out option of a previously leased vessel 
our fixed contract revenues of million and million in and  respectively  represent revenues derived from our fixed time charter contracts  and our variable revenues of million and million for the same periods in and  respectively  represent revenues derived from our supplemental cargoes 
our us flag time charter contracts segment results also include operating contracts for three roll on roll off vessels to the msc 
january we were notified that we would not be awarded contract renewals 
all three vessels operating contracts were terminated in february these three contracts represented of our total revenue in and of the segment revenue 
time charter contracts international flag revenues increased from million in to million in and gross voyage profit for this segment increased from million in to million in the increase in revenues and gross voyage profit is primarily attributable to contributions made by our three new handysize bulk carriers placed in service in the first quarter of  a capesize bulk carrier  which we began consolidating upon acquiring a interest in dry bulk at the end of the first quarter of  and a reduction in lease expense from exercising the early buy out option of a previously leased vessel 
our fixed revenues of million in represent our revenues from fixed contracts 
our variable revenues of million in represent revenues earned by our three new handysize bulk carriers pursuant to a revenue sharing agreement which commenced in january all revenues in were derived under fixed revenue time charter contracts 
contract of affreightment revenues increased from million in to million in our gross voyage profit improved from a  loss in to a  loss in with higher fuel costs offsetting the increase in revenues 
rail ferry service revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to the beneficial effects of our northbound service being used as an alternative source of transportation resulting from outages on mexico s cross border rail service

see foreign currency exchange rate risk on page loss gain on sale of investments decreased from a  profit in to a loss of  in this was due to a loss of  on the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity which owned a new orleans transloading and storage facility in december other income from vessel financing increased from million in to million in due to interest earned on an escalated note receivable on vessels sold to an indonesian company in the third quarter of investment income decreased from million in to  in due to higher cash balances in the first quarter of  higher average balances of interest bearing debt securities in  and an adjustment on returns for the prior year 
foreign exchange loss of million in  a decrease from a million loss in  is associated with the financing of one of our international flag pctc s 
the loss is due to the revaluation of our yen denominated loan due to a strengthening of the value of the yen since the end of the the exchange loss was based on a change in the exchange rate of yen to usd at december  compared to yen to usd at december  see item a risk factors 
income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  on our million of income before equity in net loss income of unconsolidated entities for the year ended december  for the year ended december  our income tax benefit was million on our million of income before equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 
this unfavorable change was based on improvements in our operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate  and our establishment of a valuation allowance in on certain deferred tax assets 
our qualifying us flag operations continue to be taxed under a tonnage tax regime rather than under the normal us corporate income tax regime 
equity in net loss income of unconsolidated entities equity in net loss income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  decreased from million in to a loss of  in the results were primarily driven by our investment in oslo bulk  which reported a loss of million

beginning with the second quarter of  we split time charter contracts operations into two different operating segments  us flag and international flag 
the changes of revenue and expenses associated with each of our segments are discussed within the gross voyage analysis below 
time charter contracts us flag the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to the decrease in the carriage of supplemental cargoes on our us flag pure car truck carriers  which was partially offset by the reduction in in depreciation expense on our us flag coal carrier from extending its economic life to match the extension of the vessel s time charter contract 
gross revenues for the segment decreased from million in to million in primarily as a result of the decrease in supplemental cargoes 
our fixed revenues of million in and million in represent revenues derived from our fixed time charter contracts  and our variable revenues of million in and million in represent revenues derived from our supplemental cargoes 
time charter contracts international flag the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in is primarily due to more operating days on vessels servicing our indonesian customer  and the initial employment of a newly constructed pctc commencing in late march revenues for the segment decreased from million in to million in due to vessels with lower profit margins ending their service in late and early contract of affreightment the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to a loss of  in was primarily due to a decrease in revenues due to a contractually scheduled freight rate adjustment 
rail ferry service gross voyage profit decreased from a million loss in to a million loss in  primarily due to a million impairment charge recognized in on the segment s two roll on roll off special purpose double deck vessels 
adjusted gross voyage profit improved from a million loss in to a million loss in  excluding the impairment charge 
this improvement is mainly due to reduced amortization costs which are discussed further in note x 
in december  we were notified by one of our major northbound customers of their intention to discontinue using the service effective immediately citing a sourcing decision as their reason for the change 
we were able to offset this loss partially with additional northbound volumes driven by our service being used as an alternative source of transportation resulting from outages in mexico s cross border rail service and a negotiated retroactive settlement to reduce our port costs 
we based the aforementioned non cash impairment charge taken in the third quarter of on our determination that the cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets of the rail ferry segment were less than the carrying amount of these assets due partially to the challenge of replacing a major customer lost in late other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from million in to million in this was primarily due to an increase in chartering brokerage income 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g decreased from million in to million in an increase in executive stock compensation was offset by a charge in related to the repayment of certain incentives received from various alabama agencies

interest expense increased from million in to million in due to i entering into a new loan agreement in the third quarter of to finance the purchase of two multi purpose vessels that were subsequently sold to an indonesian company and ii higher interest expense due to the incurrence of bank indebtedness in to fund the final installment owed on our international flag pctc newbuilding

income taxes for  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities  reflecting tax losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate 
for  our benefit was million on million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
our tax benefit decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of improved gross profits of the company s us flag coal carrier and the establishment of a valuation allowance in with respect to our net deferred tax asset as discussed below 
as a result of the recent losses on operations taxed at the us corporate statutory rate  we are unable to rely on projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets associated with such operations 
accordingly  we have assessed the realizability of such deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities  which resulted in the establishment of a full valuation allowance with respect to our net deferred tax assets as of december  the establishment of the valuation allowance had a negative impact on our effective tax rate and future changes to the valuation allowance will impact the effective tax rate 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from million in to million in the results were driven by our investment in dry bulk  which owns two capesize bulk carriers and has two handymax bulk carrier newbuildings on order for delivery in dry bulk contributed million in as compared to million in included in the results is a gain of million on the sale of the remaining panamax bulk carrier by a dry bulk affiliate 
offsetting dry bulk s favorable results were losses of million and  attributable to our investments in oslo bulk and tony bulkers  respectively see note m 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million being partially offset by cash used in investing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for was generated after adjusting for the items listed in our consolidated statements of cash flows  including non cash items such as i depreciation of million  ii amortization of deferred charges of million and iii a million loss on a foreign currency exchange related to the revaluation of our yen denominated loan facility 
these items were partially offset by drydocking payments of million and a million non cash gain on an acquisition relating to the purchase of dry bulk 
in addition  we received cash dividends of  from dry bulk prior to acquiring the remaining interest in it 
net cash used in investing activities of million included capital expenditures of million  classifying million as restricted cash as required by a loan to value covenant in connection with our yen denominated facility  and investments in unconsolidated entities of million  offset by principal payments received under direct financing leases of million  million of cash assumed in the acquisition of of dry bulk  million from proceeds from sales of marketable securities and million from cash received on note receivables 
included in the million of capital expenditures are million for the final installment payment related to the three handysize bulk carriers delivered in january  million for the purchase pursuant to early buy outs of two previously leased pctc vessels  million of installment payments on the handymax bulk carrier newbuilding assumed in the purchase of dry bulk and million for the acquisition of a built multi purpose ice strengthened vessel 
net cash provided by financing activities of million included outflows of regularly scheduled debt payments of million  a line of credit payment of million in the first quarter of  a payment of million to discharge debt assumed in connection with acquiring full control of dry bulk and cash dividends payments of million 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of million from the final bank draw on the facility agreement to finance the construction and delivery of three handysize dry bulk carriers delivered in january and the refinancing of the loan on a capesize vessel in connection with the dry bulk transaction  million received under a secured term loan facility agreement related to the purchase of two previously leased pctc vessels  million received on a term loan for an installment payment on the handymax bulk carrier newbuilding delivered in january   million of loan proceeds to purchase the built multi purpose ice strengthened vessel  and a draw on the line of credit of million in december  which was repaid in full in january 
of the million of cash and cash equivalents reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   approximately million is held overseas and is subject to our non repatriation commitment discussed under the heading tax matters in item of this annual report 
consequently  these funds are not available for use in the united states 
we filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement which we believe may provide us with flexibility to access the public equity and debt markets 
we routinely evaluate the acquisition of additional vessels or businesses and from time to time evaluate possible vessel diversities 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisitions or dispositions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
stock repurchase program on january   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of  shares of our common stock 
we expect that any share repurchases under this program will be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
thereafter  we suspended repurchases until the second quarter of  when we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
since then we have not repurchased any other shares 
unless and until the board otherwise provides  this authorization will remain open indefinitely  or until we reach the  share limit 
debt and lease obligations as of march   we held two vessels under operating contracts  three vessels under bareboat charter or lease agreements and two vessels under time charter agreements 
the types of vessels held under these agreements include i two breakbulk multi purpose vessels  and four container vessels  all of which operate in our time charter us flag and time charter international flag segments  and ii a molten sulphur carrier operating in our contracts of affreightment segment 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities 
see item of this report 
we have lease agreements on our offices in mobile  al  new york  ny and shanghai  china  which expire in april  june and june  respectively 
we also have a lease agreement on our office in singapore  which expires in september  with an option to renew for a further period of three years 
on february   waterman sold a us flag pctc for million under a sale leaseback arrangement 
as a result  we now lease the vessel under a year lease  with early buy out options to repurchase the vessel in and and fair market value at from the proceeds of the aforementioned sale leaseback  we paid off debt in of approximately million  including million related to a loan facility on this vessel 
most of our operating lease agreements have fair value renewal options  early buy out options and fair value purchase options 
most of the agreements impose defined minimum working capital and net worth requirements  impose restrictions on the payment of dividends  and prohibit us from incurring  without prior written consent  additional debt or lease obligations  subject to certain specified exceptions 
in july  we purchased two previously leased vessels for an aggregate purchase price of million pursuant to early buy out options 
on june   we entered into a secured term loan facility agreement that permitted us to borrow up to million  for these purposes 
in july  we drew the full amount of borrowings available under this facility agreement to finance a substantial portion of the aggregate purchase price for the two vessels  and paid the remainder of the purchase price with cash on hand 
all loans under this facility agreement are scheduled to mature on june  for further information  please see our current report on form k dated june  debt covenants substantially all of our credit agreements require us to comply with various loan covenants  including financial covenants that require minimum levels of net worth  working capital and interest expense coverage and a maximum amount of debt leverage 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to its debt obligations and we believe  based on current circumstances  that it is likely that we will continue to meet such covenants in the near future 
the following table represents the actual and required covenant amounts for the twelve months ending december  actual required net worth thousands of dollars working capital thousands of dollars interest expense coverage ratio minimum leverage ratio maximum total assets minus total liabilities 
total current assets minus total current liabilities 
defined as the ratio between consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda to interest expense 
defined as the ratio between consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
in the unanticipated event that our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital  enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
based on current circumstances we believe we can continue to fund our working capital and routine capital investment liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and or accessing available lines of credit 
to the extent we are required to seek additional capital  our efforts could be hampered by the on going uncertainty in the credit markets 
see item a  risk factors 
we presently have variable to fixed interest rate swaps on of our long term debt 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s total thereafter long term debt including current maturities interest payments operating leases vessel commitments total by period included in operating leases is our approximate million obligation to the alabama state port authority related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  alabama  to be paid by us over the ten year terminal lease 
we expect to meet this long term obligation  reported in other long term liabilities  by the usage fees paid by our rail ferry vessels in the mobile port 
also included are lease payments related to the above described sale leaseback transaction in february the above contractual obligations table does not include contributions that we expect to make to our pension plan and the union sponsored pension plans in and beyond  as described further below and in note f to our consolidated financial statements 
current economic and market issues the worldwide economy continues to be impaired by slow growth and uncertainities 
nonetheless  customers who have owed us payments under our fixed contracts have generally paid us in full within their customary terms 
for more information  see our list of risk factors included in item a of this report 
during  the financial markets continued to be buffeted by market volatility 
due to the instability of foreign governments  market returns were hindered due to potential risk 
we continued to evaluate our pension diversification allocations 
we reduced our overall exposure to equities during this period 
as of the start of  we have engaged a new financial consultant and while we are discussing with them various investment options to help lessen our risk  we have increased our equity positions in the pension fund to that of our benchmark of equities and fixed instruments 
we are also discussing the usage of actively managed funds to enhance our index based investments and address potential risk postures 
we expect to contribute approximately  to our pension plan for the fiscal year this increase is necessary due to the reduction in the market driven discount rate which the plan is required to use for the calculation of future liabilities 
we are evaluating an overall plan to address and fund the required contribution to overcome the effect of the discount rate reduction 

table of contents rail ferry service in the third quarter of  we determined that the cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets of our rail ferry segment were less than the carrying amount of these assets and we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of these assets was estimated based upon an independent third party appraiser level inputs 
we intend to continue to operate the rail ferry segment as long as it can generate positive cash flows and further utilize the vessels available capacity to generate a return that would be accretive to net income

the facility matures in and is based on a year amortization 
as a result of increasing our ownership in dry bulk from to on march   we presently own a interest in a handymax bulk carrier newbuilding  which was delivered in january our total investment in this newbuilding is approximately million

under tranche b  we made draws for million in november and million in january and contributed another million and million upon launching of the vessel and final delivery in january for further information on this agreement  see our current report on form k  dated june  in december  we acquired for million a investment in oslo bulk as oslo bulk which in contracted to build eight new mini bulkers 
all of the mini bulkers have been delivered and deployed as of july during  we invested an additional million in tony bulkers pte ltd tony bulkers  an affiliate of oslo bulk  for our share of the installment payments for two additional new mini bulkers  both of which have been delivered and deployed as of july we paid our remaining share of installment payments associated with these two mini bulkers of approximately million in january these investments are accounted for under the equity method and our share of earnings or losses is reported in our consolidated statements of operations  net of taxes

liquidity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities decreased from million at december   to million at december  the decrease in our working capital was temporary and is primarily related to construction payments on our three handysize bulk carriers delivered in january permanent financing replenished the installment payments in early january cash and cash equivalents decreased during by million to a total of million 
this decrease was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million being offset by cash used by investing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt

this decrease was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash provided by financing activities of million  offset by cash used by investing activities of million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not material 
we have entered into eight interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of  one in november of  three in september of  one in january  and one in june  in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates  and our weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we did not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to the risk of increases in the price of fuel necessary to operate both our rail ferry service and contract of affreightment segments 
we have fuel surcharges and escalation adjustments in place for both segments  which we believe managed the price risk for those services during we estimate that a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  the additional fuel costs assume no additional revenue would be generated from fuel surcharges  even though we believe that we could have passed on to our customers some or all of the fuel price increases through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period  subject to the need to maintain competitive freight rates 
our charterers in the time charter contracts us flag and the time charter contracts international flag segments are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements  thus  we have no direct fuel price risk in these segments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments during these contracts mature on various dates during the fair value of these contracts at december   is an asset of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be an asset of  on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into a senior secured term loan facility denominated in japanese yen for the purchase of a ceu newbuilding pctc  which was completed and delivered in march the decision to enter into this yen loan was driven by the lower yen interest rates versus the usd interest rates at that time 
subsequently  we entered into a yen interest rate swap the facility designed to cap the interest at 
in june  we received notification that the banking institution would be exercising their option to reduce the yen financing on this vessel from to of the delivered vessel cost 
the loan was fully drawn in march to the full amount available of yen  under current accounting guidelines  since this facility is not denominated in our functional currency  the outstanding balance of the facility as of the end of each reporting period is to be revalued  with any adjustments recorded to earnings 
due to the amount of the facility  we may sustain fluctuations that may cause material swings in our reported results 
as an example  a hypothetical to yen increase or decrease on the exchange rate between the us dollar and yen  which was to yen at december   would impact our earnings by approximately  to million for the reporting period see item a risk factors 
while we believe that these fluctuations may smooth out over time  any particular reporting period could be materially impacted by these adjustments 
there was a appreciation in the yen to usd exchange rate at december  compared to december   resulting in a million foreign exchange loss for the year ended december   reported under interest and other on our consolidated statement of income 
we continue to monitor the movements in the foreign currency markets in order to take advantage of potential opportunities 
from time to time over the past year  the japanese government has intervened in the foreign currency market in an attempt to weaken the value of the yen 
we bought forward contracts to purchase yen to cover our installments due under the facility for the periods december  and march  the rate of exchange for these transactions was approximately yen to usd  with total usd equivalents of  on january  we purchased another million yen to cover the june  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of  on april   we purchased another million yen to cover the september  installment for to usd  or a usd equivalent of  due to the strengthening of the yen throughout the third and fourth quarters of  we have not purchased any further contracts  but will continue to monitor the currency markets
