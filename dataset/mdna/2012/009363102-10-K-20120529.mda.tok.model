results of operations compared to overview airgas had net sales for the year ended march  fiscal or current year of billion compared to billion for the year ended march  fiscal or prior year  an increase of 
total same store sales increased  with hardgoods up and gas and rent up 
acquisitions contributed sales growth in the current year 
the same store sales growth for the current year was driven by both volume and price  with sales volumes up and pricing up 
the increase in sales volumes reflects strength in the company s manufacturing  petrochemical and energy customers  with relative outperformance in the hardgoods business on the strength of welding and automation equipment sales 
higher pricing reflects a broad based price increase on gas and rent effective march  and  to a lesser extent  an additional price increase on gas and rent effective december  the pricing actions were designed to offset rising product  operating and distribution costs as well as support ongoing investments in production and distribution capabilities to support and efficiently meet the growing demands of the company s customers 
the consolidated gross profit margin excluding depreciation in the current year was  a decline of basis points from the prior year  reflecting continued outperformance of hardgoods sales  a mix shift within hardgoods to lower margin welding and automation equipment  and an increase in sales to large customers that generally carry lower gross profit margins excluding depreciation and a lower net cost to serve 
the company s operating income margin increased to  a basis point improvement over the prior year 
additionally  the current and prior year s operating income margins were burdened by basis points and basis points  respectively  of net special charges 
the current year also included a basis point negative impact from sap see enterprise information system section below implementation costs and depreciation expense compared to only basis points of such sap costs in the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share rose to in the current year versus in the prior year

net special charges in each year consisted of the following years ended march  effect on diluted eps restructuring and other special charges costs benefits related to unsolicited takeover attempt multi employer pension plan withdrawal charges losses on the extinguishment of debt one time interest penalty income tax benefits special charges  net enterprise information system the company continued its phased  multi year rollout of its highly customized sap enterprise information system during the current year 
at this stage in the company s phased implementation  each of its four bscs  into which the regional company accounting and administrative functions will be consolidated upon converting to sap  are firmly in place 
through march   the company has successfully converted its safety telesales and hardgoods infrastructure businesses and five regional distribution companies to the sap platform 
two additional regional distribution company conversions are scheduled for the first quarter of the year ending march  fiscal 
the company expects to have eleven of its twelve regional distribution companies converted to sap by the end of calendar year the remaining regional company will be converted in the first quarter of calendar 
table of contents with more than half of the company s business operating on sap  the company believes the implementation risk associated with the remaining business units has been significantly diminished and is beginning to focus more on attaining benefits 
the company incurred the highest level of expenses related to the sap implementation in fiscal  as the first five of the regional distribution companies  including all four bscs  were converted during this period 
total implementation costs and depreciation expense related to the sap system were and per diluted share for the years ended march  and  respectively  and such costs  net of expected benefits  are estimated to be in the range of to per diluted share for the year ending march  the company expects the combination of lower implementation costs and the increase in sap related benefits to yield year over year earnings accretion of between and per diluted share in fiscal above and beyond the company s base business performance

each of the company s twelve regional distribution companies operated prior to conversion to sap or operates its own accounting and administrative functions 
enabled by the company s conversion to a single information platform across all of its regional companies as part of the sap implementation  the restructuring will allow airgas to more effectively utilize its resources across regional company boundaries and form an operating structure that will help airgas leverage the full benefits of its new sap platform

for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings

at march   the company had five variable interest rate swaps outstanding with a notional amount of 
table of contents million

the net gain or loss recorded in earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness related to the designated fair value hedges was immaterial for the years ended march   and the company measures the fair value of its interest rate swaps using observable market rates to calculate the forward yield curves used to determine expected cash flows for each interest rate swap agreement 
the discounted present values of the expected cash flows are calculated using the same forward yield curve 
the discount rate assumed in the fair value calculations is adjusted for non performance risk  dependent on the classification of the interest rate swap as an asset or liability 
if an interest rate swap is a liability  the company assesses the credit and non performance risk of airgas by determining an appropriate credit spread for entities with similar credit characteristics as the company 
if  however  an interest rate swap is in an asset position  a credit analysis of counterparties is performed assessing the credit and non performance risk based upon the pricing history of counterparty specific credit default swaps or credit spreads for entities with similar credit ratings to the counterparties 
the company does not believe it is at risk for non performance by its counterparties 
however  if an interest rate swap is in an asset position  the failure of one or more of its counterparties would result in an increase in interest expense and a reduction of earnings 
the company compares its fair value calculations to the contract settlement values calculated by the counterparties for each swap agreement for reasonableness 
interest expense a majority of the company s variable rate debt is based on a spread over libor 
based on the company s fixed to variable interest rate ratio  for every basis point increase in libor  the company estimates that its annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
