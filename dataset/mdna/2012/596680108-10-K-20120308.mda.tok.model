rates middlesex in january  middlesex filed an application with the njbpu seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately million per year 
the request was as a result of capital investments middlesex has made  or has committed to make  as well as increased operations and maintenance costs 
we cannot predict whether the njbpu will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
a decision by the njbpu is not expected until the fourth quarter in august  middlesex implemented a njbpu approved pwac  which allows for the recovery of increased costs of million to purchase untreated water from the njwsa and treated water from a non affiliated regulated water utility 
it is expected that the pwac rate will reset to zero as part of the ultimate decision rendered in the aforementioned middlesex base rate increase request 
in march  the njbpu granted an increase in middlesex s annual operating revenues of  or million 
the increase was necessitated by increased costs  as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of million based on a return on equity of 
tidewater in september  tidewater filed an application with the depsc seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately million per year 
the request was made as a result of capital investments tidewater has made  or has committed to make  as well as increased operations and maintenance costs

a decision by the depsc is not expected until the second half of in connection with the rate increase application  tidewater implemented a depsc approved interim rate increase  subject to refund  on november  
table of contents a dsic is a depsc approved rate mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in non revenue producing capital improvements to the water system between base rate proceedings 
the following summarizes tidewater s approved dsic rates from january  through november   when tidewater s dsic was set to in connection with the aforementioned interim rate increase date january  july  increase cumulative in september  the depsc approved an overall or million increase in tidewater s base rates 
this rate increase approval is based on a return on equity 
tesi in july  tesi filed an application with the depsc seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately million per year 
the request was made as a result of capital investments tesi has made  or has committed to make  as well as increased operations and maintenance costs 
we cannot predict whether the depsc will ultimately approve  deny  or reduce the amount of the request 
a decision by the depsc is not expected until mid in connection with the rate increase application  tesi implemented a depsc approved interim rate increase  subject to refund  on september  southern shores effective june   the depsc approved a multi year agreement for a phased in base rate increase for southern shores 
this increase was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of southern shores primary water treatment facilities  as well as by increased operating costs 
under the terms of the agreement  which expires on june   southern shores also increased rates on january   and will do so on each successive january st through  to generate approximately million of additional revenue on an annual basis with each increase 
thereafter  rate increases  if any  cannot exceed the lesser of the regional consumer price index or 
in accordance with the tariff established for southern shores  a rate increase of was implemented in january twin lakes in december  twin lakes and the interveners in the twin lakes rate case reached a settlement that provided a million  three year phased in base rate increase for twin lakes 
this increase was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of the twin lakes system  as well as by increased operating costs 
the settlement was approved by the papuc in march outlook revenues for are expected to be favorably impacted by interim and final approved rate increases at middlesex  tidewater  tesi  southern shores and twin lakes 
in addition  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater expect to file for rate increases in the rate increases that middlesex  tidewater  tesi  twin lakes  pinelands water and pinelands wastewater filed  or expect to file  have not been approved by each company s respective utility commission 
there can be no assurances that the requested rate increases will be approved in whole or in part or when the final decisions will be rendered 
ongoing economic conditions continue to negatively impact our customers water consumption  particularly the level of water usage by our commercial and industrial customers in our middlesex system 
in the second half of  we began to see an increase in usage by our commercial and industrial customers 
however  we are unable to determine when these customers water demands may fully return to previous levels  or if a reduced level of demand will continue indefinitely 
we were given appropriate recognition for a portion of this decrease in customer consumption in middlesex s march rate increase 

table of contents revenues and earnings are influenced by weather 
overall customer water consumption decreased in due to less favorable weather as compared to changes in usage patterns  as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  are the primary factors in determining the need for rate increase requests 
we continue to implement plans to streamline operations and reduce operating costs 
as a result of ongoing challenging economic conditions impacting the pace of new residential home construction  there may be an increase in the amount of ps i costs that will not be currently recoverable in rates 
if it is determined that recovery is unlikely  the applicable ps i costs will be charged against income in the period of determination 
changes in certain actuarial assumptions  including a lower discount rate and revised plan participant mortality factors  as well as a lower actual return in on assets held in our retirement plan funds resulted in a significant increase in our underfunded employee benefit plan obligation and will result in higher employee benefit plan expense and cash contributions in tidewater and middlesex have included these increased plan expenses in their rate increase applications currently under review by the respective utility commissions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of employee benefit plans

the effect of those factors on net income is discussed in the results of operations section above

increases in certain operating costs impact our liquidity and capital resources 
middlesex and several of its subsidiaries filed for rate increases in and january there can be no assurances however  that the respective utility commissions will approve the anticipated rate increase requests in whole or in part or when the decisions will be rendered 
we continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize the lag between the time we experience increased operating and capital costs and the time we receive appropriate rate relief 
capital expenditures and commitments to fund our capital program  we use internally generated funds  short term and long term debt borrowings  and when market conditions are favorable  proceeds from sales of common stock under our drp and offerings to the public

table of contents the table below presents our known contractual obligations for the periods specified as of december  payment due by period millions of dollars total less than year years years more than years long term debt notes payable interest on long term debt purchased water contracts wastewater operations total the table above does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for postretirement benefit plan obligations 
the effect on the timing and amount of these payments resulting from potential changes in actuarial assumptions and returns on plan assets cannot be estimated 
in  the company contributed million to its postretirement benefit plans and expects to contribute approximately million in critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and standards often requires the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to the calculation of pension and postretirement benefits  unbilled revenues  and the recoverability of certain assets  including regulatory assets 
the company bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and current operating environment 
changes in any of the variables that are used for the company s estimates  assumptions and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
regulatory accounting we maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries  which account for approximately of operating revenues and of total assets  are subject to regulation in the states in which they operate 
those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities rules and guidelines  which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements 
in those instances  the company follows the guidance in the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic regulated operations regulatory accounting 
in accordance with regulatory accounting  costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate making purposes in future rates 
accordingly  we have recorded costs and obligations  which will be amortized over various future periods 
any change in the assessment of the probability of rate making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item 
we have no reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future 

table of contents revenues revenues from metered customers include amounts billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period 
the estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate and economic conditions 
differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period 
revenues from unmetered customers are billed at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service period 
revenues from the perth amboy management contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees 
fixed fees  which have been set for the life of the contract  are billed monthly and recorded as earned 
variable fees  which are based on billings and other factors and are not material  are recorded upon approval of the amount by perth amboy 
postretirement benefit plans the costs for providing postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
future postretirement benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other demographic factors related to the population participating in the company s postretirement benefit plans  all of which can change significantly in future years 
we maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to march  in addition  the company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers 
the company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions other benefits plan for substantially all of its retired employees 
employees hired after march  are not eligible to participate in the other benefits plan 
coverage includes healthcare and life insurance 
the allocation by asset category of postretirement benefit plan assets at december  and is as follows pension plan other benefits plan asset category target range equity securities debt securities cash commodities total the discount rate  compensation increase rate and long term rate of return utilized for determining our postretirement benefit plans future obligations as of december  are as follows pension plan other benefits plan discount rate compensation increase long term rate of return 
table of contents for the valuation  costs and obligations for our other benefits plan assumed a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits in with a decline of per year for and per year for  resulting in an annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of by year the following is a sensitivity analysis for certain actuarial assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations pbo and expenses for our postretirement benefit plans pension plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase  discount rate decrease  other benefits plan actuarial assumptions estimated increase decrease on pbo s estimated increase decrease on expense s discount rate increase  discount rate decrease  healthcare cost trend rate increase  healthcare cost trend rate decrease  the discount rates used at our december measurement date for determining future postretirement benefit plans obligations and costs are determined based on market rates for long term  high quality corporate bonds specific to our pension plan and other benefits plan s asset allocation 
the expected long term rate of return for pension plan and other benefits plan assets is determined based on historical returns and our asset allocation 
recent accounting standards see note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have final maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of existing long term debt instruments will mature 
applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on our earnings
