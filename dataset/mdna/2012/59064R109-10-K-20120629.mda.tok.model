table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mesa laboratories  inc has two segments our instrument division manufactures and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in connection with the healthcare  pharmaceutical  food and beverage  medical device  and petrochemical industries 
our biological indicators division manufactures and markets biological indicators and distributes chemical indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization processes in the hospital  dental  medical device and pharmaceutical industries 
our company follows a philosophy of manufacturing a high quality product and providing a high level of on going service for those products 
our revenues come primarily from sales of products  parts and disposables  and services 
product sales are dependent on several factors  including general economic conditions  both domestic and international  customer capital spending trends  competition  introduction of new products  and acquisitions 
biological indicator products are disposable and are used on a routine basis for quality control  thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions 
instrumentation products have a longer life  and their purchase by our customers is somewhat discretionary  so sales are more sensitive to general economic conditions 
parts and service demand is driven by our customers quality control and regulatory environments  which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrumentation products 
we typically evaluate costs and pricing annually 
our policy is to price our products competitively and  where possible  we try to pass along cost increases in order to maintain our margins 
as part of the integration of our biological indicator acquisitions we have been adjusting prices to achieve price parity for similar products 
gross profit is affected by our product mix  manufacturing efficiencies and price competition 
the biological indicator market is more competitive than that of our instrumentation products  thus the gross margin percentages are lower 
generally  an increase in biological indicator product sales compared to instrumentation product sales would result in a lower overall gross margin 
selling expense is driven primarily by labor costs  including salaries and commissions 
accordingly  they may vary with sales levels 
labor costs and amortization of intangible assets drive of general and administrative expense 
research and development expense is predominantly comprised of labor costs 
discussion of key indicators and trends acquisitions in december  april and december  impacted our current assets and working capital  as we used available cash and incurred debt to complete those transactions 
during the year ended march   we were still integrating these acquisitions  which impacted the key indicators 
the results for the year ended march   reflect our successful integration of these acquisitions performance ratios gross margin  operating margin and net profit margin are at or near the same levels as and revenues  gross profit and net income have all increased due to having a full year of operations from the acquisitions  successfully integrating the acquisitions  and organic growth 

table of contents results of operations year ended march  percent dollars in thousands change change revenues cost of revenues gross profit gross margin operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development impairment of intangibles net income net profit margin revenues the following table summarizes our revenues by source year ended march  percent dollars in thousands change change biological indicators product instruments product parts and disposables service total instruments total approximately half of the biological indicator revenue growth of was organic  due primarily to expanding markets 
an asset acquisition in december  contributed approximately  or  to the biological indicator revenue growth 
instruments organic revenue growth may be attributed to our signing new distributors  both domestic and international  as well as customers upgrading or expanding as economic uncertainties lessened 
cost of revenues gross profit gross profit for instruments increased approximately  for the year ended march   compared to this improvement was driven by relatively flat fixed costs with increased sales volumes  coupled with manufacturing efficiencies 
we also integrated manufacturing of one product line from a third party to our facility in december  which contributed an additional gross profit of approximately  for the year ended march  biological indicator gross profit increased approximately  for the year ended march   compared to this increase was due to organic revenue growth and the addition of the apex line of products in december  
table of contents operating expenses selling expenses for biological indicators increased approximately  in fiscal compared to  which included integrating the marketing for the december acquisition 
instruments selling expense increased approximately  in fiscal compared to  due to higher commissions and adding individuals to the sales force 
as a percent of sales  selling expense remained relatively flat 
general and administrative expense increased in fiscal  compared to  due to a  contingent liability for estimated sales taxes  increased labor costs of approximately  for additional personnel and compensation adjustments  additional amortization of approximately  from acquisitions in fiscal  offset by cost reductions  primarily involving reduced acquisition costs 
research and development expense decreased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal overall spending on research and development  however  increased  as we capitalized  associated with biological indicator technology 
this was recorded as an intangible asset because it has alternative future uses 
we determined that the carrying value of an instruments indefinite lived intangible was greater than its estimated fair value and in february  we recorded an impairment loss of  fair value was estimated using the royalty replacement approach  whereby a royalty percentage is applied to forecasted revenues and discounted to determine the present value 
while gross profit and cash flows have shown improvement since the intangible was acquired  revenues have not grown at the level originally used to value the intangible 
net income net profit margin net income varied consistently with the growth in revenues and gross profit  as we managed our other expenses  and income tax expense increased commensurate with our growth in profitability 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity may include cash generated from operations  working capital  and potential equity and debt offerings 
we believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short term and long term needs 
our more significant uses of resources include quarterly dividends to shareholders  payment of debt obligations  long term capital equipment expenditures and potential acquisitions 
we invest surplus cash in various interest bearing instruments  including money market funds 
all investments are fixed dollar investments with variable rates in order to minimize the risk of principal loss 
in february  we entered into a three year agreement for a  revolving line of credit and up to  of letters of credit the credit facility 
funds from the credit facility may be used for general working capital and corporate needs  retiring existing debt  or to support acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in february we also extinguished our obligations under our previous debt agreement 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
we had working capital of approximately  and  respectively  at march  and the growth in working capital is impacted by higher sales and net income in fiscal compared to  and the use of cash in fiscal for acquisitions  offset by the repayment of debt in fiscal at march   we had unused capacity under our credit facility of we routinely evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions 
future material acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital  assume third party debt or incur other long term obligations 
we have the option to utilize both equity and debt instruments as vehicles for the long term financing of our investment activities and acquisitions

risk factors of this report for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of mesa laboratories  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these accounting policies are described further in the notes to the financial statements in item accounts receivable we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on overall historic write offs  the age of our receivable balances  and the payment history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information  we may experience material changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  based on standards using the first in  first out method fifo to determine cost 
we evaluate standard costs annually  unless circumstances necessitate a mid year evaluation for specific items 
our work in process and finished goods inventory includes labor and overhead  which are estimated based on trailing twelve months of expense and standard labor hours for each product 
our biological indicator inventory is tracked by lot number  thus it is generally based on actual hours 
we monitor inventory cost compared to selling price in order to determine if a lower of cost or market reserve is necessary 
at year end we perform a complete physical inventory observation 
throughout the year  we estimate and maintain an inventory reserve  as needed  for such matters as obsolete inventory  shrink and scrap 
this reserve may fluctuate as our assumptions change due to new information  discrete events  or changes in our business  such as entering new markets or discontinuing a specific product 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of long lived assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  and amortizable intangibles has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
indefinite lived intangibles are evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying amount 
our analyses may require management to apply judgment in evaluating whether an indication of impairment triggering event has occurred  estimating future cash flows  as well as estimating the fair values 
as of march   we evaluated our long lived assets for potential impairment 
based on our evaluation  an impairment charge of  was taken for an indefinite lived intangible 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
our evaluation may require management to apply judgment in 
table of contents evaluating whether changes in circumstances provide an indication of impairment  as well as estimating fair values 
based on our evaluation as of march   there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of option grants using the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate the volatility and forfeiture rate 
under our current plan  we recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the service period
