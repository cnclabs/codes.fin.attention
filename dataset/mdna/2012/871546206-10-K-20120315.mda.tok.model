table of contents customers our oem solutions business supplies products primarily to manufacturers in the medical device market 
our customers include large orthopedic device manufacturers  including biomet inc  depuy orthopaedics  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  depuy  medtronic inc  smith nephew plc  stryker corp 
and zimmer holdings  inc zimmer as well as a wide range of start up and smaller companies in hip  knee  trauma  spine  and extremities 
we also have established relationships  primarily through our case product offerings  with leading medical device manufacturers and distributors in numerous other medical device market segments  including cardinal health  inc  karl storz  edward lifesciences and st 
jude medical inc our symmetry surgical business supplies products primarily to hospitals and other sites of care 
with the acquisition of the codman surgical instruments business  symmetry surgical will have the opportunity to serve every hospital in the us as well as establish a growing presence with hospitals in countries worldwide 
our relationships with sites of care are often through group purchasing organizations  proprietary hospital chains  or government funded institutions 
in our oem solutions business we sold to over customers in fiscal and in our symmetry surgical business we sold to over  customers 
sales to our ten largest customers across total symmetry represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
our two largest customers accounted for and of our revenue in fiscal and were  in alphabetical order  depuy and stryker corp 
our three largest customers accounted for  and of our revenue in fiscal and were  in alphabetical order  depuy  stryker corp and zimmer 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal or fiscal we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each of our largest customers  which mitigates our reliance on any particular customer 
over the past six years  we have reduced our concentration in the orthopedic industry through various acquisitions  which increased our presence in non orthopedic markets 
our symmetry surgical segment went from no sales five years ago  to over of our total symmetry sales in and we expect symmetry surgical to represent approximately of our sales in we sell our products to customers domestically and in a number of regions outside the us in addition  our customers often distribute globally products purchased from us in the us set forth below is a summary of percent of revenue by selected geographic locations in our last three fiscal years  based on the location to which we shipped our products

fiscal year ended united states ireland united kingdom other foreign countries total net revenues sales and marketing our oem solutions sales and marketing efforts emphasize our design and engineering expertise  internally developed symmetry products  manufacturing capabilities  international distribution network and ability to provide customers with a comprehensive product offering 
we present our products to customers in a total solutions concept which offers the customer a collaborator for developing complete implant  instrument and case solutions while working to create and respond to opportunities for any one of our product offerings 
our sales and marketing personnel are based worldwide and serve our oem customers 
our sales personnel are trained in all of our products in order to cross sell and identify opportunities outside their immediate area of focus 
while we attempt to diminish our reliance on any one purchasing decision by serving several product teams and facilities within each oem customer  customers are increasingly consolidating their procurement activities across multiple entities 
our customer base for cases extends into nearly every segment of the medical device market 
we believe there is an opportunity to leverage our existing relationships among this customer base to achieve greater penetration of our customized instrument and implant products 
we intend to increase our marketing of implants  instruments and our total solutions concept to these customers 
our sales personnel are technically trained and are based in close proximity to or located at our largest 
table of contents customers sites 
this physical proximity allows sales personnel to engage quickly with the marketing  design  engineering and purchasing staffs of these orthopedic device manufacturers 
our sales people are empowered to bring in design and engineering product development teams to facilitate a customer s efforts 
our goal is to collaborate with customers early in the development cycle and to continue through production  packaging  delivery and logistics 
our symmetry surgical sales and marketing efforts emphasize the quality  clinical performance  and comprehensive breadth of our product line 
sales and marketing personnel are predominantly located in the u 
s  although we are establishing regionally based marketing leaders to assist in driving growth through our global network of distributors 
us sales are through a combination of direct representatives as well as valued distributors in certain geographic regions 
our hospital customers include clinicians  or directors  hospital materials management  hospital central sterilization  multi hospital strategic sourcing entities  and group purchasing organizations 
our efforts include tender opportunities for new or updated or where customers seek to outfit a full range of capabilities  new surgeons or new services being added to an existing or requiring a specific clinical focus of instruments  introduction of specialized clinical innovation and new products  and replacement of existing products which have reached the end of their life cycle 
our customer interactions often involve training and education in the use of our products 
our sales personnel are technically trained and are based in the territories they serve 
this enables us to be responsive to the needs of our customers and actively involved in the planning and developing of future opportunities 
manufacturing and materials our oem solutions segment has manufacturing facilities in the us  united kingdom  france  ireland and malaysia 
we continue to make investments to modernize our production facilities  improve our production processes and develop superior technical skills that complement our manufacturing capabilities 
these investments have allowed us to continue to improve the quality of our products  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve our efficiency 
our manufacturing processes include forging 
our forging process uses presses to force heated metal between two dies called tooling that contain a precut profile of the desired implant 
the forging process enhances the strength of an implant  which is important for hip stems and other implants that must withstand significant stress 
many customers prefer forging because it provides greater mechanical properties 
we forge gross shaped  near net shaped and net shaped implants 
our know how enables us to produce precision net shaped forgings in large volumes 
casting 
in the casting process  metal is heated until it is liquid and then poured into an implant mold 
casting can be used to produce implants with intricate shapes 
we have developed a technologically advanced  highly automated casting facility in the united kingdom 
plastic and metal forming 
our know how and technology facilitates our extensive plastic and metal forming capabilities 
we use thermoform processes to draw uniform plastic cases and specialized equipment to form metal 
our laser controlled metal working machines allow us to punch and shape metal in intricate and complex detail 
machining finishing 
machining is used extensively to enhance our forged  cast and formed products 
we use computer numerically controlled  multi axis and wire electric discharge equipment to cut  bend  punch  polish and otherwise shape or detail metal or plastic 
our finishing processes include polishing  laser etch marking  graphics and other customer specific processes 
the majority of products that we produce are customized to the unique specifications of our customers 
our ability to maintain flexible operations is an important factor in maintaining high levels of productivity 
we endeavor to use just in time manufacturing and flexible manufacturing cells in our production processes 
just in time manufacturing is a production technique that minimizes work in process inventory and manufacturing cycles 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
cell manufacturing provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs  which enhances our ability to maintain product volumes that are consistent with our customers requirements and reduce our level of inventory 

table of contents we use raw materials  including plastic  titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other components in the manufacture of our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  from a single supplier for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases 
our symmetry surgical business does not engage in manufacturing  although it operates quality and procurement centers in the united states and germany 
these centers engage with suppliers including symmetry medical s oem solutions business to manufacture to our specifications 
our manufacturers use raw materials  including plastic  titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other components in the manufacture of our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources for our manufacturers  they may rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we are aware that the patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  is sourced from a single supplier for use in our plastic cases 
quality assurance we maintain a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control program  which includes the control and documentation of all material specifications  operating procedures  equipment maintenance and quality control methods 
our quality systems are based upon fda requirements and the iso standards for medical device manufacturers 
we believe that all of our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with regulations applicable to them 
for example  in the us  france  malaysia and united kingdom these regulations include the current good manufacturing practice regulations and other quality system regulations administered by the fda 
specific us based facilities are registered with and subject to inspection by the fda 
our line of standard cases received fda k clearance  which can reduce our customers burden in obtaining fda approval 
the europe  malaysia and specific us based facilities are iso registered and audited annually 
our facilities have obtained numerous industry specific quality and regulatory assurance certifications 
we have made investments in statistical process controls to improve our overall quality system 
all aspects of the supply chain are integrated into our overall quality system 
our suppliers are evaluated and audited to assure compliance with all international trade compliance quality standards 
relative to our manufacturing processes we maintain and adhere to specific standard operating procedures within our quality systems to ensure compliance with our customers requirements for their products 
our symmetry surgical business likewise operates under a comprehensive quality system to ensure compliance with all product quality and customer obligations 
the suppliers we utilize in the distribution process are evaluated and audited to assure compliance to all international trade compliance quality standards 
we are not aware of any significant quality issues or concerns  although if we experience a breakdown in our quality systems that result in the sale or manufacture of noncompliance products we could incur costs and loss of business  recalls  lawsuits or other adverse results 
regulatory compliance we maintain an effective regulatory program to assure compliance with all applicable us and international regulatory standards and directives with regard to both our manufacturing and symmetry surgical businesses 
our regulatory program focuses primarily on minimizing any risks associated with noncompliance with requirements or standards that could impact our products fit  form and function 
we also place great emphasis on maintaining and following effective auditing practices and procedures to assure compliance with all internal and external standard operating procedures and k process requirements 
finally  we conduct ongoing due diligence to monitor and assure compliance with all country of origin requirements and certifications with regard to international regulatory agencies 
we are not aware of any failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations  although we cannot assure you that the costs of compliance or failure to comply with any obligations would not impact our business negatively 

table of contents competition our oem solutions customers  to varying degrees  are capable of internally developing and producing most of the products we provide 
while we believe that our comprehensive offerings and core production competencies allow medical device companies to reduce costs and shorten time to market by utilizing our services  one or more of our customers may seek to expand their development and manufacturing operations which may reduce their reliance on independent suppliers such as us 
we compete on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  total cost value relationship and on time delivery 
we also compete with independent suppliers of implants  instruments and cases to medical device companies 
a majority of these suppliers are privately owned and produce some  but not all  of the products required in orthopedic implant systems 
we compete with other independent suppliers primarily on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  costs and on time delivery 
we believe that we are the largest independent supplier of implants  instruments and cases to orthopedic device manufacturers 
however  other independent suppliers may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing  manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition that are greater than ours 
we estimate there to be less than ten competitors who can offer implant manufacturing capabilities from forging casting to finishing  less than fifty competitors who can offer complete case manufacturing capabilities and nearly  who compete in instrument or implant machining 
our symmetry surgical business competes with a range of large multi national branded instrument companies including asculap  v 
mueller  and integra as well as hundreds of smaller  independent suppliers of specific instruments located throughout the world 
we compete with our larger competitors on the basis of product quality  breadth of product offering  reputation for sourcing from quality manufacturers  clinically trained sales force  training education  product performance  value cost relationship  product availability  innovation  and responsiveness to tender opportunities and other customer needs 
we compete with the smaller independent competitors on the basis of breadth of product offering  clinically trained sales force  training education  product quality  product performance  value cost relationship  product availability  innovation  and responsiveness to tender opportunities and other customer needs 
independent providers may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing  manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition that are greater than ours 
intellectual property we believe our patents are valuable  however  our knowledge  experience  proprietary and trade secret information  manufacturing processes  product design and development staff and sales staff have been equally or more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we seek to protect our non patented know how  trade secrets  processes and other proprietary confidential information principally through confidentiality  non compete and invention assignment agreements 
our research development team manages our intellectual property across both our oem solutions and symmetry surgical businesses 
some patents held by our oem solutions segment are for products sold by symmetry surgical 
for those symmetry surgical products not manufactured by oem solutions  symmetry surgical is the patent holder 
we currently own total issued patents and have patents pending related to our cases and instruments 
with the acquisition of the surgical instrument portfolio from codman  we added ten issued patents related to our cases and instruments 
these patents expire at various times beginning in and ending in we also have issued trademarks and twelve pending trademarks 
with the acquisition of the surgical instrument portfolio from codman  we added issued trademarks 
our policy is to protect technology  inventions and improvements that we consider important through the use of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets in the united states and significant foreign markets 
if our products were found to infringe any proprietary right of a third party  we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees to the third party or cease production  marketing and distribution of those products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information we own and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 

table of contents employees as of march  we had  employees 
our employees are not represented by any unions 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees 
government regulation our business is subject to governmental regulation 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the emission  discharge  use  storage and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of these materials at our facilities and at off site disposal locations 
we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws currently applicable to our business and we are not subject to any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any company facility or any off site location 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to such environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations 
as a component manufacturer  our medical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
the fda and related state and foreign governmental agencies regulate many of our customers products as medical devices 
in many cases  the fda must approve those products prior to commercialization 
we believe that our existing medical manufacturing plants comply with current good manufacturing practices as applicable 
we have master files on record with the fda 
master files may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities  processes or articles used in the manufacturing  processing  packaging and storing of one or more medical device components 
these submissions may be used by device manufacturers to support the premarket notification process required by section k of the federal food drug cosmetic act 
this notification process is necessary to obtain clearance from the fda to market a device for human use in the united states 
we are also subject to various other environmental  transportation and labor laws as well as various other directives and regulations both in the us and abroad 
we believe that compliance with these laws will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
given the scope and nature of these laws  however  there can be no assurance that they will not have a material impact on our results of operations

item a 
risk factors our profitability is subject to risks described under this section addressing risk factors 
although the following are not necessarily the only risks our company faces  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of any or all of them 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on sales to our five largest oem customers  and our business could be adversely affected if any of them reduced or terminated purchases from us 
a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers  all of whom are our customers  control the predominant share of the orthopedic device market 
we depend heavily on revenue from the top five companies in the orthopedic industry 
revenue from our ten largest customers represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year and of our revenue in fiscal year our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year and in fiscal we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
our sales may be impacted by significant changes in these customers market share  cyclicality  inventory reductions  capital budget investment in instruments and cases  unpredictability of their new product launch activity  changes in their supply chain management  as well as the impact the global economy has on these customers buying patterns 
customer or competitor consolidation could adversely affect demand and pricing  which could adversely affect our business 
many healthcare companies are consolidating to create new companies that possess greater market power 
as the healthcare industry continues to consolidate  our customers may delay purchases or new product launches as they integrate operations and products 
customer consolidation may also impact demand for our 
table of contents products  as the consolidated company implements its supply chain management philosophy 
competitor consolidation may also increase pressure as a result of the resulting larger company s greater product and services offerings 
consolidation of our customers or competitors may increase pricing pressure or reduce our revenue  either of which would impact our operating results 
loss of a large group purchasing organization contract  a proprietary hospital system contract  or a country specific international distributor could adversely affect symmetry surgical s revenue and could adversely affect our business 
we maintain positive relations with several group purchasing organizations and large proprietary hospital systems 
as these organizations continue to pursue cost reduction opportunities  they may demand contractual concessions which we are not willing to accept 
additionally  outside the us  we sell through country specific distributors who may also demand contractual concessions which may be undesirable for us in that market 
while we believe we could pursue other distributors in global markets and engage gpo or hospital system hospitals directly  the loss of their contracts would impede our ability to generate demand and revenue and could adversely affect sales and profitability 
if we are unable to continue to improve our current products and develop new products  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete 
we sell our products to customers in markets that are characterized by technological change  product innovation and evolving industry standards 
we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  both in collaboration with our customers and independently 
our customers may engage in additional in house development and manufacturing  and if the product advances we make are not sufficient for their needs  they may instead rely on internal capabilities 
in addition  our independent competitors may produce products that are more appealing to our customers and thereby impair our ability to compete effectively with them 
our competitors product development capabilities could also become more effective than ours  and their new products may get to market before our products  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
increased regulatory pressures and longer approval processes may impair our ability to develop and assist our customers in developing innovative products  as well as our ability to do so on a commercially effective timeline 
if one or more of these events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
further  in recent years we have increased our investment in new product development and there is a risk that we may not realize the financial returns expected from that investment  which could also adverse impact our business 
we face competition from our customers in house capabilities  established independent suppliers and potential new market entrants  and if we lose customers it would have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results as many of our global facilities would be underutilized 
our largest customers have varying degrees of development and manufacturing capabilities  and one or more of them may seek to expand their in house capabilities in the future  including adding capacity in existing sites or expanding into low labor cost areas such as asia 
many of our customers are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we do and can commit significant resources to product development and manufacturing 
many of our independent competitors are smaller companies  many of which have close customer relationships and either a low cost structure or highly specialized design or production capabilities 
our independent competitors may continue to consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities or brand recognition that are greater than ours 
in addition  the innovative nature of our markets may attract new entrants to the field 
our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products developed  manufactured or sold by other companies  which could result in the loss of customers and  as a result  decreased revenue and operating results 
because we have multiple global facilities with associated fixed overhead  our profits vary widely depending on volume 
if we were to lose customers and or key volumes  it could significantly impact our profits 

table of contents if product liability lawsuits are brought against us or our customers our business may be harmed 
the manufacture and sale of our healthcare and other products  including our aerospace products  expose us to potential product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design or manufacturing flaws in  our products  or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or otherwise require us to pay significant damages  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
the product liability insurance that we carry is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to protect us against product liability claims 
further  significant litigation or adverse awards could render us unable to maintain this insurance at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms  if at all 
we rely on our independent sales distributors and sales representatives to market and sell our products 
our success depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales representatives  in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace 
independent distributors and sales representatives may terminate their relationships with us or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent distributors  and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to maintain our existing relationships with our independent distributors and sales representatives could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced turnover with some of our independent sales distributors in the past  which adversely affected short term financial results while we transitioned to new independent sales distributors 
while we believe these transitions have been managed effectively  similar occurrences could happen in the future with different results which could have a greater adverse effect on our operations than we have previously experienced 
we are subject to complex and costly regulation 
our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other national  federal and state governmental authorities 
it can be costly and time consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and or approval to market medical products 
clearance and or approval might not be granted for a new or modified device or other product on a timely basis  if at all 
regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative  administrative or judicial action  which may further increase our costs or reduce sales 
unless an exception applies  the fda requires that the manufacturer of new medical products or a new indication for use of  or other significant change in  an existing medical device obtain either k pre market notification clearance or pre market approval before those products can be marketed or sold in the united states 
modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the product  technology  materials  labeling  packaging  or manufacturing process may also require a new k clearance 
the fda has proposed changes to its k pre market clearance process and although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives  it appears that the time and cost to get many of our medical devices to market could increase significantly 
this could impact both our oem solutions customers as well as symmetry surgical products 
in addition  we are subject to regulations covering manufacturing practices  product labeling and advertising  and adverse event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product 
our failure to maintain clearances or approvals for existing products  to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products  or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing  labeling  advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
further  if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications  published standards or regulatory requirements  we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
many of our facilities and procedures  and those of our suppliers  are subject to ongoing oversight  including periodic inspection by governmental authorities 
compliance with production  safety  quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time consuming 
the sales and marketing of medical products is coming under increased scrutiny by the fda and other regulatory agencies and enforcement bodies 
if our sales and marketing activities fail to comply with fda 
table of contents regulations or guidelines  or other applicable laws  we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions from the fda or other enforcement bodies 
any claims in excess of our insurance coverage limits may result in substantial costs and a reduction in its available capital resources 
we maintains property insurance policies covering physical damage to its equipment  facilities  buildings and inventory  employer s liability insurance generally covering death or work injury of employees  product liability insurance covering product liability claims arising from the use  consumption or operation of its products  general liability insurance covering certain incidents to third parties that occur on or in the premises of the corporation  business interruption insurance  and directors and officers liability insurance  among others 
our insurance coverage  however  may not be sufficient to cover all claims 
as we expand our symmetry surgical sales efforts in to multiple international countries it may increase the risk of claims 
our symmetry surgical sales efforts may be impaired by consolidation of customers or an inability to compete with regard to pricing or products 
our symmetry surgical segment s direct sales success relies upon its ability to provide products to customers on competitive price  delivery and quantity terms 
some of our customers utilize a single or small group of suppliers  and some producers utilize a small or limited group of distributors 
if consolidation in the hospital industry continues we may lose customers that are absorbed into larger hospital companies that work with a limited number of competitive suppliers 
in addition  our competitors may provide products similar to ours on a more price competitive basis  or we may find that we are unable to secure necessary products on a price or quantity basis required by our customers 
further  we may be unable to secure distribution rights for products required by our customers  causing them to consolidate their purchasing with competitors who are able to provide such products 
finally  some of the manufacturers for whom we provide distribution services might decide to sell directly to customers  bypassing our distribution services 
if any of these events should occur  it would impair our direct sales business and cause a decline in revenue and profit 
our operating results are subject to significant potential fluctuation and historical results should not be relied on as an indication of our future results 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year in the future due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the timing of significant orders and shipments  including the effects of changes in inventory management practices by our customers  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us  our customers and our competitors  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in medical treatment or regulatory practices  delays caused by the regulatory approval process for our new products  restrictions and delays caused by regulatory review of our customers products  our ability to meet customer demand for certain products or types of products  the utilization of our manufacturing assets  significantly changing quality and regulatory requirements from the fda and our customers  recalls of our or our customers products  and availability and cost of raw materials 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in 
table of contents future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
if we do not retain key individuals and retain and attract skilled manufacturing workers and sales representatives  we may not be able to operate successfully  and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends in part upon the retention of key managerial  sales and technical personnel  and skilled manufacturing workers 
we compete for such personnel with other companies and organizations  many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we do 
many of these competitors are located in the same limited geographic areas in which our current operations are located 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers  senior management or other key personnel 
in our industry  skilled manufacturing workers are difficult to identify and hire because we compete with numerous precision manufacturing companies to attract and retain qualified and highly skilled manufacturing employees 
our northeast indiana and massachusetts facilities  in particular  face significant and increasing competition  including from certain of our customers and other companies  such as orthopedic related start up companies located in or near warsaw  indiana or in massachusetts 
some of these competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if we are not able to retain and attract skilled manufacturing employees  we may be unable to support our anticipated growth  which could adversely affect our profitability 
in  we significantly expanded our direct sales force with the addition of the codman surgical instruments business and are engaged in a detailed integration process under which we are incorporating that business into our symmetry surgical business 
our competitors may try to recruit our key symmetry surgical employees during the period of transition or thereafter  or certain key employees may elect to leave the corporation 
the loss of key symmetry surgical employees could impair our ability to successfully integrate and operate the symmetry surgical business  resulting in loss of sales and profit 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could make our products obsolete or less attractive 
the development of new technologies could reduce or shift demand for our products 
for example  pharmaceutical advances could result in non surgical treatments gaining more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopedic implants 
the emergence of successful new biological tissue based or synthetic materials to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged tissue could minimize or delay the need for implant surgery and provide other biological alternatives to orthopedic implants 
new surgical procedures could diminish demand for our instruments or implants 
new sterilization methods could also limit the demand for our sterilization cases 
any of these or other shifts in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could adversely affect demand for our products 
in recent years we have seen a trend to more customer specific implants which require less instrument sets and if this trend were to increase  it may reduce the demand for our reusable instruments 
we have also seen a trend to try and replace reusable instruments  which we largely make  with disposable instruments  which we do source on a limited basis 
if this trend gains significant momentum  we would have to retool our facilities to support this demand 
we have also seen several large manufacturers begin reprocessing of single use devices for resale despite single use labeling 
if this trend gains momentum  it could place pricing pressure on some symmetry surgical instrument products 

table of contents we depend on third party suppliers  and in some cases a single third party supplier  for key components and raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and the loss of these sources could harm our business 
we use plastic  titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other raw materials in our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases from a single supplier 
further  some of our raw materials are produced in areas of the world that are subject to political and other disruptions that could impair supply 
any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be found 
further  our efforts to cover such materials could be costly and impair our ability to meet our contractual obligations for certain products on a profitable basis 
we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
this could interrupt our business  cause us to become involved in litigation with suppliers or customers  impair our profitability and or reduce the quality of our products 
in addition  changes in suppliers may require customer approval  which could delay the production and sale of the products we manufacture 
in our symmetry surgical segment  we have several products which are sourced from a single manufacturer 
if that manufacturer experiences issues with its ability to supply the product we require  raises the price of that product  or otherwise impairs our ability to obtain the product  it would reduce our sales and delay or prevent products from reaching our customers 
additionally  certain provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may soon require us to report on conflict minerals used in our products and the due diligence plan we put in place to track whether such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in certain of our products 
our current and future levels of indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business  finance acquisitions and pursue new business strategies 
as of december   our total indebtedness  including short term revolving lines of credit  short term senior secured debt  long term senior secured debt  subordinated debt and capital lease obligations was million and we had million of our million revolving credit facility remaining available 
our revolving credit facility  maturing in november  our bank term loans  maturing in december  and our senior subordinated term notes  maturing in december  all contain covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
in december  we used a substantial amount of debt to finance the acquisition of the codman surgical instruments business for million 
the codman acquisition was almost entirely financed through the use of debt  including approximately million of our line of credit  the addition of million in bank term loans  plus million in senior subordinated debt 
in the future we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  business opportunities  capital expenditures or other capital requirements 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions  make it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements  and make it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and collaborations 
our ability to service our recently increased level of indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors  
table of contents including but not limited to all of the factors and risks discussed herein 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that  based upon current levels of operations  we will be able to meet our debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among others  that we will continue to be successful in implementing our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments  we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
we cannot be certain that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments 
to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future  the risks associated with our indebtedness described above  including our possible inability to service our debt  would increase 
given our recent acquisition and increased debt levels and covenants  this risk factor is more significant than in prior periods and years 
failure to satisfy the obligations and maintain compliance with our lending agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
each of our lending arrangements requires timely payments of interest and our bank term loan requires quarterly principal payments commencing september additionally  both lending arrangements include various restrictive covenants where compliance is essential for credit availability 
we may be unable to comply with the financial ratios or covenants and  if we fail to do so  we may be unable to obtain waivers from our lenders 
failure to comply with any payment or compliance requirements of our debt would entitle the lenders to  among other things  accelerate the maturity or terminate the availability of credit commitments 
our lending agreements contain restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our lending agreements contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
our lending agreements also contain covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness  invest in our foreign operations  acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures  and impose various other restrictions 
these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to revenue generated by sales of our products  expenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products  costs of developing new products or technologies  costs associated with capital expenditures  costs associated with our expansion  costs associated with regulatory compliance  including maintaining compliance with the quality system regulations imposed by the fda  the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  working capital requirements related to growing new acquisitions or existing business  expansion of our international or domestic facilities  and costs of litigation  awards or other legal issues that arise 
as a result of these factors  we may need to raise additional funds  and these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional 
table of contents funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  execute our business strategy  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements 
we may not realize all of the sales expected from new product development programs 
we incur substantial expenses in developing and testing new products and related devices 
these expenses have continued to increase over recent years 
our realization of additional revenue from new product development efforts is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including  directly or indirectly  end user acceptance of the product  reimbursement approval by third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers and  in some cases  fda or comparable foreign regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  our customers typically have no contractual requirement to purchase from us the products that we develop  and they could seek to have another supplier or in house facility manufacture products that we have developed or substitutes for them 
we also incur costs and make capital expenditures for new product development and production based upon certain estimates of production volumes for our existing and anticipated products 
if the actual demand for our products is less than planned  our revenue and net income may decline 
our earnings would be negatively impacted if we write off goodwill or intangible assets created as a result of our various acquisitions 
as a result of acquisitions  including the two acquisitions completed in  we have accumulated a substantial amount of goodwill  amounting to million as of december   or approximately of our total assets as of such date 
goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment by us annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances develop that would likely result in impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate  an adverse regulatory action  unanticipated competition or financial restatements 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights  or are subject to intellectual property claims by third parties  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement  misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  if at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive advantages 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and customers 
we cannot confirm  however  that these agreements will not be breached  these agreements will be enforced by a court or other judicial body  we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
in addition  third parties may claim that we are infringing  misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights 
we could be found to infringe those intellectual property rights  which could affect our ability 
table of contents to manufacture any affected product 
in addition  any protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could drain our financial resources  divert the time and effort of our management and cause customers to delay or limit their purchases of the affected product until resolution of the litigation 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so 
in  we completed two acquisitions  both of which contain significant intellectual property  proprietary products  trademarks and license agreements 
the loss of rights to any of these assets could impair the value of these acquisitions 
we are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have significant international operations and we continue to expand and grow these operations 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  ireland and malaysia 
with the acquisition of codman surgical instruments  we have added operations in germany and sales into over countries 
certain risks are inherent in international operations that could have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations or profitability  including  but not limited to difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of our products reside  difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  changes in governmental approaches to foreign industry  changes in tax  training or other incentives upon which we relied or rely in deciding to do business in a particular country  wars  insurrections or other strife  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  compliance obligations under a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and compliance with international laws and regulations  including but not limited to  the us foreign corrupt practices act by our distributors in global markets 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 

table of contents efforts to acquire additional companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations  and if we complete additional acquisitions  we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems 
in the past six years  we have completed eight acquisitions 
in we completed two acquisitions 
in august we acquired olsen medical for million and in december we acquired the assets of codman surgical instruments for million 
in we will be focused on the integration of these two acquisitions 
in the future  we may seek to acquire additional businesses or product lines for various reasons  including providing new product manufacturing capabilities  adding new customers  increasing penetration with existing customers or expanding into new geographic markets 
our ability to successfully grow through additional acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings 
these additional efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and integration of our recently completed acquisitions 
if we complete additional acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer reaction to the business combination 
additional acquisitions could also materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt and acquisition expenses or requiring us to amortize acquired assets 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial results 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
we have operations in the united kingdom  france  ireland  malaysia and germany 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs incurred in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in we did not hedge our exposure  however  with the addition of the codman surgical instruments acquisition we may need to hedge this exposure in or in the future as we will now increase our annual purchases payable in euros by approximately million 
we may be adversely affected as a result of the long lead times required for sales of certain new products  including our customer launches 
we often compete for business at the beginning of the development cycle of new medical devices or upon customer redesign of existing medical devices 
our customers generally must obtain clearance or approval from the fda before commercially distributing their products 
unless exempt  a new medical device must be approved for commercial distribution in the united states by the fda through the k pre market notification process or  in some cases  through the more burdensome pre market approval  or pma  process 
in recent years it has taken three to nine months from the date of submission to the fda to obtain k clearance and one to three years from the date of submission to the fda to obtain approval through the pma process  but in each case the approval may take significantly longer 
this results in long lead times for some of our customers new products  which may make it difficult in the short term for us to obtain sales of new products to increase revenue or replace any unexpected decline in sales of existing products 

table of contents we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages  other labor matters  or new labor laws 
currently  none of our us facilities are unionized 
however  over the last years  our employees at two of our locations have attempted to unionize 
in addition  some of our orthopedic device customers have unionized work forces 
while we have not experienced any adverse effects from work stoppages or slow downs at our customers or suppliers facilities  work stoppages or slow downs experienced by us  our suppliers or our customers or their suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of facilities where our products are made or used 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter strikes  further unionization efforts  new labor laws  or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
with the addition of the codman surgical instrument acquisition we now have a german facility which may present new risks related to labor relations 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes one or more of our manufacturing and distribution facilities or information technology infrastructure  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
we have seventeen manufacturing and distribution facilities located in the us  united kingdom  france  ireland  malaysia and germany 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment and personnel know how that we use to produce and distribute our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event that one or more of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to attempt to shift production to our other manufacturing facilities or rely on third party manufacturers  and our other facilities or a third party manufacturer may not have the capability to effectively supply the affected products 
our symmetry surgical business provides global distribution from our nashville  tn headquarters 
should a disaster strike this facility  we would be forced to attempt to shift distribution to another facility in the us or europe and adversely affect our ability to ship and invoice product 
disruptions to the global transportation network could also affect our ability to ship and invoice product 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
the prolonged period of us financial difficulties over the past several years and uncertainty in global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
over the last several years  the us and other countries around the world have experienced deteriorating and uncertain economic conditions  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
if this trend in economic conditions does not continue to improve or reverts to further deterioration  it could lead to delayed or decreased demand for our product 
it may additionally adversely affect our customers access to capital  willingness to spend capital on our products  or ability to pay for products they will order or have already ordered from us 
it could also impair our access to markets  capital on favorable terms  access to raw materials  and other difficulties 
furthermore  if our suppliers face challenges in selling their products or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the key components and raw materials needed in our manufacturing processes 
the foregoing may impact our business  accuracy of our forecasts  profitability and have other adverse impacts on our results 
patients delaying elective orthopedic surgeries have resulted in slowing procedural growth rates  predominantly in hip and knee surgery 
as a result  in recent years our customers growth has slowed compared to historical levels and they have delayed or reduced their product launch volumes  with the resulting reduction in our business 
we may experience difficulties  delays  performance impact or unexpected costs from consolidation of facilities 
during and  we consolidated two us case manufacturing facilities into one 
this consolidation resulted in higher costs and delayed deliveries during in the future  we may be required to further consolidate our operations in order to improve our cost structure  achieve increased operating efficiencies  and improve our competitive standing or results of operations and or to address unfavorable economic conditions 
we may also lose favorable tax incentives or not be able to renew a lease on acceptable terms  resulting in the need to consolidate 
as part of these actions  we may further reduce staff  make 
table of contents changes to certain capital projects  close certain production operations and abandon leases for certain facilities that will not be used in our operations 
in conjunction with any actions  we will continue to make significant investments and build the framework for our future growth 
we may not realize  in full or in part  all of the anticipated benefits and savings from these efforts due to unforeseen difficulties  delays or unexpected costs 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain all of the resulting savings or benefits to our business or other unforeseen events occur  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
as a result of the global economic downturn  we have worked and will continue to work to increase cost efficiencies and to reduce discretionary expenditures  and in the event the economy does not continue to recover  or if it further deteriorates  we may also be required to consider further steps to improve our cost structure 
additionally  the anticipated benefits of our cost reduction initiatives are based on forecasts which could vary substantially from actual results  and we cannot provide assurance that any such cost saving initiatives will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
significant changes to us federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations that apply to our operations and activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
our operations are subject to the tax laws  regulations and administrative practices of the us  us state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business 
significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
for example  our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
substantial reform of us tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  the impact of the us medical device tax directly on our company or through our oem customers could have a material impact on our financial results 
risks related to our industry orthopedic device manufacturers have significant leverage over their independent suppliers and consolidation could increase their leverage  which could result in the loss of customers or force us to reduce our prices 
we compete with many manufacturers to develop and supply implants  surgical instruments and cases to a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers 
as a result  orthopedic device manufacturers have historically had significant leverage over their independent suppliers 
for example  independent suppliers like us are subject to continuing pressure from the major orthopedic device manufacturers to reduce the cost of products while maintaining quality levels 
in the past  the medical device industry has experienced substantial consolidation 
if the medical device industry  and the orthopedic device industry in particular  continue to consolidate  competition to provide products to orthopedic device manufacturers may become more intense 
orthopedic device manufacturers may seek to use their market power to negotiate price or other concessions for our products 
if we are forced to reduce prices or if we lose customers because of competition  our revenue and results of operations would suffer 
in recent years  the industry has experienced a lack of demand and competition has become more aggressive trying to win orders and fill their facilities 
our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment measures and other industry trends affecting pricing that could result in reduced sales of or prices for our products 
acceptance of our customers products by hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians depend on  among other things  reimbursement approval of third party payers such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers 
the continuing efforts of government  insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to lower reimbursement rates or non reimbursement for medical procedures that use our products 
as that occurs  medical device manufacturers might insist that we lower prices on products related to the affected medical device or they might significantly reduce or eliminate their purchases from us of these related products  which could affect our profitability 

table of contents we and our customers are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop  manufacture and price our products 
the medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
some of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations  including current good manufacturing practices and quality system requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging and shipping of our products 
further  some of our facilities  records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the fda or other agencies 
failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  repairs  replacements  refunds  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusal of the fda or other regulatory agencies to grant future pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition  orthopedic implants and other medical devices produced by our customers are subject to intensive regulation and potential pre approval requirements by the fda and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
recently  the fda has imposed more significant requirements on supplier control procedures that may require additional audits  process validations and potentially increased costs to get products to market 
compliance with these regulations may be time consuming  burdensome and expensive for our customers and  indirectly  for us  to the extent that our customers compliance depends on our operations 
these regulations could negatively affect our customers abilities to sell their products  which in turn would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
this may result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
the regulations to which we and our customers are subject are complex  change frequently and have become more stringent over time 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state levels 
recently  the fda has proposed a substantial k reform amendment that could change significantly the requirements and review process 
the fda may also review all current and past k s to assure they are compliant with current regulatory requirements 
in addition  these regulations may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations  higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
if our customers fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals to commercially distribute our future products our ability to sell our products could suffer 
some of our products are subject to rigorous regulatory pre approval by the fda and other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
our customers are typically responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products 
the process of obtaining this approval  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda  for example  assigns medical devices to one of three classes which determine  among other things  the type and degree of fda approval required to commercially distribute the device in the united states 
we produce class i  ii and iii devices 
class i devices are deemed to present little risk to patients and are generally exempt from fda approval requirements 
class ii devices can generally be commercially distributed only after the device has received k clearance 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if certain design  testing and validation requirements are met and it is demonstrated that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may   or to another commercially available device subsequently cleared through the k pre market notification process 
this process generally takes three to six months  but recently has taken substantially longer  up to nine months or 
table of contents more  due to increased review time and scrutiny of requirements to assure a more safe and effective product 
before a class iii device can be commercially distributed in the united states  a pre market approval  or pma  must be obtained from the fda 
the pma process can be expensive and uncertain  requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
the commercial distribution of any products we develop that require regulatory clearance may be delayed 
in addition  because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product enhancements we develop for commercial distribution in the united states will be exempt from the fda market clearance requirements or subject to the shorter k clearance process  the regulatory approval process for our products or product enhancements may take significantly longer than anticipated by us or our customers 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could incur fines  penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws 
in addition  we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
such costs could be material 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur material liabilities as a result of any contamination or injury 
the impact of the recently enacted federal healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain 
in march  the united states congress adopted and president obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation through the passage of the patient protection and affordable health care act hr and the health care and education reconciliation act hr 
to help offset the cost of the healthcare reforms provided therein  the legislation imposes a excise tax on all domestic sales of medical devices after december  with the addition of the excise tax to the ordinary income tax already payable by medical device manufactures  the medical device industry will bear one of the highest average income tax rates imposed on any industry in the world 
we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate effect the federal health care reform will have on us 
many of the details of the new federal legislation have not yet been finalized or are slated for implementation in the future

changing laws  regulations and standards  including those relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and recently enacted sec regulations  have created additional compliance requirements for companies such as ours 
our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are like to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management s time from other business activities

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview introduction healthcare is a trillion global industry which is expected to continue to grow as the population ages  standards of care in developing nations evolve  and advances in medical care are achieved 
representing one of the largest percentages of gdp  cost containment in healthcare is becoming an increasingly critical issue in both government funded and privately insured populations 
nonetheless  there is an expectation of continued improvements in the standard of care and prevention 
the global medical device market is estimated to be over billion  with annual growth anticipated in the low to mid single digits 
we compete primarily in two segments of the medical device market orthopedic products and reusable general surgical instruments 
symmetry medical oem solutions in  we estimate revenues generated by sales of orthopedic products worldwide exceeded billion of the global medical device market  an increase of over global revenues 
of the billion  of those revenues come from the ten largest orthopedic companies in the world 
reconstructive products implants used to replace knees  hips  shoulders  and other joints represent the largest segment of oem sales at followed by spine and trauma products which repair bone fractures at and  respectively 
the market is global in nature with growth in the us estimated to be zero to slightly negative in and growth outside of the us ous to be slightly positive for a net worldwide flat market 
long term procedural growth rates in orthopedics are estimated to be four to seven percent with spinal growth slightly faster and trauma slightly slower  however  pricing pressure on oem companies offset by mix and product introductions may result in a more variable revenue projection 
in  global sales of reconstructive joint replacement products hips  knees  shoulders  elbows  wrists  digits exceeded billion  virtually flat versus the previous year 
knees comprised the largest sub segment of the joint replacement market at billion followed by hips at billion 
geographically  sales in the us accounted for slightly more than of global joint replacement revenue 
in  sales of products excluding biologics used in spinal procedures including fusion  discectomy  disc replacement  vertebroplasty kyphoplasty  and fracture repair are estimated to have exceeded billion 
the seven largest oem global spine companies controlled of the worldwide spine market in it is believed that procedural growth rates were slowed as a result of macro economic issues government funding and gdp growth as well as unemployment risk of unemployment and access to insurance 
nonetheless  we expect continued growth in the orthopedic device market to be driven by a number of trends including growing elderly population  aging  affluent and active baby boomers placing additional wear and tear on their joints  obesity trends significantly increasing risk of osteoarthritis and subsequent joint replacements  improving technologies that expand the market  including minimally invasive surgery  
table of contents successful clinical outcomes increasing patient confidence  increasing patient awareness through orthopedic device companies direct marketing programs  increasing volume of procedures to replace older implants or revision procedures  and developing international markets 
the contract manufacturing industry  in which our oem solutions business competes  serves the orthopedic oem companies by providing engineering  manufacturing  and distribution services in the areas of implants  surgical instruments used to implant the prosthesis  and cases used to carry and sterilize instruments implants 
because of the lack of availability of data regarding oem self manufacturing and the number of privately held competitors  internal estimates for the size of the contract manufacturing industry range from billion to billion in we expect that this will grow at a rate faster than procedural growth and consolidate among fewer larger competitors as a result of oem customers are forced to make choices of where to apply limited resources in product development and manufacturing resulting in a greater use of contract manufacturers  new oem entrants capitalizing on the expertise and scale afforded by contract manufacturers  oem customers selecting technologies which are considered core competencies and choosing to outsource others  medical device oems are under pressure to comply with increased regulation by the fda of firms who manufacture  repackage  relabel  and or import medical devices sold in the us  oem customers continue to consolidate their supplier base in an effort to streamline their supply chain and concentrate relationships with more sophisticated suppliers  and significant switching cost to change suppliers contract manufacturers given complexity of products as well as long standing relationships 
symmetry s oem solutions business competes in the contract manufacturing industry serving the orthopedic oem marketplace and to a lesser degree adjacent medical device segments including arthroscopy  dental  laparoscopy  osteobilogic  and endoscopy segments predominantly through our cases and trays product lines 
we also offer services to specialized non healthcare markets such as aerospace where our precision machining capacity can bring value 
we manufacture most of the products we sell and have manufacturing locations worldwide to service our global customer base 
we believe that our comprehensive product and services offering  our quality and regulatory expertise  our global resources and our size as the largest provider in the orthopedic industry and range of capabilities provide us a competitive advantage 
we leverage these competitive advantages to accelerate our customers time to market as they develop and launch new products 
this relationship typically leads to an ongoing supply of products to our customers during the life of the product 
our primary products in the oem solutions segment include implants  including forged  cast and machined products for the global orthopedic device market  instruments used in the placement and removal of orthopedic implants and in other surgical procedures  cases  including plastic  metal and hybrid cases used to organize  secure and transport medical devices for orthopedic  endoscopy  dental and other surgical procedures  and other specialized products for the aerospace market 
we believe that our oem solutions segment has created a distinct competitive position in the orthopedic device market based upon our total solutions approach 
our total solutions approach provides our customers with a broad range of products  as well as comprehensive design  engineering and project management services and state of the art production capabilities to help bring their implant systems to market quickly and efficiently 
while definitive market share data is not available  we estimate that our oem solutions business holds approximately overall market share 

table of contents in our oem solutions business  our core strategy is built around our business model which leverages our global resources to expand our leadership position within the orthopedic sector and to diversify our revenue base to related medical markets as an oem supplier 
specific to our orthopedic customers  we believe that we have well established relationships which provide us access to decision makers in product development  sales marketing  engineering  and procurement 
in addition to attempting to gain a greater share of new opportunities from these customers  we believe that trends among our oem customers to consolidate their supply chains will continue to create opportunities for growth faster than market 
the larger oems are increasingly focused on improving their supply chains by outsourcing more of their products among a consolidated group of strategic suppliers who are expected to provide a wider range of services 
these actions are intended to result in an increased level of attention among their suppliers to quality and regulatory compliance  resulting in reduced overall costs for the oem 
the smaller oems are becoming more reliant on their suppliers to support the increased regulatory and quality requirements being placed on their systems  thus utilizing the strong offering of the oem solutions business 
additionally  we believe that growth opportunities exist to provide products that we have developed or modified specifically for our customers particular product lines 
the receptivity of customers to our innovations as well as opportunities for our oem solutions business to grow market share are built upon a foundation of meeting our customers basic expectations for product and process quality as well as customer service in the form of responsive lead times and on time delivery of expected purchase orders 
in the corporation s new senior management team identified that our customer service to oem solutions customers was not meeting the standards our customers expected  and had not for the previous year 
additionally  while our quality system was still assessed among the best in the contract manufacturing industry  we were no longer significantly differentiated in our capabilities 
these two weaknesses in our execution created a competitive disadvantage for the company in gaining new or ongoing opportunities with existing customers and acquiring new customers 
management devoted significant attention and expense throughout to addressing this situation 
actions taken and voluntary departures resulted in the replacement of several senior leaders accountable for manufacturing execution chief operating officer senior vice president cases  senior vice president implants  senior vice president instruments  the recruitment and hiring of business leaders with manufacturing strengths in both medical and non medical environments  the recruitment and hiring of plant general managers at several sites  a significant increase in inventory to improve service levels  and an increase in direct and indirect labor including overtime 
while the financial impact of these actions has been significant  these actions were necessary to begin reversing the negative trend in performance and customer perception 
we have initiated several additional long term programs which we believe will help to reduce costs and lead to improvements in gross margin and a further solidification of our status of having a best in class quality system 
these include the symmetry business system sbs  predictive and outcome metrics  win spc for statistical quality control  etq for quality management  and epicor for a comprehensive erp infrastructure 
in the following critical activities were conducted the first stage of the sbs deployed with the implementation of gemba walks at all facilities and the completion of the sbs roadmap  the identification and daily measurement of critical outcome metrics and select predictive indicators company wide  installation of win spc stations at many symmetry plants and approval of the capital appropriation to complete the rollout for all machining centers by third quarter  the completion of a deployment plan and roadmap for etq  and the implementation of epicor at eight manufacturing sites with all the us instrument plants being in a single instance 
while substantial progress was made during this first year  these programs are expected to roll out over multiple years and their benefits continue to be realized 
we believe that these actions will enable us to continue to remove incremental legacy costs and improve gross margin through a reduction of scrap  increased machine and labor efficiency  better information flow reducing inventory  and reduction in back office administration 
while we will always strive to improve our performance and set the benchmark in our industry  we are pleased at the significant progress we have made in and the confirmatory feedback we have received from our customers 
we believe we are well positioned to pursue market share opportunities as customers increase outsourcing and rationalize their supplier base as well as new programs with existing customers and new customers 

table of contents demand for our oem solutions products weakened throughout while the previously described performance issues contributed to order weakness throughout the year  market factors had an additional impact 
specific to our implant product line  the weakness in overall procedural demand specifically knees and hips  the concentration of our sales to select customers and their resulting market share changes  reductions in inventories by oem customers  customer forecast reductions leading to additional inventory reductions  and customer in sourcing to keep their factories at desirable output levels all contributed to the overall weakness we experienced in implant volume 
our instrument and cases business suffered weakness throughout the year and especially in the second half of as a result of oem customers dramatically reducing their capital spending on instrumentation in the latter half of in the face of declining procedural volumes and financial result cash flow objectives 
this was further compounded by some customers efforts to in source selected manufacturing activities 
while we do not expect to see an immediate rebound in capital spending or procedural growth in the first half of  we believe that the prognosis for long term growth remains as customers make capital investments to drive market share gains and launch new products 
to leverage our position for the expected long term rebound in orthopedic procedures and new product launches  as well as the opportunities created by the rationalization of suppliers by oem customers  we are focused on engaging in more active and positive discussions with our customers to satisfy a greater portion of their product and service needs 
while these strategic changes do not happen overnight  we continue to believe that we are in a favorable position to continue as a supplier of choice for our major customers and increase the volume of work they provide 
we believe our global capacity and competitive strengths will continue to benefit us as the order volume and large project launches continue  particularly within the dynamic and aging us population 
we continue to focus on improved performance and are confident that further improvements can be achieved 
we are reviewing all aspects of our operations to achieve these further improvements and believe the following actions will help position us for sustainable long term profitable growth continuous improvement we are focused on improving competitiveness by becoming more efficient while strengthening our operating processes and internal controls 
our new leadership team is working together to increase efficiency across all functions 
we are focused on improving our manufacturing processes through the use of lean principles and techniques in the symmetry business system 
diversification within the orthopedic sector we will continue to expand our product portfolio and build upon the strength of our presence in the large reconstructive joint market 
orthopedic sector diversification will include spine  trauma  extremities and small joints 
diversification outside of the orthopedic market could include areas where we know the customer  know the regulatory standards that govern products and processes  and know or can manage acquired capabilities the manufacturing processes 
low cost country manufacturing we will continue to take advantage of the low cost country capabilities we have created in malaysia to support cost reduction opportunities in partnership with our customers 
capitalize on new capabilities with the acquisitions of the codman surgical instrument portfolio and the line of electrosurgical products from olsen medical  we can expand the type of products we can offer our oem customers 
additionally  codman included an instrument procurement and quality center located in tuttlingen  germany which can be used to offer purchase for resale services to oem customers who would prefer to not do business with the less than small manufacturers in this important manufacturing center 
partnership we will continue to develop and grow our customer relationships to include more strategic and longer term partnerships 

table of contents intellectual property we plan to continue to expand and develop our intellectual property portfolio  with a focus on both process and product patents 
the development of proprietary symmetry products which we can customize for multiple oem customers creates an opportunity to drive increased revenue as well as improved gross margins 
in we filed for patents  more than during the previous five years combined 
organizational development we continue to build an organization structure that is capable of delivering upon our strategic objectives of oem supplier leadership  diversification  innovation and support business development 
engaged employees we frequently communicate with our employees to assure they have the right tools to do their jobs  are being developed properly and to further discover ways to make their employment more satisfying and fulfilling 
we believe that through engaged employees we build satisfied customers 
from to  we completed five acquisitions focused on enhancing our product offerings and business model in our oem solutions business for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we did not complete any acquisitions in focused on our oem solutions business  but we do believe that the acquisition of olsen medical and codman s line of surgical instruments for a total of million will provide a tangential benefit for oem solutions as described above 
our acquisitions have afforded us the opportunity to offer a comprehensive line of implants  surgical instruments and cases for orthopedic device manufacturers on a global basis  instruments and cases into other medical markets and specialized parts into the aerospace industry 
growth through acquisition is a significant part of our business strategy 
we will continue to seek out acquisitions that bring us capabilities to pursue opportunities as an oem solutions provider in adjacent medical device categories or to further strengthen our implant services offerings 
symmetry surgical the reusable general surgical instruments market includes products common to operating rooms that enable clinicians to expose  grasp  cut  and clamp during surgery 
the products are common to a wide range of surgical procedures including general surgery  neurosurgery  spine  arthroscopy  cardio vascular thoracic  ob gyn  ent  and ophthalmic 
products include table mounted retractors  holders  scissors  clamps  forceps  dissectors  hemostats  speculums  vascular scissors  vascular forceps  needle holders  clamps  rib retractors  curettes  dissectors elevators  nerve hooks  duralhooks  retractors  rongeurs  bone cutting forceps  osteotomes  chisels  gouges  hand held retractors  self retaining retractors  spreaders  storage containers  and general disposables including suction tubes  skin markers  vein strippers  disposable towel clips  and lubricants 
products are sold primarily to the tertiary hospital or environment  although increasingly growth is coming from a migration of site of care to ambulatory surgery centers and physician offices for select procedures 
management estimates that there are four large players in the global market with the balance being in hundreds of regional or specialty smaller companies 
we expect that market growth will be driven by the following factors macro economics and demographics driving overall hospital procedural growth  capital investment in new hospital and or new or construction  especially in developing countries  customer cost pressures increasing the use of reusable surgical instruments versus disposable  and innovations that result in a reduction of labor required during surgery  decreased or times  or other reductions in cost to serve 
symmetry surgical previously known as hospital direct business or ssi competes in the reusable general surgical instruments segment of the medical device industry 
historically we have been a small competitor through our specialty surgical instrumentation ssi subsidiary a acquisition with nearly all sales in the us and a concentration in the southern half of the country 
we offered a range of general instrumentation  cases  and other general disposables manufactured by plants within symmetry s oem solutions plants as well as procured from smaller contract manufacturers and other smaller oems 
we believe that our well established customer relationships based on total value  responsiveness  and training with 
table of contents group purchasing organizations as well as hospital materials management  or directors  and clinicians has enabled us to grow faster than market since we acquired ssi 
in we sold in the us through a combination of direct sales representatives and authorized distributors in specific geographies 
with an insignificant amount of overall market share and virtually no sales outside the us  we have been a competitive force outside of the growing number of specific territories where our value proposition has been appreciated by customers 
during  symmetry surgical underwent significant change 
despite slower procedural volumes  symmetry surgical continued to grow faster than market in surgical instrument sales 
our focus throughout the year was the pursuit of market share building upon the opportunities afforded to us through group purchasing organization contracts as well as the total value of our products and responsive service 
we worked collaboratively with our distributor representatives to drive growth as well as through our direct sales force which was primarily located in the southern united states 
we launched new products during the ultra vision retractor system  access elbow loc arm positioner  pure life traditional allograft  ultra lap electrode  and ultra vertebral prep system 
overall  we believe we strengthened the corporation s competitive position in with our service levels  responsive execution  and growing product line 
after acquiring ssi in we did not execute any additional symmetrical surgical acquisitions until august   when we acquired olsen medical  a privately held  world leader in the design  development and manufacturing of electrosurgical instruments and accessories for million in cash 
olsen medical manufactures a full line of single use and reusable bipolar and monopolar forceps  cords  electrosurgical pens pencils  electrodes  and accessories 
olsen medical s products were primarily sold through distributors in the us and internationally  including ssi 
with the olsen medical acquisition we gained an instrument finishing and packaging operation in louisville  ky as well as a sourcing supply chain into asia 
we began the integration of the olsen distributor network in those areas where we did not previously carry the product in and will continue that effort in we also began the integration of the supply chain and all back office services into our nashville  tn headquarters 
on december  the corporation acquired the surgical instruments product portfolio from codman shurtleff  inc  a johnson johnson company  for million in cash 
this transaction included us based personnel in sales  marketing  and r d as well as inventory  intellectual property  trademarks  regulatory approvals  and an instrument procurement center and personnel located in tuttlingen  germany 
as part of the transaction  codman shurtleff  inc will also provide symmetry surgical with transition services for a period of time  including us distribution  global quality and regulatory  and distribution through codman affiliates outside the us this acquisition provides several strategic benefits for our overall business  including increased revenue diversification  enhanced gross margin  a strategic instruments procurement capability in tuttlingen  germany  a strengthened intellectual property portfolio  and innovation driven by access to broader hospital market intelligence in additional surgical specialties 
specific to symmetry surgical  our resulting offering will be one of the broadest and most respected product portfolios in the market for general surgical instruments 
this positions us well to continue growing our us market share in the hospital direct business  as well as building on the strong international presence in countries 
throughout we will fully integrate our sales teams as well as servicing the acquired products and teammates into headquarters in nashville  tn for administrative services as well as customer service  distribution  and western hemisphere sourcing 
the acquired tuttlingen  germany facility will provide sourcing and quality services for products procured in germany  as well as other regions of the world for all of symmetry 
our us based marketing team will collaborate with symmetry engineers and product developers to create a product pipeline that addresses unmet needs for the product areas in which we compete 
while we will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates for symmetry surgical  we are conscious not to enter into product categories which could be considered competitive to our core oem solutions customers 
while growth through acquisition will continue to be a part of our business strategy  we will focus our resources on execution of these acquisitions  innovation of new products  and market share gains to drive growth domestically and abroad 
during fiscal  the combination of our two reportable segments sold products to approximately  customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and 
table of contents in fiscal our five largest customers collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
within each of our largest customers  we typically serve several product teams and facilities  which reduces our reliance on any single purchasing decision

oem solution implant revenue decreased million in fiscal primarily from our five largest oem customers as they reacted to the overall sluggishness of orthopedic procedures and customer days of inventory reduction 
this reduction was offset by favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
oem solution case revenues increased million in fiscal as compared to primarily as a result of favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
oem solution other product revenue increased million  attributable to million increased aerospace customer requirements as their industry experienced higher volumes  and favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of million 
the million increase in symmetry surgical revenue in fiscal as compared to was primarily the result of increased product sales of million as we continued to broaden our product offerings and increase our territory with additional direct sales representation 
revenue also grew from the acquisition of olsen on august  which added million of revenue 
the acquisition of the codman surgical instruments business  completed on december   had no impact on revenue for gross profit

for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are normally based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within a short time 
we enter into blank orders with vendors that have preferred pricing terms  however  these orders are normally cancelable by us without penalty 
amounts predominantly represent purchase agreements to buy minimum quantities of plastic  cobalt chrome and titanium through july this table does not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million as reasonable estimates could not be made regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements include our operating leases and letters of credit  which are available under the amended credit agreement 
we had two letters of credit outstanding as of december  in the amounts of million and million 
the million letter of credit was increased to million on january  environmental our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes  the cleanup of contamination  and the health and safety of our employees 
under such laws and regulations  we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
we could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 

table of contents we incurred approximately million in capital expenditures for environmental  health and safety in both and during  purchases focused on safety and environmental 
projects included wet dust collection systems and safety improvements related to locks  guards and enclosures for certain machinery and equipment 
in connection with past acquisitions  we completed phase i environmental assessments and did not find any significant issues that we believe needed to be remediated 
we updated those phase i assessments in conjunction with providing security for financing for the codman acquisition and found no issues at that time either 
based on information currently available  we do not believe that we have any material environmental liabilities 
we cannot be certain  however  that environmental issues will not be discovered or arise in the future related to these acquisitions 
based on information currently available  we do not believe that we have any material environmental liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for our judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  which may be affected by our estimates and assumptions  are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on orders received from customers when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that is supportive of revenue recognition  the customer has made a fixed commitment to purchase the product for a fixed or determinable sales price  collection is reasonably assured under our normal billing and credit terms  and ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is normally upon shipment 
in certain circumstances  customer terms require receipt of product prior to the transfer of the risk of ownership 
in such circumstances  revenue is not recognized upon shipment  but rather upon confirmation of delivery 
for product sales to distributors  the corporation recognizes revenue upon shipment to the distributor under standard contract terms stating that title to the goods passes to the distributors at point of shipment to the distributor s location 
all shipments to distributors are at contract prices and payment is not contingent upon resale of the product 
estimated discounts  rebates  product returns and credits are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period revenue is recognized 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we review our inventory balances quarterly for excess products or obsolete inventory levels and write down  if necessary  the inventory to net realizable value 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of definite lived long lived assets when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  undiscounted cash flows  or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of technology and non compete intangible assets which are amortized using the straight line method  as well as customer related intangible assets which are amortized on an accelerated method 
all of the corporation s intangible assets were acquired in connection with our 
table of contents various acquisitions 
the corporation is required to reassess the expected useful lives of existing intangible assets annually 
we reviewed our amortizing intangible assets and have not recorded any impairment related to these assets for fiscal  or goodwill is not amortized but is periodically tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
potential impairment is determined by comparing estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit 
fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the corporation has multiple operating segments which are comprised of multiple components that represent the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available and the operating results of that component are regularly reviewed by management 
the corporation aggregates certain components that share similar economic similarities and that are vertically integrated within the same operating segment into reporting units 
we completed our annual impairment testing and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed for fiscal  or the corporation s clamonta facility  which is a reporting unit for goodwill impairment purposes  had a calculated fair value in excess of carrying value of as of our goodwill impairment analysis date of october  all other reporting units with goodwill generated fair values in excess of carrying value as a result of our goodwill impairment test of between to of the reporting units carrying value 
due to strong forecasted revenues at our clamonta facility we do not expect fair value to decline below carrying value into the foreseeable future 
as of december   clamonta s goodwill was approximately million 
intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to review each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as well as an annual impairment test 
in connection with the codman acquisition in december  we elected to discontinue use of the ssi tradename and renamed the hospital direct business symmetry surgical 
this resulted in the full impairment of the ssi tradename of million in which has been reflected in the impairment of intangible asset line item in the consolidated statements of operations and within the symmetry surgical reportable segment 
we reviewed all other intangible assets and have not recorded any impairment related to the remaining assets for fiscal  or the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects management s assumptions and estimates 
factors that management must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates  as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific reporting unit to which the assets are attributed 
changes in these estimates could change our conclusion regarding the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets and potentially result in a non cash impairment in the future period 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable service period 
compensation cost for performance based awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
there have been no grants of stock options since for restricted stock subject to service conditions or with performance targets  the fair market value of the award is determined based upon the closing value of the corporation s stock price on the grant date and the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for restricted stock with service conditions or with performance targets  the total 
table of contents expense recognized for each grant is only for those awards that ultimately vest 
we also grant restricted stock which vest upon achieving certain market conditions and the grant date fair values for these awards were estimated based upon the results of a monte carlo model  and the resulting expense will be recorded regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards with market conditions is not recorded if the employee is no longer an employee of the corporation 
refer to note for additional information on our compensation plans 
income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation have been prepared using the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the expected future tax consequences of net operating losses  credits  and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
additionally  we use tax planning strategies as part of our global tax compliance program 
judgments and interpretation of statutes are inherent in this process 
the corporation provides related valuation reserves  where applicable  in accounting for uncertain tax positions 
interest and penalties associated with reserves for uncertain tax positions are classified in income tax expense in the statements of operations 
impact of recently issued and adopted accounting standards presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  the corporation must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this standard will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have an impact on the corporation s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations in december  the fasb issued asu disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
asu requires that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplementary pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
we adopted the amendment provisions of asu for the year ended december  as asu is a disclosure standard  the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
historically  we have managed our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed rate and variable rate debt and through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt with no interest 
table of contents rate swaps in place  however approximately million of this amount was borrowed on december  associated with the acquisition of codman 
the weighted average interest rate for this debt as of december  was due to the new borrowings being held at base rate of at year end 
we reviewed economic factors throughout in consideration of entering into interest rate swaps  however it was not deemed necessary 
our amended credit agreement requires that we hedge the interest on at least of the current and projected borrowings under the amended credit agreement for a period of at least years beginning no later than march  holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a global company with holdings in the united kingdom  france  ireland  switzerland  malaysia and germany  we experienced an impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations in fiscal as a result of the fluctuation in rates for fiscal year  we experienced increases in our revenue by million  our gross margin by million and our net income by million 
the impact of rates had minimal impact on our revenue  gross margin or net income in the fourth quarter our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are pound sterling us dollar and sterling us dollar 
at december   the potential reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be approximately million 
this foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which we are exposed would simultaneously decrease by because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities  such as plastic  titanium  stainless steel  cobalt chrome and aluminum 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can impact product costs 
to manage these fluctuations  we utilize competitive pricing methods such as bulk purchases  blanket orders and long term contracts with our major suppliers to reduce short term fluctuations 
for  we have entered into purchasing contracts on certain raw materials totaling million at fixed prices in order to manage our risk of commodity price movements 
additionally  we often do not set prices for our products in advance of our commodity purchases  therefore  we can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
in instances where we have supply agreements with customers  many of these agreements allow us to partially adjust prices for the impact of any raw material price increases 
however  to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be adversely affected
