item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the company s estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although management believes that it uses appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require the company to increase provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
acquired loans 
due to the bank acquisitions in  the company added a significant accounting policy related to acquired loans 
loans that the company acquired are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses 
determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest 
going forward  the company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments  and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s asset and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
in determining the valuation allowance  the company uses historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
these underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if the company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
when these assets are evaluated for impairment  if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to income 
the fair value is based on observable market prices  when practicable 
other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable  including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
in the event of future changes in fair value  the company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
determination of other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company evaluates debt and equity securities within the company s available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other than temporary impairment otti  at least quarterly 
if the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security  otti is required to be recognized if any of the following are met the company intends to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or for debt securities  the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
for all impaired debt securities that the company intends to sell  or more likely than not will be required to sell  the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as otti through earnings 
credit related otti for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings 
noncredit related otti for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
in evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for otti  the company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
any otti on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
trading assets  securities available for sale  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  or to establish a loss allowance or write down based on the fair value of impaired assets 
further  the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value 
due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process  the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

investment securities 
total investment securities increased by million in this increase included the million fair value of securities recorded in the business combinations  as well as the investment of excess funds generated from organic deposit growth 
at year end  most of the growth was represented in the million increase in securities available for sale  along with a million increase in restricted equity investments primarily consisting of federal home loan bank stock held by the acquired banks 
the increase in securities available for sale mainly consisted of a million increase in us government agency sponsored mortgage backed securities which were mostly planned amortization class bonds with average expected lives targeted in the year range 
berkshire s goal is to maintain a high quality portfolio consisting primarily of liquid investment securities with managed durations to limit the potential for market value declines in rising rate markets 
at year end  berkshire s million securities portfolio was primarily comprised of million in us government or government agency sponsored mortgage backed securities  which constituted of the total portfolio  compared to million of the portfolio at the start of the year 
municipal securities and development bonds were little changed  totaling million of the portfolio at year end other significant components of the portfolio at year end included million of corporate bonds and trust preferred securities  million of marketable equity securities consisting primarily of regional community bank stocks  and million of restricted securities which mostly consisted of federal home loan bank stock 
approximately of the total portfolio was designated as available for sale  with the primary exceptions being the restricted stock and locally issued development bonds classified as held to maturity municipal securities except for one security classified as a trading obligation as a result of a related interest rate swap 
the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale totaled million  or of book value at year end  compared to a year earlier

regarding the above mentioned pooled trust preferred security  the unrealized loss measured of book value at year end  compared to of book value at the start of the year 
the company evaluated the security  with a level fair value of million at year end with the assistance of independent third parties  the company modeled cash flows and defaults and evaluated the loss protection provided by the pool s junior tranches 
there was no evidence of other than temporary impairment based on both the company s plan and ability to hold the security until the recovery of its remaining amortized cost and the protection from credit loss afforded by excess subordination above projected losses 
the level fair value of the security was determined with the assistance of a third party by a subjective assessment of market conditions for similar securities 
interest payments on this security have been suspended by the issuer  but it has been maintained on an accruing status based on the company s cash flow analysis and the subordination protecting the company s tranche 
in addition to this pooled trust preferred security  at year end the company owned million in single issuer trust preferred securities issued primarily by prominent national and major regional banks  all of which had at least one investment grade rating at year end

including this growth  the total organic increase in commercial loan outstandings was million annualized 
berkshire is adhering to strong underwriting and pricing disciplines as it captures larger market share with high grade loan originations 
berkshire has emphasized commercial business loan originations in order to diversify its portfolio and to utilize the expertise of its lending teams to build more profitable relationships utilizing its service and product capabilities 
berkshire also expects to benefit from its recruitment of an established commercial lending team announced in december  which is now operating from the company s new westborough office serving the commercial middle market in central and eastern massachusetts 
in conjunction with its planned acquisition of the connecticut bank trust company  berkshire expects to develop its commercial lending footprint in the worcester  springfield  hartford triangle  as well as continuing to enhance its commercial presence in eastern massachusetts 
as a result of its commercial loan origination activities  the company achieved progress towards its goal of reducing the proportion of commercial real estate loans  which decreased to of the commercial portfolio at year end  compared to at the start of the year

in  berkshire originated million in residential mortgages  selling million and retaining million in portfolio 
in the prior year  mortgage originations totaled million  with million being sold and million being retained

based on year end outstanding loan balances  the line of credit utilization rate was both at the end and at the beginning of home equity balances outstanding decreased by on an organic basis in  reflecting in part the drop in demand due to refinancings and the low fixed rate mortgage alternatives 
yields have generally been declining for many loan categories during due to the impact of run off and of the ongoing low interest rate environment on originations 
loan yields benefited from the higher rates associated with the rome small business loan portfolio and rates associated with some of the legacy commercial real estate portfolio 
loan yields also benefited from the higher rates assigned to acquired non performing and higher risk loans as a result of fair value accounting 
with this benefit  the yield on total average loans in the fourth quarter of was down only slightly from in the same quarter of similarly  for the year  the average loan yield decreased slightly to from in the prior year 
the average balance of total loans increased by to billion in  reflecting the partial year benefit of the acquired loan portfolios 
berkshire continues to favor an asset sensitive interest rate risk profile  and seeks to manage the retention of long term fixed rate loans 
a portion of fixed rate residential mortgage originations is sold in the secondary market  and interest rate swaps are sometimes used to provide fixed rate protection where it is sought by large commercial borrowers 
the total amount of swapped commercial loans increased to million from million in the bank offers back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial loan customers  which effectively allows the bank to book a variable rate loan while providing the customer with an option to fix its interest rate 
this allows the company to be more competitive with national financing sources and to avoid booking long term  fixed rate assets at current low interest rates  as well as providing a source of fee income 
commercial loan swap fee income decreased to million in from million in the prior year due to lower demand for fixed rate protection in the ongoing low interest rate environment 
total loans with repricings over five years increased to million at year end  compared to million at the beginning of the year 
in addition to the impact of the acquired loan portfolios  this growth also reflected the increased retention of fixed rate mortgage loan originations during the year to offset the impact of loan prepayments and indirect auto loan run off on interest income 
total loans repricing under three months increased in to million from million  including the impact of growth in commercial business loans 
asset quality 
under accounting standards for business combinations  acquired loans are recorded at fair value and are deemed performing regardless of their payment status

non performing assets were of total assets at year end total non performing assets were million at year end  compared to million at the start of the year 
loans which became non performing during the year totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year 
growth in non performing assets in was partially offset by resolutions totaling million including upgrades  collections  and charge offs 
new non performing assets were primarily commercial real estate development loans originated prior to the recession where development plans did not come to fruition 
residential mortgages contributed million to the increase in non performing assets  due to a limited number of loans which became past due 
at year end  the largest non performing asset was a million commercial land loan 
the ten largest non performing loans totaled million and were generally well secured  with million in impairment reserves required as of year end 
accruing loans over days past due measured of total loans at year end  compared to at the start of the year 
this increase included past due loans acquired in the business combinations  which are recorded as accruing under accounting standards for business combinations  as well as an increase in delinquent residential mortgages 
loans delinquent days increased to of total loans from due primarily to a small number of commercial real estate loans

there were no net charge offs recorded for acquired loans 
the acquired loans were recorded with million in non accretable discounts representing the expected uncollectable contractual amounts owed on acquired loans 
the expected cash flows of acquired loans are evaluated quarterly 
the credit risk profile of the company s loan portfolio is described in the loans footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s risk management process focuses primary attention on loans with higher than normal risk  which includes loans rated special mention and classified substandard and lower 
these loans are referred to as criticized loans  and criticized assets are the total of criticized loans and foreclosed real estate 
the company measures criticized and classified assets in comparison to total assets and to the sum of tier one regulatory capital plus the loan loss allowance 
criticized assets  total assets  and capital increased as a result of the business combinations in as noted above  acquired loans were recorded at fair value  net of estimated nonaccretable credit discounts  and all acquired loans were recorded as performing 
the recorded values were in line with estimates made by berkshire during due diligence prior to negotiating the final terms of the merger agreements  and the quality and performance of acquired criticized assets has been within the range of berkshire s expectations 
total criticized assets were million at year end  compared to million at the start of the year  decreasing to of total assets from during the year 
compared to the sum of tier one capital plus the loan loss allowance  criticized assets decreased to from during the year

the ten largest of these loans totaled million  with the largest loan having a million balance and two other loans with balances over million 
these three loans were all commercial office and retail rental properties that were performing and not viewed as impaired 
loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
the company s methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in item of this report and item includes further information about the accounting policy for the loan loss allowance and the company s accounting for the allowance in the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses appropriate to cover probable losses which can be reasonably estimated and which are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
under accounting standards for business combinations  acquired loans are recorded at fair value with no loan loss allowance on the date of acquisition 
a loan loss allowance is recorded by the company for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses relating to acquired loans which were not impaired as of the acquisition date 
because of the accounting for acquired loans  some measures of the loan loss allowance are not comparable to periods prior to the acquisition date 
the total amount of the loan loss allowance was million at year end  compared to million at the start of the year 
this increase included a million general reserve on acquired loans reflecting further seasoning and environmental factors in the second half of the year 
the allowance related to historical loans measured of historical loans excluding acquired loans at year end  compared to at the start of the year 
this reflected general improvement in the credit profile of historical loans during the year 
additionally  the decrease in the general allowance allocated to business loans included the impact of the company s additional experience and history with its asset based lending program 
the loan loss allowance measured of total loans at year end the specific valuation allowance assigned to impaired loans increased slightly to million from million during the year 
total loans deemed impaired increased to million from million at the start of the year 
the allowance provided x coverage of net loan charge offs in and x coverage of year end non performing loans 
other assets the total amount of cash and short term investments increased by million at year end  compared to the start of the year

goodwill increased by million  including million related to the rome acquisition and million related to the legacy acquisition  less amounts related to discontinued operations 
goodwill is the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for these acquisitions and the fair value of net assets and liabilities acquired 
the balance of goodwill includes goodwill related to prior acquisitions 
goodwill is analyzed annually for impairment in accordance with accounting standards  and there was no impairment charge recognized based on the most recent analysis in other intangible assets increased by million  primarily due to the fair value of the core deposit intangible assets recorded for the rome and legacy acquisitions 
these assets are being amortized over eight ten years based on the sum of the years digits method 
the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance policies increased by million primarily due to policies acquired with the rome and legacy mergers 
these policies are primarily general account policies issued by carriers rated a or better 
increases in the cash surrender value of these policies are recorded in non interest income 
there is no income tax expense associated with this income  which partially offsets the cost of employee benefits 
in  the tax equivalent yield on the average balance of these policies was approximately compared to in the prior year 
total other assets increased by million in this included a million increase in tax assets plus the addition of various receivable  prepaid  and other miscellaneous assets from the acquired banks 
the total balance of the net deferred tax asset stood at million at year end  including a million increase during the year primarily due to the impact of deferred tax adjustments related to fair value adjustments and core deposit intangible assets recognized with the bank acquisitions 
these deferred tax balances will be amortized as the related purchase accounting impacts are amortized into income in future years 
the million balance of assets from discontinued operations represents loans  premises  and other assets related to the branches held for sale at year end deposits 
total deposits increased by million to billion in this included million in acquired rome balances and million in acquired legacy balances and excluded million in deposits transferred to discontinued operations 
the acquired rome and legacy deposits excluding discontinued operations included million in transaction balances  million in money market balances  million in savings balances  and million in time account balances 
as a result of acquired balances and organic activity  money market balances increased from to of total deposits  and time accounts decreased from to of the total 
transaction and savings account balances remained unchanged at and of total deposits  respectively 
excluding the million net total of balances related to acquisitions and divestitures  total organic deposit growth was million in most of this organic growth was in the albany  new york region 
the new york growth reflected ongoing deposit growth related to the bank s de novo branches opened in recent years in this strategically important region 
the bank opened an additional two branches in this region in overall organic growth was strongest in checking account balances and money market account balances 
berkshire promotes these account types  which provide more relationship cross sale opportunities 
organic deposit growth has included the contribution of growth in commercial balances related to the increased volumes of commercial business 
by emphasizing lower cost non maturity deposits and lowering time deposit costs  the company has reduced the cost of its deposits in order to offset the impact of lower asset yields in the current low interest rate environment 
the average annualized cost of deposits decreased to in the fourth quarter of from in the fourth quarter of a total of million in time deposits are scheduled to mature in  and the weighted average cost of time deposits is expected to continue to decline based on continuing low interest rates 
the average balance of total deposits increased by to billion in  including the impact of the bank acquisitions during the year 
borrowings and debentures 
total borrowings and debentures decreased by million to million in  as excess liquidity from deposit growth was used to pay down short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank

recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities and derivative instruments 
a valuation hierarchy is utilized based on generally accepted accounting principles 
measurements based on level inputs rely the most on subjective management judgments 
level recurring measurements relate primarily to the million fair value of a local tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a berkshire county non profit  which is classified as a trading security 
changes in the fair value of this security are recorded in non interest income  as are offsetting changes in the accompanying interest rate swap 
non recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to securities held to maturity  restricted equity securities  impaired loans  and goodwill and other intangibles 
when measurement is required  these measures are generally based on level inputs 
non recurring fair values of financial instruments relate primarily to impairment analysis of economic development bonds recorded as held to maturity  restricted equity securities  and loans 
the only assets deemed impaired were million in loans  which were evaluated based on level inputs  which gave rise to a million impairment reserve at year end fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to impairment analyses of intangibles and goodwill 
the company performed an impairment analysis of its goodwill in the most recent quarter  and determined that there was no impairment at year end the company also provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter end 
the category of financial assets with the most significant difference between carrying value and fair value is the net loan category 
the fair value of loans is estimated to be a million premium to carrying value at year end  compared to a million discount to carrying value at year end this improvement reflected the improved credit profile of the loan portfolio in  along with the impact of lower medium term rates and market pricing spreads for loans 
of note  loans acquired in bank acquisitions were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition  whereas the carrying value of historical loans is based on cost 
regarding the total fair value of deposits  borrowings  and debenture  there was no significant difference between fair value and carrying amount at either year end 
the excess fair value of deposits over carrying amount was eliminated primarily due to the ongoing runoff of higher costing time deposits 
due to the premium value of loans in  the combined impact of the above fair value estimates reflected an overall improvement in the economic value of equity related to these instruments  based solely on the measures utilized for the purpose of this analysis 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the company seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
the company maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the company has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
the company also uses interest rate swaps in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped change in market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
the chart below shows the analysis of a ramped change 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
item a table qualitative aspects of market risk change in interest rates basis months months points rate ramp change change change change in thousands at december  at december  at year end  there were no significant changes in the indicators of near term net interest income at risk as shown in the table above 
the table shows that berkshire has maintained a moderately asset sensitive interest rate risk profile 
with this profile  net interest income will increase if interest rates rise and net interest income will decline if they fall assuming a parallel shift in the yield curve and unchanged market spreads to treasuries for various categories of assets and liabilities 
short term us treasury rates are currently near zero and the federal reserve bank has indicated an expectation that they will be maintained at these levels through most of the company views it as unlikely that short term rates will decrease significantly from current levels 
the addition of rome and legacy increased interest bearing assets and liabilities  but did not materially change modeled interest rate sensitivity of net interest income 
based on berkshire s review of rome s balance sheet and balance sheet changes subsequent to the merger  berkshire models that the interest rate risk of rome s operations was modestly liability sensitive 
legacy s analysis at the same date demonstrated modest liability sensitivity 
after integrating these two banks and restructuring the borrowings and securities  berkshire estimates that there has been no material change to its measures of its asset sensitivity after completing these mergers 
this is consistent with its earlier estimates and includes the impact of million in new forward starting interest rate swaps in  which have the effect of limiting the impact of potential future higher interest rates on funding costs 
berkshire does not expect any material change in its interest rate sensitivity based on the anticipated acquisition and integration of the connecticut bank and trust company in the second quarter of the company also estimates the sensitivity of the economic value of its equity to interest rate shocks 
at year end  the company estimated that this measure would decrease by approximately in the event of a basis point upward interest rate shock  which was well within the company s policy limits 
the decrease reflects the impact of fixed rate assets on medium and long term modeled net income if interest rates increase 
this estimate is subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and is not intended as a projection of future operating results 
the market is expected to experience some general yield compression if short term rates remain near zero for the next three years and if international and other economic events continue to hold down long term us interest rates 
the company expects that interest rates will increase over the medium term from currently suppressed levels and that there is the potential for rate spikes based on economic or financial shocks in the domestic and global markets 
berkshire continues to target ongoing loan growth as it pursues its market share acquisition strategies 
part of this growth is expected to include growth in residential mortgages  which are primarily fixed rate instruments 
the interest rate risk impact of this growth will be somewhat offset by commercial loan growth  which tends to emphasize adjustable rate loans  including libor based loans 
the company anticipates that its asset sensitivity based on its model for net interest income sensitivity may move towards a more neutral position  while still remaining asset sensitive 
the company s long term target is to maintain a net interest margin above  and this objective will be balanced with the company s interest rate risk management and with its goals to increase low cost transaction account funds sources 
berkshire has a number of business strategies to increase net interest income despite the potential for tighter market yields 
these include changes in volumes and mix of interest bearing assets and liabilities  some of which are discussed above 
the company also evaluates its pricing strategies on an ongoing basis  and considers its investment  borrowings  and derivatives strategies in managing its income and risk profile 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  the modeled computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change 
the rate sensitivity depends on the underlying amount of market rate change and the type of deposit account 
the percentage rate movements are as follows now accounts ranging between and  money market accounts ranging between and  and savings accounts ranging between and 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
due to the extraordinary fiscal and monetary interventions in the domestic and international markets since  there is elevated uncertainty about future market conditions and about customer demand and behaviors in the event of future interest rate changes 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
