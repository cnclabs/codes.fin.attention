item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates hedging activities and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the dodd frank act was signed into law by the president on july   and requires the commodities futures trading commission  referred to as the cftc  and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the act also requires the cftc to institute broad new position limits for futures and options traded on regulated exchanges 
as the law favors exchange trading and clearing  the dodd frank act also may require us to move certain derivatives transactions to exchanges where no trade credit is provided and also comply with margin requirements in connection with our derivatives activities that are not exchange traded  although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time 
the dodd frank act also requires many counterparties to our derivatives instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty  or cause the entity to comply with the capital requirements  which could result in increased costs to counterparties such as us 
the dodd frank act and any new regulations could i significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including those requirements to post collateral  which could adversely affect our available liquidity  ii reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  and iii reduce the liquidity of energy related derivatives 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors 
finally  the dodd frank act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our kinder morgan canada segment is subject to us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 
we are a us dollar reporting company 
as a result of the operations of our kinder morgan canada business segment  a portion of our consolidated assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between united states and canadian dollars could expose us to reductions in the us dollar value of our earnings and cash flows and a reduction in our partners capital under applicable accounting rules 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 
economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in several industries  including the oil and gas industry  the steel industry and in specific segments and markets in which we operate  resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our products and services 
our operating results in one or more geographic regions also may be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region  such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states and canada 
volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our customers  which in turn could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us 
in addition  decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of our co business segment 
if global economic and market conditions including volatility in commodity markets  or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets  remain uncertain or persist  spread or deteriorate further  we may experience material impacts on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of content hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our pipelines  terminals and other assets are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
these natural disasters could potentially damage or destroy our pipelines  terminals and other assets and disrupt the supply of the products we transport through our pipelines 
natural disasters can similarly affect the facilities of our customers 
in either case  losses could exceed our insurance coverage and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
risks related to our common units the interests of kmi may differ from our interests and the interests of our unitholders 
kmi indirectly owns all of the common stock of our general partner and elects all of its directors 
our general partner owns all of kmr s voting shares and elects all of its directors 
furthermore  some of kmr s directors and officers are also directors and officers of kmi and our general partner and have fiduciary duties to manage the businesses of kmi in a manner that may not be in the best interests of our unitholders 
kmi has a number of interests that differ from the interests of our unitholders 
as a result  there is a risk that important business decisions will not be made in the best interests of our unitholders 
common unitholders have limited voting rights and limited control 
holders of common units have only limited voting rights on matters affecting us 
our general partner manages partnership activities 
under a delegation of control agreement  our general partner has delegated the management and control of our and our subsidiaries business and affairs to kmr 
holders of common units have no right to elect the general partner on an annual or other ongoing basis 
if the general partner withdraws  however  its successor may be elected by the holders of a majority of the outstanding common units excluding units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates 
the limited partners may remove the general partner only if i the holders of at least of the outstanding common units  excluding common units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates  vote to remove the general partner  ii a successor general partner is approved by at least of the outstanding common units  excluding common units owned by the departing general partner and its affiliates  and iii we receive an opinion of counsel opining that the removal would not result in the loss of limited liability to any limited partner  or the limited partner of an operating partnership  or cause us or the operating partnership to be taxed other than as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
a person or group owning or more of the common units cannot vote 
any common units held by a person or group that owns or more of the common units cannot be voted 
this limitation does not apply to the general partner and its affiliates 
this provision may i discourage a person or group from attempting to remove the general partner or otherwise change management  and ii reduce the price at which the common units will trade under certain circumstances 
for example  a third party will probably not attempt to take over our management by making a tender offer for the common units at a price above their trading market price without removing the general partner and substituting an affiliate of its own 
the general partner s liability to us and our unitholders may be limited 
our partnership agreement contains language limiting the liability of the general partner to us or the holders of common units 
for example  our partnership agreement provides that i the general partner does not breach any duty to us or the holders of common units by borrowing funds or approving any borrowing the general partner is protected even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to increase incentive distributions to the general partner  ii the general partner does not breach any duty to us or the holders of common units by taking any actions consistent with the standards of reasonable discretion outlined in the definitions of available cash and cash from operations contained in our partnership agreement  and iii the general partner does not breach any standard of care or duty by resolving conflicts of interest unless the general partner acts in bad faith 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions 
unitholders will not be liable for assessments in addition to their initial capital investment in the common units 
under certain circumstances  however  holders of common units may have to repay us amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under delaware law  we may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution causes our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and non recourse liabilities are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of such a distribution  a limited partner who receives the distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
under delaware law  an assignee who becomes a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership 
however  such an assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a limited partner if the liabilities could not be determined from the partnership agreement 
unitholders may be liable if we have not complied with state partnership law 
we conduct our business in a number of states 
in some of those states the limitations on the liability of limited partners for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established 
the unitholders might be held liable for the partnership s obligations as if they were a general partner if i a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in the state but had not complied with the state s partnership statute  or ii unitholders rights to act together to remove or replace the general partner or take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 

table of content the general partner may buy out minority unitholders if it owns of the units 
if at any time the general partner and its affiliates own or more of the issued and outstanding common units  the general partner will have the right to purchase all  and only all  of the remaining common units 
because of this right  a unitholder could have to sell its common units at a time or price that may be undesirable 
the purchase price for such a purchase will be the greater of i the day average trading price for the common units as of the date five days prior to the date the notice of purchase is mailed  or ii the highest purchase price paid by the general partner or its affiliates to acquire common units during the prior days 
the general partner can assign this right to its affiliates or to us 
we may sell additional limited partner interests  diluting existing interests of unitholders 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to issue additional common units and other equity securities 
when we issue additional equity securities  including additional i units to kmr when it issues additional shares  unitholders proportionate partnership interest in us will decrease 
such an issuance could negatively affect the amount of cash distributed to unitholders and the market price of common units 
issuance of additional common units will also diminish the relative voting strength of the previously outstanding common units 
our partnership agreement does not limit the total number of common units or other equity securities we may issue 
the general partner can protect itself against dilution 
whenever we issue equity securities to any person other than the general partner and its affiliates  the general partner has the right to purchase additional limited partnership interests on the same terms 
this allows the general partner to maintain its proportionate partnership interest in us 
no other unitholder has a similar right 
therefore  only the general partner may protect itself against dilution caused by issuance of additional equity securities 
our partnership agreement and the kmr limited liability company agreement restrict or eliminate a number of the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner and or its delegate to our unitholders 
modifications of state law standards of fiduciary duties may significantly limit the ability of our unitholders to successfully challenge the actions of our general partner in the event of a breach of fiduciary duties 
these state law standards include the duties of care and loyalty 
the duty of loyalty  in the absence of a provision in the limited partnership agreement to the contrary  would generally prohibit our general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest 
our limited partnership agreement contains provisions that prohibit limited partners from advancing claims that otherwise might raise issues as to compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law 
for example  that agreement provides that the general partner may take into account the interests of parties other than us in resolving conflicts of interest 
it also provides that in the absence of bad faith by the general partner  the resolution of a conflict by the general partner will not be a breach of any duty 
the provisions relating to the general partner apply equally to kmr as its delegate 
it is not necessary for a limited partner to sign our limited partnership agreement in order for the limited partnership agreement to be enforceable against that person 

table of content our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service were to treat us as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
to maintain our status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  current law requires that or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which we refer to as the code 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  on this or any other matter affecting us 
despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible under certain circumstances for such an entity to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  we would pay us federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of  and would pay state income taxes at varying rates 
distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed on us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our common unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the amount of distributions we pay  and in the value of our common units 
current law or our business may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation 
members of congress are considering substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that could affect the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships 
for example  federal income tax legislation recently has been considered by congress that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships 
although the legislation most recently considered by congress would not appear to affect our tax treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  we are unable to predict whether any other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
any such changes could negatively impact our cash flows and the value of our common units 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are now subject to an entity level tax on the portion of our total revenue that is generated in texas 
specifically  the texas margin tax is imposed at a maximum effective rate of of our gross income that is apportioned to texas 
this tax reduces  and the imposition of such a tax on us by another state will reduce  the cash available for distribution to our common unitholders 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for us federal income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our common units could be subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships  including us  or an investment in our common units  may be modified by administrative  legislative or judicial interpretation at any time 
any modification to the us federal income tax laws or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
although we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted  any changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations  and  accordingly  our counsel is unable to opine as to the validity of this method 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our common unitholders 

table of content if the irs contests the us federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the conclusions of our counsel or from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of our counsel s conclusions or the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of our counsel s conclusions or the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our common unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
our common unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our common unitholders are treated as partners to whom we allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  they are required to pay any us federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
common unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income 
tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected 
if a common unitholder sells its common units  the common unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that common unitholder s adjusted tax basis in those common units 
because distributions in excess of a common unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease that unitholder s tax basis in its common units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to the common units sold will  in effect  become taxable income allocated to that unitholder if the unitholder sells such common units at a price greater than that unitholder s tax basis in those common units  even if the price received is less than the original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized may include a common unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells its common units  such unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non us persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts known as iras  and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from us federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file non us federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
any tax exempt entity or non us person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our common units 
our treatment of a purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged  resulting in a reduction in value of our common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units  we are required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these common units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these common units 
we do so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the us treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a common unitholder of ownership of our common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a common unitholder s tax returns 
we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 

table of content because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
our counsel is unable to opine on the validity of such filing positions 
we adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between our general partner and the common unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
when we issue additional common units or engage in certain other transactions  we determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our common unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and our general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our current valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their adjustment under section b of the code allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the adjustment under section b of the code attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between our general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our common unitholders and our general partner 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our common unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our common unitholders or our general partner s tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in a termination of our partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within any twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a significant deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a common unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income being includable in the common unitholder s taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
a common unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of those common units 
if so  the common unitholder would no longer be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a common unitholder whose common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of the loaned common units  the unitholder may no longer be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the common unitholder and any cash distributions received by the common unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion regarding the treatment of a unitholder where common units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of common units  therefore  common unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units 
the issuance of additional i units may cause more taxable income and gain to be allocated to the common units 
the i units we issue to kmr generally are not allocated income  gain  loss or deduction for us federal income tax purposes until such time as we are liquidated 
therefore  the issuance of additional i units may cause more taxable income and gain to be allocated to the common unitholders 

table of content as a result of investing in our common units  a common unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire property 
in addition to us federal income taxes  our common unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including foreign  state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
our common unitholders will likely be required to file foreign  state and local income tax returns and pay foreign  state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  our common unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we currently own assets and conduct business in numerous states in the united states and in canada 
it is the responsibility of each common unitholder to file all required us federal  foreign  state and local tax returns 
our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the foreign  state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units 
risks related to ownership of our common units if we or kmi defaults on debt unitholders may have negative tax consequences if we default on our debt or sell assets 
if we default on any of our debt  the lenders will have the right to sue us for non payment 
such an action could cause an investment loss and cause negative tax consequences for unitholders through the realization of taxable income by unitholders without a corresponding cash distribution 
likewise  if we were to dispose of assets and realize a taxable gain while there is substantial debt outstanding and proceeds of the sale were applied to the debt  unitholders could have increased taxable income without a corresponding cash distribution 
there is the potential for a change of control of our general partner if kmi defaults on debt 
kmi indirectly owns all the common stock of kinder morgan gp  inc  our general partner 
if kmi or kinder morgan kansas  inc defaults on its debt  then the lenders under such debt  in exercising their rights as lenders  could acquire control of our general partner or otherwise influence our general partner through control of kmi or kinder morgan kansas  inc item b

our reportable business segments are products pipelines the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products pipelines that deliver gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and natural gas liquids to various markets  plus the ownership and or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities  natural gas pipelines the ownership and operation of major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems  plus the ownership and or operation of associated natural gas processing and treating facilities  co i the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  referred to as co  to oil fields that use co to increase production of oil  ii ownership interests in and or operation of oil fields in west texas  and iii the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas  terminals the ownership and or operation of liquids and bulk terminal facilities and rail transloading and materials handling facilities located throughout the united states and portions of canada  and kinder morgan canada i the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton  alberta  canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia  canada and the state of washington  ii the interest in the express crude oil pipeline system  which connects canadian and us producers to refineries located in the us rocky mountain and midwest regions  and iii the jet fuel aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver canada international airport 

table of content as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states and canada s various energy businesses and markets  we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 
many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies and a portion of our business portfolio including our kinder morgan canada business segment  the canadian portion of our cochin pipeline  and our bulk and liquids terminal facilities located in canada uses the local canadian dollar as the functional currency for its canadian operations and enters into foreign currency based transactions  both of which affect segment results due to the inherent variability in us canadian dollar exchange rates 
to help understand our reported operating results  all of the following references to foreign currency effects or similar terms in this section represent our estimates of the changes in financial results  in us dollars  resulting from fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
the references are made to facilitate period to period comparisons of business performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other registrants 
the profitability of our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the volume of refined petroleum products that we transport and the prices we receive for our services 
transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the refined petroleum products being shipped or stored 
demand for refined petroleum products tends to track in large measure demographic and economic growth  and with the exception of periods of time with very high product prices or recessionary conditions  demand tends to be relatively stable 
because of that  we seek to own refined petroleum products pipelines located in  or that transport to  stable or growing markets and population centers 
the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities  the revenues from these assets are primarily received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various and extended periods of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
these long term contracts are typically structured with a fixed fee reserving the right to transport natural gas and specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available  whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity 
similarly  in our texas intrastate pipeline business  we currently derive approximately of our sales and transport margins from long term transport and sales contracts that include requirements with minimum volume payment obligations 
as contracts expire  we have additional exposure to the longer term trends in supply and demand for natural gas 
as of december   the remaining average contract life of our natural gas transportation contracts including our intrastate pipelines was approximately eight years 
our co sales and transportation business primarily has contracts with minimum volume requirements  which as of december   had a remaining average contract life of four years this remaining average contract life includes intercompany sales  when we eliminate intercompany sales  the remaining average contract life is approximately five years 
carbon dioxide sales contracts vary from customer to customer and have evolved over time as supply and demand conditions have changed 
our recent contracts have generally provided for a delivered price tied to the price of crude oil  but with a floor price 
on a volume weighted basis  for contracts making deliveries in  and utilizing the average oil price per barrel contained in our budget  approximately of our contractual volumes are based on a fixed fee or floor price  and fluctuate with the price of oil these percentages include intercompany sales  when we eliminate intercompany sales  the percentages are and  respectively 
in the long term  our success in this business is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide 
however  short term changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum sales volumes under many of our contracts 
in our co segment s oil and gas producing activities  we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that we expect to add 
in that regard  our production during any period is an important measure 
in addition  the revenues we receive from our crude oil  natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products 
over the long term  we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products 
in the shorter term  however  market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management  or hedging  program  in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed  capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts  particularly for crude oil 
our realized weighted average crude oil price per barrel  with all hedges allocated to oil  was per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in 
table of content the factors impacting our terminals business segment generally differ depending on whether the terminal is a liquids or bulk terminal  and in the case of a bulk terminal  the type of product being handled or stored 
as with our refined petroleum products pipeline transportation business  the revenues from our bulk terminals business are generally driven by the volumes we handle and or store  as well as the prices we receive for our services  which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored 
while we handle and store a large variety of products in our bulk terminals  the primary products are coal  petroleum coke  and steel 
for the most part  we have contracts for this business that have minimum volume guarantees and are volume based above the minimums 
because these contracts are volume based above the minimums  our profitability from the bulk business can be sensitive to economic conditions 
our liquids terminals business generally has longer term contracts that require the customer to pay regardless of whether they use the capacity 
thus  similar to our natural gas pipeline business  our liquids terminals business is less sensitive to short term changes in supply and demand 
therefore  the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals business in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts which is typically approximately four years  the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported  and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
in addition  weather related factors such as hurricanes  floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and  thus  the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or  in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities  for longer periods 
in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses that follow see results of operations below  we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 
continuing our history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses  in  we invested approximately billion for both strategic business acquisitions and expansions of existing assets 
our capital investments have helped us to achieve compound annual growth rates in cash distributions to our limited partners of  and  respectively  for the one year  three year and five year periods ended december  thus  the amount that we are able to increase distributions to our unitholders will  to some extent  be a function of our ability to complete successful acquisitions and expansions 
we believe we will continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets  and we have budgeted approximately billion for our capital expansion program  including small acquisitions and investment contributions 
based on our historical record and because there is continued demand for energy infrastructure in the areas we serve  we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future  although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 
in addition  we regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions  including those from kmi or its affiliates  and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions 
while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets  such transactions can be effected quickly  may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations 
our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at the right cost  and includes factors over which we have limited or no control 
thus  we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future  or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 
our ability to make accretive acquisitions or expand our assets is impacted by our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and to raise the necessary capital needed to fund such acquisitions 
as a master limited partnership  we distribute all of our available cash and we access capital markets to fund acquisitions and asset expansions 
historically  we have succeeded in raising necessary capital in order to fund our acquisitions and expansions  and although we cannot predict future changes in the overall equity and debt capital markets in terms of tightening or loosening of credit  we believe that our stable cash flows  our investment grade credit rating  and our historical record of successfully accessing both equity and debt funding sources should allow us to continue to execute our current investment  distribution and acquisition strategies  as well as refinance maturing debt when required 
for a further discussion of our liquidity  including our public debt and equity offerings in  please see liquidity and capital resources below 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of us generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates  and any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

table of content in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets  ii the fair values used to assign purchase price from business combinations  determine possible asset impairment charges  and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test  iii reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  v exposures under contractual indemnifications  and vi unbilled revenues 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed as follows 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
generally  we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 
these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we consider the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred  accordingly  to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time  is reasonably possible to occur  and may require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
generally  if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
as of december   our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved our west coast products pipelines 
transportation rates charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to proceedings at the ferc and the cpuc involving shipper challenges to the pipelines interstate and intrastate california rates  respectively 
for more information on our regulatory proceedings  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of content intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  are not subject to regular periodic amortization  and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on may of each year 
there were no impairment charges resulting from our may  impairment testing  and no event indicating an impairment has occurred subsequent to that date 
for more information on our goodwill  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
excluding goodwill  our other intangible assets include customer contracts  relationships and agreements  lease value  and technology based assets 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for more information on our amortizable intangibles  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income  and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
according to the provisions of us generally accepted accounting principles  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged  and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 
since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices a perfectly effective hedge we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all 
but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

the increase in plantation s earnings was primarily due to higher oil loss allowance revenues  a increase in transport volumes  and the absence of an expense from the write off of an uncollectible receivable in the first quarter of  an million increase from our west coast terminal operations due mainly to the completion of various terminal expansion projects that increased liquids tank capacity  and partly to higher rates on existing storage  a million decrease from our pacific operations due largely to an million decrease in revenues and a million increase in combined operating expenses 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower average tariffs  due both to lower rates on the system s east line deliveries as a result of rate case settlements since the end of and lower military tenders 
this decrease was partially offset by higher terminal revenues attributable to a increase in ethanol handling volumes 
the increase in operating expenses was mainly due to a million increase in expense associated with liability adjustments made pursuant to an adverse tentative court decision on the amount of rights of way lease payment obligations  a million decrease from our calnev pipeline due largely to a drop in ethanol handling volumes that related to both lower deliveries to the las vegas market and incremental ethanol blending services offered by a competing terminal  and a million decrease from our transmix processing operations due mainly to a million decrease in income from lower product gains relative to

the increase in pipeline delivery revenues was attributable to higher average tariff rates in due in part to ferc approved rate increases and to military tender rate increases 
overall mainline delivery volumes were essentially flat across both years 
the increase in terminal revenues was mainly attributable to incremental ethanol handling services that were due in part to mandated increases in ethanol blending rates in california since the end of  a million increase from our southeast terminal operations due to both increased ethanol throughput driven by continued high demand during in the ethanol and biofuels markets and higher product inventory gains relative to the prior year  a million increase from our west coast terminal operations driven by higher warehousing revenues and incremental customers at our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal system  higher biodiesel revenues from our two portland  oregon liquids facilities  and incremental earnings contributions from the terminals portland  oregon airport pipeline  which was acquired on july   a million increase from our equity investment in plantation 
the increase in plantation s earnings was driven by both higher products transportation revenues and higher oil loss allowance revenues 
the increase in transportation revenues was due to a increase in pipeline throughput volumes  resulting from both an upgrade at a refinery in louisiana and to mainline allocation on a competing pipeline 
the increase in oil loss allowance revenues was associated with the increase in volumes and an increase in products prices  relative to the prior year  a million increase from our central florida pipeline due mainly to incremental product inventory gains and partly to higher ethanol handling revenues  and a million decrease from our cochin pipeline system attributable to a million drop in revenues and a million increase in operating expenses 
the lower revenues reflected a decline in propane delivery volumes  due to milder weather  a drop in grain drying demand  and the negative impacts from unfavorable tariff changes in the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to favorable settlements reached in the first quarter of with the seller of the remaining approximate interest in the cochin pipeline system that we purchased on january

the primary increases and decreases in our natural gas pipelines business segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to were attributable to the following a million increase from our kinder morgan natural gas treating operations due mainly to our acquisitions of natural gas treating operations from crosstex energy  inc on october   and from gas chill  inc on september  combined  the acquired operations contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  revenues of million and operating expenses of million in  a million increase due to incremental contributions from our initial equity ownership interest in kinderhawk  acquired on may a million increase from our equity investment in midcontinent express due primarily to the inclusion of a full year of operations in and the june completion of the expansion project described above 
midcontinent express initiated interim natural gas transportation service for its zone pipeline segment on april   achieved full zone service on may   and achieved full zone service on august   a million increase from our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline system consisting of a million increase in system operating income and a million decrease in non operating other income 
the increase from operations was mainly due to incremental transportation service we commenced limited natural gas transportation service in april and we completed construction and began full transportation service on the system s remaining portions in june 
the drop in non operating income  relative to  reflected lower income pursuant to ferc regulations governing allowances for capital funds that are used for pipeline construction costs an equity cost of capital allowance  an million increase from our casper douglas gas processing operations primarily attributable to higher natural gas processing spreads 
the million year to year increase in revenues was driven by both a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes and a increase in average natural gas liquids sales prices  a million decrease from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system driven by a million decrease due to lower margins on operational sales of natural gas  and a million decrease due to lower pipeline net fuel recoveries 
both decreases were due mainly to lower average natural gas prices in kmigt s operational gas sales are primarily made possible by both collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its currently effective gas transportation tariff  and by recoveries of storage cushion gas volumes  
table of content a million decrease from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group driven by i a million decrease in earnings from overall storage activities primarily due to lower price spreads due to unfavorable market conditions relative to  ii a million decrease from lower interest income  due to a one time natural gas loan to a single customer in  iii a million decrease due to lower natural gas gains primarily due to volume measurement gains related to the normal tracking of natural gas throughout the pipeline system  and iv a million decrease in natural gas sales margins  largely attributable to higher costs of natural gas supplies relative to sales prices and less favorable market conditions 
the overall decrease in earnings in versus was partially offset by a million increase in earnings due to higher natural gas processing margins  due mainly to higher natural gas liquids prices relative to  and a million increase in earnings due to incremental equity earnings from our owned endeavor gathering llc  acquired effective november   and a million decrease from our interest in the rockies express pipeline system 
compared to  rockies express net income on a basis dropped million in the decrease consisted of i a million decrease primarily related to higher interest expenses  net of interest income  and ii a million increase from higher system operating income 
the increase in interest expenses was due to higher non cash allowances for borrowed funds used during construction in which reduces interest expenses  and to debt obligations shifting from short term to long term at higher interest rates in rockies express issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes in a private offering in march to secure permanent financing for the rockies express pipeline construction costs 
the increase in operating income was driven by incremental transportation service revenues related to the completion and start up of the rockies express east pipeline segment  the third and final phase of the rockies express system 
rockies express east began initial pipeline service on june  and began full operations on november  the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales in both pairs of comparable years primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  with the variances from year to year in both revenues and operating expenses mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold 
our intrastate group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas  which is often stored and or transported on its pipelines  and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased  the increases and decreases in its natural gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in its natural gas purchase costs 
it realizes earnings by capturing the favorable differences between the changes in its gas sales prices  purchase prices and transportation costs  including fuel

combined  the unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts used to hedge forecasted crude oil sales and described in footnote a to the table above decreased both earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and revenues by million in compared to  and increased both earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and revenues by million in compared to for each of the segment s two primary businesses  following is information related to the remaining i million and million increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  and ii million and million increases in operating revenues in both and  when compared with the respective prior year year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages oil and gas producing activities sales and transportation activities intrasegment eliminations total co the segment s oil and gas producing activities include the operations associated with its ownership interests in oil producing fields and natural gas processing plants  and generally  earnings from these activities are closely aligned with realized price levels for crude oil and natural gas liquids products 
when compared to  the increase in earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities in was mainly due to the following a million increase due to higher crude oil sales revenues due to higher average realized sales prices for us crude oil 
our realized weighted average price per barrel of crude oil increased in versus the overall increase in crude oil sales revenues was partially offset  however  by a decrease in oil production volumes volumes presented in the results of operations table above  due primarily to a general year over year decline in production at both the sacroc and yates field units  a million increase due to higher net profits interest revenues from our net profits interest in the snyder  texas natural gas processing plant driven by higher natural gas liquids prices  increased producing volumes in the last half of  and the favorable impact from the restructuring of certain liquids processing contracts that became effective at the beginning of the contractual changes increased liquids processing production allocated to the plant  and decreased liquids production allocated to the sacroc field unit  a million increase due to higher natural gas plant products sales revenues due to a increase in our realized weighted average price per barrel of natural gas liquids 
the increase in revenues from higher realized sales prices was partially offset  however  by a decrease in liquids sales volumes  mainly related to the contractual reduction in our net interest in liquids production from the sacroc field described above  and a million decrease due to higher combined operating expenses driven primarily by higher carbon dioxide supply expenses that related to both initiating carbon dioxide injections into the katz field and higher carbon dioxide prices 

table of content the increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses from the segment s sales and transportation activities in compared to was attributable to the following a million increase due to higher carbon dioxide sales revenues primarily due to higher average sales prices 
the segment s average price received for all carbon dioxide sales in increased compared to  due largely to the fact that a portion of its carbon dioxide sales contracts are indexed to oil prices 
in addition  overall carbon dioxide sales volumes increased slightly in versus  a million increase due to higher carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues due mainly to incremental transportation service on our eastern shelf carbon dioxide pipeline 
we completed construction of the pipeline in december  and a million decrease due to higher combined operating expenses driven by higher severance tax expenses and higher carbon dioxide supply expenses  both related to higher commodity prices in year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages oil and gas producing activities sales and transportation activities intrasegment eliminations total co the segment s overall increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to was due to higher earnings from both its oil and gas producing activities and its sales and transportation activities 
the year over year increase in earnings from oil and gas producing activities was due mainly to the following a million increase due to higher operating revenues driven by a million increase in combined crude oil and natural gas plant product sales revenues  due largely to increases of and in our realized weighted average price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids  respectively  and partly to a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes 
the overall increase in sales revenues was somewhat offset by a decline in crude oil sales volumes in  and a million decrease due to higher combined operating expenses driven by a million increase in tax expenses  other than income tax expenses  and a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the increase in other tax expenses was primarily due to a million reduction in severance tax expenses in due to prior year overpayments 
the increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher natural gas processing costs related to both an increase in processing volumes  and higher carbon dioxide purchase costs resulting from higher rates 
similarly  the million year over year increase in earnings from the segment s sales and transportation activities in was also largely revenue related  chiefly due to a million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues 
the increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues was driven by a increase in the average sales price for carbon dioxide 
although our carbon dioxide sales volumes were essentially unchanged across both years  we benefitted from higher average carbon dioxide sales prices in versus due to both continued strong customer demand for carbon dioxide s use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area and to the positive impact on the portion of our carbon dioxide sales contracts that were tied to crude oil prices  which increased since the end of pipeline revenues from transporting both carbon dioxide and crude oil were essentially flat across and  and for our co segment combined  total carbon dioxide delivery volumes decreased almost in versus the decrease in delivery volumes was mainly due to lower consumption of new carbon dioxide at both the sacroc and yates field units 
however  carbon dioxide production from our southwest colorado source fields increased in  and carbon dioxide delivery volumes on our owned cortez pipeline increased by in  both reflecting a slight increase in third party sales compared to our sales and transportation activities also benefitted from a million decrease in income tax expenses in versus  primarily due to favorable adjustments to the segment s accrued texas margin tax liabilities in due to prior year overpayments

we also benefitted from the march completion of our deer park rail terminal and its related ethanol handling assets at our pasadena terminal 
for all of our gulf liquids terminals combined  total ethanol handling volumes increased by in compared to the overall increase in earnings from our midwest terminals was mainly due to higher earnings from the combined operations of our argo and chicago  illinois liquids terminals  due to increased ethanol throughput and incremental liquids storage and handling business  and to higher contributions from our dakota bulk terminal located in st 
paul  minnesota  due to higher sand and salt transload volumes 

table of content the increase in earnings from our southeast terminals was due mainly to higher chemical revenues  increased salt handling  and higher storage fees at our shipyard river terminal  located in charleston  south carolina  and from higher margins from tank blending services involving various agricultural products at our liquids terminal facility located in wilmington  north carolina 
higher overall earnings from our terminals segment in versus were partially offset by lower earnings from terminal operations included in the segment s ohio valley and west regions  due mainly to both lower revenues earned from steel handling and iron ore stevedoring services  and lower agricultural exports due to higher soybean meal exports during as a result of drought conditions in south america 
the remaining increases and decreases in our terminals segment s earnings and revenues reported in the all others line in the table above represent increases and decreases in terminal results at various locations  however the decrease in revenues relate largely to terminal assets we sold or contributed to joint ventures and no longer consolidate since the end of year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages acquired assets and businesses n a n a gulf liquids west southeast mid river ohio valley ethanol lower river louisiana all others including intrasegment eliminations and unallocated income tax expenses total terminals the overall increase in our terminals segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in versus was driven by incremental earnings from the terminal assets and businesses we acquired during combined  these acquired operations contributed incremental earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million and revenues of million in all of the incremental amounts represent the earnings and revenues from acquired terminals operations during the additional months of ownership in  and do not include increases or decreases during the same months we owned the assets in the prior year 
the earnings increase in compared to from our gulf liquids terminals was driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues  mainly due to new and incremental customer agreements at higher rates  and to the completion of various terminal expansion projects that increased liquids tank capacity since the end of for all liquids terminals combined  we increased our liquids leasable capacity by million barrels during and  at the same time  our overall liquids utilization capacity rate at the end of decreased by only since the prior year end

for compared to  the remaining million increase in expenses included increases of i million from higher employee benefit and payroll tax expenses  ii million from higher overall corporate insurance expenses  and iii million from higher unallocated legal expenses 
the increase in benefit and payroll tax expenses was mainly due to the overall variability in year over year health and medical costs  higher wage rates and a larger year over year labor force 
the increase in insurance expenses was primarily due to higher expense accruals in  related mainly to year over year increases in commercial property and liability insurance costs  and partly to incremental premium taxes 
the increase in legal expenses was primarily due to higher outside legal services

unallocable income tax expenses relate to corporate income tax accruals for the texas margin tax  an entity level tax imposed on the amount of our total revenue that is apportioned to the state of texas 
both the increase in expense  in  and the decrease in expense  in  was due to higher margin tax expense accruals in  relative to both and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  was essentially unchanged across both and the decrease in compared to was chiefly due to the higher net income allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the international marine terminals facility in  discussed above in terminals 
liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet included elsewhere in this report  an increase of million from december  we also had  as of december   approximately billion of borrowing capacity available under our billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below in short term liquidity 
we believe our cash position and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations  and currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate 
our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash which may result from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings including commercial paper issuances  and the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments  as such debt principal payments become due  with additional borrowings or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr 

table of content in addition to our results of operations  our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities  as discussed below in financing activities 
credit ratings and capital market liquidity as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and expansion activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
the major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate our outstanding debt  and our cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings 
currently  our long term corporate debt credit rating is bbb stable  baa negative and bbb stable  at standard poor s ratings services  moody s investors service  inc and fitch  inc  respectively 
on october   in response to kmi s announcement that it has reached an agreement to purchase of the outstanding stock of el paso corporation  moody s revised its outlook on our long term credit rating to negative from stable 
the rating agency s revision reflected its view that the increased leverage at kmi associated with this acquisition will put additional strain on us to upstream cash to kmi 
further information about this announcement is described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our short term corporate debt credit rating is a susceptible to adverse economic conditions  however  capacity to meet financial commitments is satisfactory  prime strong ability to repay short term debt obligations and f good quality grade with satisfactory capacity to meet financial commitments  at standard poor s ratings services  moody s investors service  inc and fitch  inc  respectively 
based on these credit ratings  we expect that our short term liquidity needs will be met primarily through borrowings under our commercial paper program 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our financing requirements or fund our planned capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy pipeline and terminals industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond our control 
additionally  some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience in the future  severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
these financial problems may arise from current global economic conditions  changes in commodity prices or otherwise 
we have been and are working to implement  to the extent allowable under applicable contracts  tariffs and regulations  prepayments and other security requirements  such as letters of credit  to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers 
we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our current or future financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  future results of operations  or future cash flows  however  we have no material concentrations of credit risk and we believe we have provided adequate allowance for such customers 
short term liquidity as of december   our principal sources of short term liquidity were i our billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a diverse syndicate of banks that matures july   ii our billion short term commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving credit facility  with the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility being reduced by our outstanding commercial paper borrowings and letters of credit  and iii cash from operations 
the loan commitments under our revolving credit facility can be used to fund borrowings for general partnership purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program 
the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to billion 
as of december   our credit facility was not drawn on  and as discussed above in general  we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our credit facility 
after reduction for i our outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program  and ii our outstanding letters of credit  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our credit facility was  million as of december  additionally  we have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations  providing a source of funds of  million in and  million in the year to year increase is discussed below in operating activities 
our outstanding short term debt as of december  was  million  primarily consisting of i million of commercial paper borrowings due in part to our short term credit rating upgrade in february  we made no short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility in  but instead made borrowings under our commercial paper program  ii million in principal amount of senior notes that mature march   and iii million in principal amount of senior notes that mature september  we intend to refinance our current short term debt through a combination of long term debt  equity  and or the issuance of additional commercial paper or credit facility borrowings to replace maturing commercial paper and current maturities of long term debt 

table of content we had working capital deficits of  million as of december  and  million as of december  the million unfavorable change from year end was primarily due to a million increase in short term debt  partially offset by the million increase in cash and cash equivalents discussed above in general 
the overall increase in short term debt was mainly due to the following i a million net increase in the current maturities of long term debt  and ii a million increase due to higher net commercial paper borrowings 
generally  our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments  timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables  the change in fair value of our derivative contracts  and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of debt or equity issuances discussed below in long term financing 
although working capital can be considered a measure of a company s ability to meet its short term cash needs  a working capital deficit is not unusual for us or for other companies similar in size and scope to us 
furthermore  we believe that our working capital deficit does not indicate a lack of liquidity as we continue to maintain adequate current assets and committed lines of credit to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due 
we employ a centralized cash management program for our us based bank accounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
however  our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and kmi has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement 
furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
long term financing in addition to our principal sources of short term liquidity listed above  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions of cash from operations to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner through issuing long term notes or additional common units  or by utilizing the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
our equity offerings consist of the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr which kmr purchases with the proceeds from the sale of additional kmr shares 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations  and we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
for more information on our and equity issuances  including cash proceeds received from both public offerings of common units and our equity distribution agreement  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
from time to time we issue long term debt securities  often referred to as our senior notes 
our senior notes issued to date  other than those issued by our subsidiaries and operating partnerships  generally have very similar terms  except for interest rates  maturity dates and prepayment premiums 
all of our outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations  however  a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries 
our fixed rate senior notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium 
for additional information on our debt securities and on our and debt related transactions  including our issuances of senior notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of content as of december  and december   the net carrying value of the various series of our senior notes was  million and  million  respectively  and the total liability balance due on the various borrowings of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries was million and million  respectively 
to date  our debt balances have not adversely affected our operations  our ability to grow or our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
based on our historical record  we believe that our capital structure will continue to allow us to achieve our business objectives 
we are subject  however  to conditions in the equity and debt markets for our limited partner units and long term senior notes  and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for our limited partner units and or long term senior notes in the future 
if we were unable or unwilling to issue additional limited partner units  we would be required to either restrict expansion capital expenditures and or potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our credit ratings 
furthermore  our ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by our credit ratings 
see credit ratings and capital market liquidity above for a discussion of our credit ratings 
capital structure we attempt to maintain a relatively conservative overall capital structure  financing our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with approximately equity and debt 
in the short term  we fund these expenditures from borrowings under our credit facility until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt  equity  or both 
with respect to our debt  we target a debt mixture of approximately fixed and variable interest rates 
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate interest payments 
capital expenditures we define sustaining capital expenditures as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  and for the year ended december   our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million 
this amount included million for our proportionate share of the sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc  ii midcontinent express pipeline llc  iii fayetteville express pipeline llc  iv cypress interstate pipeline llc  v eaglehawk field services llc  vi red cedar gathering company  and vii for the first six months of only  kinderhawk field services llc effective july   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in kinderhawk that we did not already own and we subsequently included its sustaining capital expenditures in our consolidated totals 
for the year ended december   our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million 
this amount included million for our proportionate share of the sustaining capital expenditures of i rockies express pipeline llc  ii midcontinent express pipeline llc  iii kinderhawk field services llc  iv cypress interstate pipeline llc  and v fayetteville express pipeline llc 
generally  we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash or from cash flows from operations 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from their own operations  rockies express  midcontinent express and fayetteville express can each fund their own cash requirements for expansion capital expenditures through borrowings under their own credit facilities  with proceeds from issuing their own long term notes  or with proceeds from contributions received from their member owners 
we have no contingent debt obligations with respect to rockies express  midcontinent express  or fayetteville express 
for information on our contingent debt obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have forecasted million for sustaining capital expenditures in our budget 
this amount includes million for our proportionate share of our equity investees sustaining capital expenditures 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are classified as discretionary 
our discretionary capital expenditures totaled million in and million in the year to year increase in discretionary capital expenditures was primarily due to higher investment undertaken in to expand and improve our products pipelines and co business segments 
generally  we initially fund our discretionary capital expenditures through borrowings under our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper program until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt  equity  or both 
we have forecasted  million for discretionary capital expenditures in our budget 
this amount does not include forecasted discretionary expenditures by our equity investees  forecasted capital contributions to our equity investees  or forecasted expenditures for asset acquisitions 

table of content capital contributions in addition to our discretionary capital expenditures  we contributed a combined million to our equity investees in our contributions included payments of million to our owned fayetteville express pipeline llc and combined payments of million to our two equity investees that gather natural gas located in the eagle ford shale formation in south texas our owned eagle ford gathering llc and our owned eaglehawk field services llc 
fayetteville express used the contributions to repay borrowings under its previous billion bank credit facility  and subsequently  entered into new borrowing facilities 
both eagle ford gathering and eaglehawk field services used our contributions as partial funding for natural gas gathering infrastructure expansions 
in  we made equity investment contributions of million 
our contributions primarily consisted of a combined million contributed to rockies express pipeline llc and midcontinent express pipeline llc to partially fund our respective share of rockies express and midcontinent express natural gas pipeline system construction costs 
fayetteville express funded its natural gas pipeline construction costs with borrowings under its own billion  unsecured revolving bank credit facility 
generally  we fund our equity investment contributions through borrowings under our commercial paper program or our bank credit facility 
to the extent these sources of funding are not sufficient  we generally fund additional amounts through the issuance of long term notes or common units for cash 
capital requirements for recent transactions for each of the years ended december  and  our net cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled  million and  million  respectively 
our cash payments for acquired assets and investments in included i million for both our remaining ownership interest in kinderhawk field services llc and our interest in eaglehawk field services llc  ii million for natural gas treating assets acquired from southtex treaters  inc  iii million for a preferred equity interest in watco companies  llc  and iv million for terminal assets acquired from tgs development  lp we also issued common units valued at million as consideration 
our cash outlays for strategic business acquisitions primarily consisted of i million for our initial ownership interest in kinderhawk  ii million for three unit train ethanol handling terminals acquired from us development group llc we also issued common units valued at million as consideration  and iii million for terminal assets and investments acquired from slay industries 
with the exception of the terminal assets which were partially acquired by the issuance of additional common units  we utilized our commercial paper program to fund our and acquisitions and then reduced our short term borrowings with the proceeds from our and equity and long term senior notes issuances

table of content item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
energy commodity market risk we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position  or anticipated position  in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard poor s ratings services credit rating j 
aron company goldman sachs a barclays a credit suisse a as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide us increased certainty with regard to our operating cash flows and helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income loss  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included within accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income portions attributable to our noncontrolling interests are included within noncontrolling interests and are not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 

table of content all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive income loss and noncontrolling interests and are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 
for more information on our other comprehensive income loss and our accumulated other comprehensive income loss  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure estimating the probability of portfolio losses over a given holding period  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a quarterly basis 
our value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement  and we choose a holding period of one day for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
for each of the years ended december  and  our value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our combined portfolio of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options and corresponding physical commodities assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into our derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore both in the value at risk calculation and in reality  the change in the market value of our derivative contracts portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions

interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
generally  we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed following  was million as of december  and million as of december  
table of content as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately basis points in and basis points in  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described above  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of both december  and  all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of both december  and  our cash and investment portfolio included million in fixed income debt securities 
these amounts are included within investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at each reporting date and are not material to our consolidated balance sheets
