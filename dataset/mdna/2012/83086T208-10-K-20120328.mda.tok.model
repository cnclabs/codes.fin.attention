table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the production and sales of fruit juice concentrates including fruit purees  concentrated fruit purees and concentrated fruit juices  fruit beverages including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages  and other fruit related products including organic and non organic fresh fruits in and from the prc 
our fruit juice concentrates  which include apple  pear and kiwifruit concentrates  are sold to domestic customers and exported directly or via distributors 
we sell our hedetang branded bottled fruit beverages domestically primarily to supermarkets in the prc 
in  sales of our fruit concentrates  fruit beverages  fresh fruits and other fruit related products represented   and of our revenue  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  in we export our products as well as sell them domestically 
we sell our products either through distributors with good credit or to end users directly 
in and  we believe export of our products represented and of our revenues  respectively 
we believe that our main export markets are the united states  the european union  south korea  russia and the middle east 
we sell our hedetang brand bottled fruit beverages domestically  primarily to supermarkets in the prc 
we sell our other fruit related products to domestic customers 
we currently market our hedetang brand fruit beverages in only certain regions of the prc 
we plan to expand the market presence of hedetang over a broader geographic area in the prc 
in particular  we plan to expand our glass bottle production line to produce higher margin portable fruit juice beverages targeting consumers in more populated chinese cities 
currently we produce six flavors of fruit beverages in ml glass bottles and ml glass bottles  including apple juice  pear juice  kiwifruit juice  mulberry juice  kiwifruit cider and mulberry cider 
we currently sell our fruit beverages to over distributors and more than  retails stores in approximately provinces 
our products are sold through distributors in stores such as wal mart stores in beijing  wal mart stores in xi an and carrefour in shanghai 
we plan to continue to focus on creating new products with high margins to supplement our current product offering 
we believe that continuous investment in research and development is a key component to being a leader in fruit juice concentrate and fruit beverage quality 
as of december   we had an internal research and development team of approximately employees  and we retain external experts and research institutions for additional consultation when necessary 
in and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively 
our business is highly seasonal and can be greatly affected by weather because of the seasonal nature in the growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables 
our core products are apple  pear and kiwifruit juice concentrates  which are produced from july or august to april of the following year 
the squeezing season for i apples is from august to january or february  ii pears is from july or august until april of next year  and iii kiwifruit is from september through december 
typically  a substantial portion of our revenues is earned during our first and fourth quarters 
to minimize the seasonality of our business  we make continued efforts in identifying new products with harvesting seasons complementary to our current product mix 
our goal is to lengthen our squeezing season  thus increasing our annual production of fruit juice concentrates and fruit beverages 
in the first quarter of  we introduced mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages in the chinese market 
unlike fruit juice concentrates  which can only be produced during the squeezing season  such fruit beverages are made out of fruit juice concentrates and can be produced and sold in all seasons 
with continuous efforts in marketing of our beverages in domestic market  we believe that our seasonality will be reduced 

table of contents fresh fruits are the primary raw materials needed for the production of our products 
our raw materials mainly consist of apples  pears and kiwifruits 
other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme  amylase  auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal  electricity and water 
we purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants 
we have implemented a fruit purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories 
in addition  we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas  helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner 
we are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production 
we have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel 
our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile in china 
fruit concentrate and fruit juice beverage companies generally do not enter into purchasing agreements 
in addition to raw materials  we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners  glass and plastic bottles  cans and packing barrels 
we generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers 
shaanxi and liaoning provinces  where our manufacturing facilities are located  are large fruit producing provinces 
we own and operate four manufacturing facilities in the prc  all of which are strategically located near fruit growing centers so that we can better preserve the freshness of the fruits and lower our transportation costs 
to take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance our production efficiency  generally  each of our manufacturing facilities has a focus on products made from one particular fruit according to the proximity of such manufacturing to the sources of supply for that fruit 
our kiwifruit processing facilities are located in zhouzhi county of shaanxi province  which has the largest planting area of apples and kiwifruit in the prc 
our pear processing facilities are located in shaanxi province  which is the main pear producing province in the prc 
our apple processing facilities are located in liaoning province  a region that abounds with high acidity apples 
as we use the same production line for concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice and both shaanxi province and liaoning province are rich in fresh apple and pear production  our liaoning facilities also produced concentrated apple juice and our shaanxi province facilities also produced concentrated apple juice based on customer need 
we believe that these regions provide adequate supply of raw materials for our production needs in the foreseeable future 
on august   we closed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for approximately million 
we received an aggregate of approximately million as net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
as of december   we had spent approximately million on various capital projects in huludao wonder as described in projects and below 
the following table presents the capital projects on which we currently plan to use the proceeds from this offering 
we review these projects and capital expenditures on a quarterly basis based on the market conditions and associated costs of these projects 

table of contents huludao wonder projects subsidiary no 
priority projects progress estimated capital expenditure in millions huludao wonder construction of a refrigeration storage unit for the storage of concentrated fruit juices and fresh fruits and vegetables the design of the facility has been completed 
construction has been delayed due to change of plan 
new plan is to build such refrigeration storage unit in a new location in a suizhong of liaoning province 
the company is now in the progress of evaluating the changes to the plan and in negotiation with local government to acquire land usage right of block of land of the new location 
it is expected that the construction of such refrigeration storage will start in the second quarter of huludao wonder construction of concentrated fruit juice mixing center the design of the facility has been completed 
it is expected that construction of such mixing center will start in the second quarter of huludao wonder construction of a ton hour comprehensive fruits and vegetables processing line construction delayed due to extreme weather condition 
it is expected construction work will start in the second quarter of huludao wonder construction of a fruit juice beverage production line of  bottles hour the construction of such production line has been substantially finished 
trail operation of the new production line has been conducted 
we are in the process of applying relevant government approvals 
huludao wonder environmental project waste water treatment facility for concentrated apple juice production line the construction of such environmental project has been substantially finished 
total capital expenditure 
table of contents our initial plan was to construct both the refrigeration storage see above and fruit juice mixing center see above in huludao wonder  for which original estimation of total capital expenditure was million 
we initially planned to start the construction of the refrigeration storage unit for the storage of concentrated fruit juices and fresh fruits and vegetables and a concentrated fruit juice mixing center in the fourth quarter of however  the construction of refrigeration storage unit has been delayed due to a change of plan 
management concluded that it is in the best interest of the company to build the refrigeration storage unit in suizhong  liaoning province 
the total estimated capital expenditure for and based on the changed plan would be million 
the company is now in the process of evaluating the new plan and in negotiation with the local government to acquire land usage right for the new location 
if the company is able to acquire the land use right at terms acceptable to the company  it is expected that the construction of such refrigeration storage would start during the second quarter of the fruit juice mixing center will be built in huludao wonder 
the design of the fruit juice mixing center has been completed 
it is expected that construction of such mixing center would start in the second quarter of our initial plan was to construct a ton hour concentrated apple juice production line in huludao wonder 
on march   the national development and reform commission and the relevant departments of the state council of the prc amended the catalogue of industry structure adjustment issued in and released the catalogue of industry structure adjustment for the new catalogue  which was effective on june  in the new catalogue  concentrated apple juice business is classified in the category of restricted industry  which means that the government may restrict the expansion of this industry by  among other things  putting limitations on the increase in production capacity  increasing the product quality standard  reducing government financial support 
we expect the restrictions under the new catalogue will reduce government financial support of concentrated apple juice businesses and have a negative impact on the future expansion and development of our concentrated apple juice segment 
considering the government potential restriction on the approval of increase in the production capacity of concentrated apple juice  we decided to cancel our original plan for the construction of a ton hour concentrated apple juice line  which we previously estimated to use up to million of the proceeds generated from our public financing consummated in august we are currently considering other different potential projects for our huludao wonder factory 
in addition  to minimize the potential negative impact of the new regulation  we planned to change our existing ton hour concentrated apple juice line into a ton hour comprehensive fruits and vegetables processing line by adding additional equipment and machinery 
the ton hour comprehensive fruits and vegetables processing line is expected to process a variety of fruits and vegetables including apple  pear  and other fruits and vegetables into juices 
the estimated investment for this project is million 
we believe that this project could provide us more flexibility 
due to extreme weather conditions  the construction of this ton hour comprehensive fruits and vegetables processing line has been delayed 
it is expected that construction of the project would start in the second quarter of we started the construction of infrastructure for the fruit juice beverage production line on september  the construction of a fruit juice beverage production line with maximum production capacity of  bottles per hour has been substantially finished 
trail operation of the new production line has been conducted 
the company is in the process of applying relevant government approvals 
the environmental project mainly consists of a wastewater processing facility that is required in our production of fruit and vegetable juice concentrates 
the construction of environmental project waste water treatment facility for concentrated apple juice production line has been substantially finished 
shaanxi qiyiwangguo projects we previously identified several projects for our shaanxi qiyiwangguo factory  which we expect to finance using our operating cash flow 
these projects including a  pet bottle hour fruit juice beverage aseptic cold filling line  and a pet bottle blowing machine system 
based on the current market conditions and other potential opportunities  management has decided to delay these projects to a future date when appropriate 
other projects we added another tons per hour concentrated pear juice line in production facility in jingyang branch office of skypeople china using the cash generated from operating cash flows 
as of december   the construction of such production line had completed 
the newly production has started operation 
the company invested approximately million in this project  including million purchasing machinery and equipment and million in construction of the project 

table of contents key components of operating results sources of revenue we derive our revenue primarily from the sales of fruit juice concentrates  fruit beverages and other fruit related products in and from the prc 
our fruit juice concentrates  which include apple  pear and kiwifruit  are sold directly or indirectly to domestic juice manufacturers and exported primarily via distributors to north america  europe  russia  south korea and the middle east 
our general sales agreement with distributors requires that the distributors pay us after we deliver our products to them  which is not contingent on resale to end users 
our credit terms for distributors with good credit history are from days to days 
distributors have no contractual right to return our products and we are not required to rebate or credit any amounts paid if we subsequently reduce the price of our products 
we sell our hedetang branded bottled fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages domestically primarily to supermarkets in the prc 
in addition to concentrated juice products and juice beverages  we generate other revenue from sales of apple spice  kiwifruit seeds and fresh kiwifruit 
these products are mainly sold to chinese customers 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost for raw materials  including various fresh fruit  packing barrels  pectic enzyme  amylase  auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal  electricity and water  bottles  packaging materials  and expenses associated with the operations of our manufacturing facilities 
we determine cost of sales on the basis of the average cost of inventory methods 
for purposes of determining our cost of sales of kiwifruit seeds  we apply the relative sales value costing method 
in calculating the gross margin of kiwifruit seeds  we applied the weighted average method to simplify the calculation 
in applying this method  we first calculated the average revenue of kiwifruit seeds and kiwifruit juice that can be produced from one ton of kiwifruit  based on our estimate in a normal production situation in the applicable period 
this percentage is then applied to actual cost for the production of kiwifruit juice to calculate the actual cost of sales for kiwifruit seeds and concentrated kiwifruit juice in the period covered by the financial statements 
the shipping and handling expenses of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  are reported in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income as a component of selling expenses 
the largest component of our cost of sales is the cost for fresh fruit 
we purchase fresh fruit and other raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants 
our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile 
we generally do not enter into long term purchase agreements for fresh fruit 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories general and administrative  selling and research and development 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  which include salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and employee benefit costs 
other expenses include advertising and promotional costs  shipping and handling costs not billed to customers  facilities costs and legal  audit  tax  consulting and other professional service fees 
the government owns all of the land in the prc 
companies or individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only through land use rights granted by the prc government 
accordingly  we paid for land use rights in advance and such prepayments are being amortized and recorded as expenses using the straight line method over the use terms of the lease  which are to years 
the amortization expenses were  and  for and  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  legal  audit  tax and other professional fees  depreciation expenses  insurance and other corporate expenses 
selling expenses selling expenses consist primarily of freight and transportation expenses  advertising and promotional costs and personnel costs for our sales team 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our employees and use of outside consultants 
we have focused our research and development on developing and producing innovative high margin products to further diversify our product mix 
we routinely enter into research and development agreements with outside research institutes 
currently  we have agreements with shaanxi university of science technology  shaanxi research institute of agricultural products processing technology and northwest agriculture forestry university  respectively 
the following table sets forth the three research and development contracts that are currently in effect

table of contents provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits earned in the prc from sales of our products 
prior to  we were subject to an income tax rate of in the prc 
in december  skypeople china was awarded the status of a nationally recognized high and new technology enterprise  which entitled skypeople china to tax free treatment from january to december starting in january  skypeople china was subject to the regular tax rate of 
the tax rate of shaanxi qiyiwangguo  was reduced from to  effective january the tax rate of huludao wonder was also reduced to  effective january yingkou commenced operation in the fourth quarter of and was subject to a tax rate of 
our consolidated income tax rates were effectively in both and our income tax expenses are comprised of us and china tax accrual as computed using the tax rules and regulations for such jurisdictions 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  topic  we evaluate material tax positions asserted on every income tax return for the technical merits as to the tax supportability under examination or tax litigation 
when we determine that a tax position is uncertain  our policy is to record a liability based on whether the tax position s facts and circumstances on a more likely than not basis are supportable under tax laws and regulations 
we have had no material adjustments to the unrecognized income tax benefits since our adoption of fasb asc critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following reflects the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure at contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  estimated useful life and residual value of property  plant and equipment  provision for staff benefit  valuation of change in fair value of warrant liability  recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of skypeople  pacific  skypeople international  hmn  skypeople china  shaanxi qiyiwangguo  huludao wonder  and yingkou 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the pooling of interest method entities under common control is applied to the consolidation of pacific with skypeople china and skypeople china 
the reverse acquisition accounting is applied to the consolidation of skypeople and pacific 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this basis differs from that used in the statutory accounts of skypeople china  shaanxi qiyiwangguo  huludao wonder and yingkou  which were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and relevant financial regulations applicable to enterprises in the prc 
all necessary adjustments have been made to present the financial statements in accordance with us gaap 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments the company discloses financial instruments at estimated fair values pursuant to fasb accounting standards codification topic on fair value measurements and disclosures asc

revenue from sales of products is recognized upon shipment or delivery to customers  provided that persuasive evidence of sales arrangements exist  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customers  the sales amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
customers have no contractual right to return products 
historically  the company has not had any returned products 
accordingly  no provision has been made for returnable goods 
the company is not required to rebate or credit a portion of the original fee if it subsequently reduces the price of its product and the distributor still has rights with respect to that product 
foreign currency and comprehensive income the financial statements of the company s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency  however  the functional currency and the reporting currency of the company are the united states dollar usd 
assets and liabilities of the company s foreign subsidiaries have been translated into usd using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date  while equity accounts are translated using historical exchange rate 
the average exchange rate for the period has been used to translate revenues and expenses 
translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in a separate component of equity cumulative translation adjustment 
other comprehensive income for the year ended december  and represented foreign currency translation adjustments and were included in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
there is no guarantee the rmb amounts could have been  or could be  converted into usd at rates used in translation 
income taxes income taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes

deferred income tax liabilities or assets are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the financial reporting amounts at each period end 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
asc provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions  and it prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides accounting guidance on derecognizing  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the fasb asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
it is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other industrial changes 
determination of recoverability of assets to be held and used is by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the reporting period there was no impairment loss 
accounts receivable accounts receivable and other receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amount 
allowance is made when collection of the full amount is expected no longer probable

gross margin for concentrated apple juice and apple aroma decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily caused by the higher price of fresh apple 
gross margin for concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree also decreased from in to in during  due to unexpected weather conditions  the harvest season for kiwifruits was delayed from september to mid october which in turn delayed our squeezing season for kiwifruits 
in addition  the delayed harvest of kiwifruits led to reduced supply of kiwifruits in the fourth quarter which raised the cost of fresh kiwifruits in the market 
as a result  our gross margin for concentrated kiwifruit juice dropped 
gross margin for concentrated pear juice decreased from in to in the decrease was mainly caused by higher raw material price of fresh pear
