item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the part i  item a risks factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative products that advance patient care 
our research targets the extracellular matrix  an area outside the cell that provides structural support in tissues and orchestrates many important biological activities  including cell migration  signaling and survival 
over many years  we have developed unique scientific expertise that allows us to pursue this target rich environment for the development of future therapies 

table of contents our research focuses primarily on human enzymes that alter the extracellular matrix 
our lead enzyme  the recombinant human hyaluronidase  or rhuph  temporarily degrades hyaluronan  or ha  a matrix component in the skin  and facilitates the dispersion and absorption of drugs and fluids 
we are also developing novel enzymes that may target other matrix structures for therapeutic benefit 
our enhanze technology is the platform for the delivery of proprietary small and large molecules 
we apply our research to develop products in partnership with other companies as well as for our own proprietary pipeline in therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical need  such as diabetes  oncology and dermatology 
our operations to date have involved i organizing and staffing our operating subsidiary  halozyme  inc  ii acquiring  developing and securing our technology  iii undertaking product development for our existing products and a limited number of product candidates  iv supporting the development of partnered product candidates  and v selling hylenex recombinant hyaluronidase human injection 
we continue to increase our focus on our proprietary product pipeline and have expanded investments in our proprietary product candidates 
we currently have multiple proprietary programs in various stages of research and development 
in addition  we currently have collaborative partnerships with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd and hoffmann la roche  inc  or roche  baxter healthcare corporation  or baxter  viropharma incorporated  or viropharma  and intrexon corporation  or intrexon  to apply enhanze technology to the partners biological therapeutic compounds 
we also had another partnership with baxter  under which baxter had worldwide marketing rights for our marketed product  hylenex recombinant  or the hylenex partnership 
we and baxter mutually agreed to terminate the hylenex partnership in january currently  we have received only limited revenue from the sales of hylenex recombinant  in addition to other revenues from our partnerships 
we and our partners have product candidates in the research  preclinical and clinical stages  but future revenues from the sales and or royalties of these product candidates will depend on our partners abilities and ours to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize product candidates 
it may be years  if ever  before we and our partners are able to obtain regulatory approvals for these product candidates 
we have incurred net operating losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we are currently a well known seasoned issuer and may file automatic shelf registration statements at any time with the sec 
in february  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
with the sec  which allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell equity  debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units 
on february   we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating approximately million in proceeds after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions but before any deductions for expenses 
we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
revenues we generate revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
revenue from product sales depends on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our products and product candidates 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable payments at the inception of the arrangement  license fees  exclusivity fees  payments based on achievement of specified milestones designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services  payments for the manufacture of bulk formulation of rhuph active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api for the partner and or royalties  as applicable  on sales of products resulting from collaborative agreements 
we analyze each element of our collaborative agreements and consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue under collaborative agreements below for our revenue recognition policies for payments received under collaborative agreements 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  freight costs  internal costs and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of our products 
cost of sales also consists of the write down of excess  dated and obsolete inventories 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  research related manufacturing services  clinical trials  contract research services  supplies and materials  facilities and other overhead costs and other outside expenses 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates 
since our inception in through december   we have incurred research and development expenses of million 
from january  through december   approximately and of our research and development expenses were associated with the development of our analog ph and pegph product candidates  respectively 
research and development expenses incurred for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  programs product candidates analog ph pegph hti hylenex recombinant enhanze partnerships rhuph platform other total research and development expenses includes research  development and manufacturing expenses related to our proprietary recombinant human ph enzyme  rhuph these expenses were not designated to a specific program at the time the expenses were incurred 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining the u 
s food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals  our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our product candidates advance into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make ongoing determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to existing resource levels  the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate  and other market and regulatory developments 
we plan on focusing our resources on those proprietary and partnered product candidates that represent the most valuable economic and strategic opportunities 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  
table of contents have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  or if  our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a 
through the second quarter of  our selling expenses  which include sales and marketing costs  primarily consisted of compensation  consulting fees  costs of market research studies related to our product and product candidates 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we expanded our commercial infrastructure  including hiring of sales and marketing management and sales representatives 
in addition  we began incurring costs related to advertising  marketing and logistics services for hylenex recombinant in connection with the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  accounting and legal fees  other professional services expenses  as well as other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable fees at the inception of the agreements  license fees  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales hylenex recombinant was approved for marketing by the fda in december from through january   baxter had the worldwide market rights for hylenex recombinant under the terms of the hylenex partnership 
baxter commercially launched hylenex recombinant in october however  hylenex recombinant was voluntarily recalled in may because a portion of the product manufactured by baxter was not in compliance with the requirements of the underlying partnership 
effective january   we and baxter mutually agreed to terminate the hylenex partnership 
during the second quarter of  we submitted the data that the fda had requested to support the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant to the market 
the fda approved the submitted data and granted the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant 

table of contents in december  we reintroduced hylenex recombinant to the market  shipped initial stocking orders to its wholesaler customers and began promoting hylenex recombinant through our sales force 
we sell hylenex recombinant in the united states to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors  who in turn sell the product to hospitals and other end user customers 
the wholesale distributors take title to the product  bear the risk of loss of ownership and have economic substance to the inventory 
further  we have no significant obligations for future performance to generate pull through sales  however  we do allow the wholesale distributors to return product that is damaged or received in error 
in addition  we allow for product to be returned beginning six months prior to and ending twelve months following product expiration 
given our limited experience history of selling hylenex recombinant and the lengthy return period  we currently cannot reliably estimate expected returns and chargebacks of hylenex recombinant at the time of product received by the wholesale distributors 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue upon delivery of hylenex recombinant to the wholesale distributor until the point at which we can reliably estimate expected product returns and chargebacks from the wholesale distributors 
shipments of hylenex recombinant are recorded as deferred revenue until evidence exists to confirm that pull through sales to the hospitals or other end user customers have occurred 
we recognize revenue when the product is sold through from the distributors to the distributors customers 
in addition  the costs of manufacturing hylenex recombinant associated with the deferred revenue are recorded as deferred costs  which are included in inventory  until such time as the related deferred revenue is recognized 
we estimate sell through revenue and certain gross to net sales adjustments based on analysis of third party information including information obtained from certain distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to the distributors customers 
at the time the company can reliably estimate product returns and chargebacks from the wholesalers  we will record a one time increase in net product sales revenue related to the recognition of product sales revenue previously deferred 
we recognize product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
product sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with wholesaler customers  hospitals and the levels of inventory within the distribution channels that may result in future discounts taken 
we must make significant judgments in determining these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustment to these allowances in the future  which could have an effect on product sales revenue in the period of adjustment 
our product sales allowances include distribution fees 
the distribution fees  based on contractually determined rates  arise from contractual agreements we have with certain wholesale distributors for distribution services they provide with respect to hylenex recombinant 
at the time the sale is made to the respective wholesale distributors  we record an allowance for distribution fees by reducing our accounts receivable and deferred revenue associated with such product sales 
prompt payment discounts 
we offer cash discounts to certain wholesale distributors as an incentive to meet certain payment terms 
at the time the sale is made to the respective wholesale distributors  we record an allowance for distribution fees by reducing our accounts receivable and deferred revenue associated with such product sales 
chargebacks 
we provide discounts to certain hospitals 
these hospitals purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price  and the wholesale distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the price the hospitals paid for the product 
given our lack of historical sales data  we recognize chargebacks in the same period the related product sales revenue is recognized and reduce our accounts receivable accordingly 
product returns 
the product return reserve is based on management s best estimate of the product sales recognized as revenue during the period that are anticipated to be returned 
the product returns reserve is recorded as a reduction of product sales revenue in the same period the related product sales revenue is recognized and is included in accrued expenses 

table of contents prior to the termination of the hylenex partnership with baxter in january  we supplied baxter with api for hylenex recombinant at our fully burdened cost plus a margin 
baxter filled and finished hylenex recombinant and held it for subsequent distribution  at which time we ensured it met product specifications and released it as available for sale 
because of our continued involvement in the development and production process of hylenex recombinant  the earnings process was not considered to be complete 
accordingly  we deferred the revenue and related product costs on the api for hylenex recombinant until the product was filled  finished  packaged and released 
baxter could only return the api for hylenex recombinant to us if it did not conform to the specified criteria set forth in the hylenex partnership or upon termination of such agreement 
in addition  we received product based payments upon the sale of hylenex recombinant by baxter  in accordance with the terms of the hylenex partnership 
product based revenues were recognized as we earned such revenues based on baxter s shipments of hylenex recombinant to its distributors when such amounts could be reasonably estimated 
revenues under collaborative agreements we entered into license and collaboration agreements under which the collaborative partners obtained worldwide exclusive rights for the use of our proprietary rhuph enzyme in the development and commercialization of the partners biologic compounds 
the collaborative agreements contain multiple elements including nonrefundable payments at the inception of the arrangement  license fees  exclusivity fees  payments based on achievement of specified milestones designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services  payments for supply of rhuph api for the partner and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative agreements 
we analyze each element of the collaborative agreements and consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition of each element 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  on january   in order for a delivered item to be accounted for separately from other deliverables in a multiple element arrangement  the following three criteria had to be met i the delivered item had standalone value to the customer  ii there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items and iii if the arrangement included a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items was considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
for the collaborative agreements entered into prior to january   there was no objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
thus  the delivered licenses did not meet all of the required criteria to be accounted for separately from undelivered items 
therefore  we recognize revenue on nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees from these collaborative agreements over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements 
for new collaborative agreements or material modifications of existing collaborative agreements entered into after december   we follow the provisions of asu no 
in order to account for the multiple element arrangements  we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent units of accounting 
analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment  and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver services  a right or license to use an asset  or another performance obligation 
the deliverables under our collaborative agreements include i the license to rhuph technology  ii at the collaborator s request  research and development services which are reimbursed at contractually determined rates  and iii at the collaborator s request  supply of rhuph api which is reimbursed at our cost plus a margin 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
factors considered in this determination include the research capabilities of the partner and the availability of research expertise in this field in the general marketplace 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not 
table of contents exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
upfront license fee payments are recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered items  which generally include research and development services and the manufacture of rhuph api  the relative selling price allocation of the license is equal to or exceeds the upfront license fee  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the partner is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
upfront license fee payments are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
the terms of our collaborative agreements provide for milestone payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory events and or specified sales volumes of commercialized products by the collaborator 
prior to our adoption of the milestone method of revenue recognition  or the milestone method  we recognized milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone was substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the fees were nonrefundable and our performance obligations after the milestone achievement would continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
effective january   we adopted on a prospective basis the milestone method 
under the milestone method  we recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the vendor 
reimbursements of research and development services are recognized as revenue during the period in which the services are performed as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from the manufacture of rhuph api is recognized when the api has met all specifications required for the collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
we do not directly control when any collaborator will request research and development services or supply of rhuph api  therefore  we cannot predict when we will recognize revenues in connection with research and development services and supply of rhuph api 
royalties to be received based on sales of licensed products by our collaborators incorporating rhuph will be recognized as earned 
the collaborative agreements typically provide the partners the right to terminate such agreement in whole or on a product by product or target by target basis at any time upon days prior written notice to us 
there are 
table of contents no performance  cancellation  termination or refund provisions in any of our collaborative agreements that contain material financial consequences to us 
roche partnership in december  we and roche entered into an agreement under which roche obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with up to thirteen roche target compounds  or the roche partnership 
under the terms of the roche partnership  roche paid million as an initial upfront license fee for the application of rhuph to three pre defined roche biologic targets 
due to our continuing involvement obligations for example  support activities associated with rhuph enzyme  revenues from the upfront payment  exclusive designation fees and annual license maintenance fees were deferred and are being recognized over the term of the roche partnership 
as of december   we have received million from roche  including the million upfront license fee payment and million in clinical development milestone payments 
if roche successfully develops all of the three pre defined targets and achieves pre agreed sales targets  we could receive additional milestone payments of up to million  including up to million for the achievement of clinical development milestones  up to million for the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to million for the achievement of sales based milestones 
we will earn the next milestone payment of million when roche submits a biologic license application of one of the three pre defined targets 
under the terms of the roche partnership  roche will also pay us royalties on product sales for these first three targets 
for each of the additional targets  roche may pay us further upfront and milestone payments of up to million per target  as well as royalties on product sales  for each of the additional targets 
additionally  roche will obtain access to our expertise in developing and applying rhuph to roche targets 
through december   roche has paid an aggregate of million in connection with its election of two additional exclusive targets and annual license maintenance fees for the right to designate the remaining targets as exclusive targets 
in  roche paid the annual license maintenance fees on only three of the remaining eight target slots 
in  roche did not pay the annual exclusivity maintenance fee for any of the remaining additional target slots 
as a result  roche currently retains the option to develop and commercialize rhuph with only three additional targets under the roche partnership agreement  provided that it continues to pay annual maintenance fees to us 
we have determined that the clinical and regulatory milestones are substantive  therefore  we expect to recognize such clinical and regulatory milestone payments as revenue upon achievement 
in addition  we have determined that the sales based milestone payments are similar to royalty payments and are not considered milestone payments under the milestone method of revenue recognition  therefore  we will recognize such sales based milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue under collaborative agreements in accordance with the milestone method related to the achievement of certain clinical milestones pursuant to the terms of the roche partnership 
we recognized zero and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as revenue under collaborative agreements upon achievement of certain clinical milestones pursuant to the terms of the roche partnership 
in early march  we announced that roche has submitted a line extension application to the european medicines agency for herceptin formulated with rhuph subcutaneous herceptin 
upon achievement of this milestone  we are entitled to receive a milestone payment of million in the first half of gammagard partnership in september  we entered into an agreement with baxter  under which baxter obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph  with a current baxter product  gammagard liquid  or the gammagard partnership 
under the terms of the gammagard partnership  baxter paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of million 
due to our continuing 
table of contents involvement obligation for example  support activities associated with rhuph enzyme  the million upfront payment was deferred and is being recognized over the term of the gammagard partnership 
as of december   we have received million under the gammagard partnership  including the million upfront license fee payment and million in regulatory milestone payment 
if baxter successfully receives marketing approval for the licensed product candidate and achieves pre agreed sales targets  we could receive additional milestone payments of up to million for the achievement of sales based milestones 
in addition  baxter will pay royalties on the sales  if any  of the products that result from the collaboration 
the gammagard partnership is applicable to both kit and formulation combinations 
baxter assumes all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs under the gammagard partnership  while we are responsible for the supply of the rhuph enzyme 
we perform research and development activities at the request of baxter  which are reimbursed by baxter under the terms of the gammagard partnership 
in addition  baxter has certain product development and commercialization obligations in major markets identified in the gammagard partnership 
we have determined that the regulatory milestones are substantive  therefore  we expect to recognize such regulatory milestone payments as revenue upon achievement 
in addition  we have determined that sales based milestone payments are similar to royalty payments and are not considered milestone payments under the milestone method of revenue recognition  therefore  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million as revenue under collaborative agreements in accordance with the milestone method related to the achievement of regulatory milestones pursuant to the terms of the gammagard partnership 
there were no milestone payments recognized as revenue under the terms of the gammagard partnership for the years ended december  and viropharma and intrexon partnerships effective may   we and viropharma entered into a collaboration and agreement  under which viropharma obtained a worldwide exclusive license for the use of rhuph enzyme in the development of a subcutaneous injectable formulation of viropharma s commercialized product  cinryze c esterase inhibitor 
human  or the viropharma partnership 
in addition  the license provides viropharma with exclusivity to c esterase inhibitor and to the hereditary angioedema indication  along with three additional orphan indications 
as of december   we have received million from viropharma  including the million nonrefundable upfront license fee payment and million in clinical development milestone payment 
if viropharma successfully develops the licensed product candidate  we could receive additional milestone payments of up to million for the achievement of development and regulatory milestones 
in addition  so long as the agreement is in effect  we are entitled to receive an annual exclusivity fee of million commencing on may  and on each anniversary of the effective date of the agreement thereafter until a certain development event occurs 
viropharma is solely responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of any products resulting from this partnership 
we are entitled to receive payments for research and development services and supply of rhuph api if requested by viropharma 
in addition  we are entitled to receive additional cash payments potentially totaling million for each product for treatment of each of the three additional orphan indications upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on product sales by viropharma 
viropharma may terminate the agreement prior to expiration for any reason on a product by product basis upon days prior written notice to us 
upon any such termination  the license granted to viropharma in total or with respect to the terminated product  as applicable will terminate 
effective june   we and intrexon entered into a collaboration and agreement  under which intrexon obtained a worldwide exclusive license for the use of rhuph enzyme in the development of a subcutaneous injectable formulation of intrexon s recombinant human alpha antitrypsin rhuaat  or the intrexon partnership 
in addition  the license provides intrexon with exclusivity for a defined indication exclusive field 
as of december   we have received million in nonrefundable upfront license fee payment from intrexon 
if intrexon successfully develops the licensed product candidate and achieves the pre agreed sales target  we could receive additional milestone payments of up to million  including million for the 
table of contents achievement of development and regulatory milestones and million for the achievement of a sales based milestone 
in addition  so long as the agreement is in effect  we are entitled to receive an annual exclusivity fee of million commencing on june  and on each anniversary of the effective date of the agreement thereafter until a certain development event occurs 
intrexon is solely responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of any products resulting from this partnership 
we are entitled to receive payments for research and development services and supply of rhuph api if requested by intrexon 
in addition  we are entitled to receive additional cash payments potentially totaling million for each product for use outside the exclusive field upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on product sales at a royalty rate which increases with net sales of product 
intrexon may terminate the agreement prior to expiration for any reason on a product by product basis upon days prior written notice to us 
upon any such termination  the license granted to intrexon in total or with respect to the terminated product  as applicable will terminate 
intrexon s chief executive officer and chairman of its board of directors is also a member of the company s board of directors 
we identified the deliverables at the inception of the viropharma and intrexon partnerships which are the license  research and development services and api supply 
we have determined that the license  research and development services and api supply individually represent separate units of accounting  because each deliverable has standalone value 
the estimated selling prices for these units of accounting was determined based on market conditions  the terms of comparable collaborative arrangements for similar technology in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry and entity specific factors such as the terms of our previous collaborative agreements  our pricing practices and pricing objectives and the nature of the research and development services to be performed for the partners 
the arrangement consideration was allocated to the deliverables based on the relative selling price method 
based on the results of our analysis  we determined that the upfront payment was earned upon the granting of the worldwide exclusive right to our technology to the collaborator in both the viropharma partnership and intrexon partnership 
however  the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable  therefore  the amount allocated to the license was only to the extent of cash received 
as a result  we recognized the million upfront license fee received under the viropharma partnership and million upfront license fee received under the intrexon partnership as revenues under collaborative agreements upon the receipt of such upfront license fees for the year ended december  we will recognize the exclusivity fees as revenue under collaborative agreements when they are earned 
we will recognize reimbursements for research and development services as revenue under collaborative agreements as the related services are delivered 
we will recognize payments from sales of api as revenue under collaborative agreements when such api has met all required specifications by the partners and the related title and risk of loss and damages have passed to the partners 
we cannot predict the timing of delivery of research and development services and api as they are at the partners requests 
we are eligible to receive additional cash payments upon the achievement by the partners of specified development  regulatory and sales based milestones 
we have determined that each of the development and regulatory milestones is substantive  therefore  we expect to recognize such development and regulatory milestone payments as revenue under collaborative agreements upon achievement in accordance with the milestone method 
in addition  we have determined that the sales based milestone payment is similar to a royalty payment and is not considered milestone payment under the milestone method of revenue recognition  therefore  we will recognize the sales based milestone payment as revenue upon achievement of the milestone because we have no future performance obligations associated with the milestone 
for the year ended december   we recognized the million payment from viropharma as revenue under collaborative agreements in accordance with the milestone method related to the achievement of a regulatory milestone pursuant to the terms of the viropharma partnership 

table of contents hylenex partnership under the terms of the hylenex partnership  baxter paid us a nonrefundable upfront payment of million in due to our continuing involvement obligations for example  support activities associated with rhuph enzyme  the million upfront payment was deferred and was being recognized over the term of the hylenex partnership 
effective january   we and baxter mutually agreed to terminate the hylenex partnership and the associated agreements 
the termination of these agreements does not affect the other relationships between the parties  including the application of our enhanze technology to baxter s gammagard liquid 
on july   we and baxter entered into an agreement  or the transition agreement  setting forth certain rights  data and assets to be transferred by baxter to us during a transition period 
effective july   we had no future performance obligations to baxter in connection with the hylenex partnership 
therefore  we recognized the unamortized deferred revenue of approximately million relating to the prepaid product based payments and the unamortized deferred revenue of approximately million relating to deferred upfront payment from the hylenex partnership as revenues under collaborative agreements for the year ended december  as a result of the termination of the hylenex partnership  at december  we had recharacterized deferred revenue of approximately  as a reserve for product returns for hylenex recombinant api previously delivered to baxter that could be returned  or delivered products 
pursuant to the terms of the transition agreement  baxter no longer had the right to return the delivered products 
accordingly  we recharacterized the reserve for product returns for the delivered products of approximately  to current deferred revenue and recognized such deferred revenue as product sales revenue for the year ended december  share based payments we use the fair value method to account for share based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance on stock compensation using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

table of contents the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies

research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  research related manufacturing services  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
advance payments  including nonrefundable amounts  for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts will be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed or such time that the company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
milestone payments that we make in connection with in licensed technology or product candidates are expensed as incurred when there is uncertainty in receiving future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates 
we consider the future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain until such licensed technology or product candidates are approved for marketing by regulatory bodies such as the fda or when other significant risk factors are abated 
management has viewed future economic benefits for all of our licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain and has expensed these amounts for accounting purposes 
payments in connection with our clinical trials are often made under contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee  unit price or on a time and material basis 
payments under these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment or treatment of patients or the completion of other clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates and or representations from service providers regarding work performed  including actual level of patient enrollment  completion of patient studies and clinical trial progress 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain 
if the contracted amounts are modified for instance  as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
revisions in scope of contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain 
because of the uncertainty of possible future changes to the scope of work in clinical trials contracts  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
historically  we have had no material changes in our clinical trial expense accruals that would have had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
inventories  net inventories  net are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost  which includes amounts related to materials and costs incurred by the company s contract manufacturers  is determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventories are reviewed periodically for potential excess  dated or obsolete status 
management evaluates the carrying value of inventories on a regular basis  taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand  the price it expects to obtain for products in their respective markets compared with historical cost and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand 

table of contents raw materials inventories consist of raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s bulk drug material for hylenex recombinant product 
work in process inventories consist of in process hylenex recombinant 
finished goods inventories consist of finished hylenex recombinant product 
as a result of the termination of the hylenex partnership in january  we recorded a reserve for inventory obsolescence of approximately  and  for hylenex recombinant api for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately zero and  respectively 
we expense costs relating to the purchase and production of pre approval inventories for which the sole use is pre approval products as research and development expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is probable and future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
for products that have been approved by the fda  inventories used in clinical trials are expensed at the time the inventories are packaged for the clinical trial 
prior to receiving approval from the fda or comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries  costs related to purchases of the api and the manufacturing of the product candidate are recorded as research and development expense 
all direct manufacturing costs incurred after approval are capitalized into inventories

the company also received million in milestone payments from the partners upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
the decrease in reimbursements for research and development services was due to the decrease in services requested by the partners 
research and development services rendered by us on behalf of our partners are at the request of the partners  therefore  the amount of future revenues related to reimbursable research and development services is uncertain 
we expect the non reimbursement revenues under our collaborative agreements to continue to fluctuate in future periods based on our partners abilities to meet various clinical and regulatory milestones set forth in such agreements and our abilities to obtain new collaborative agreements 
cost of product sales cost of product sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was primarily due to a reserve for inventory obsolescence of  for hylenex recombinant api in in connection with the termination of the hylenex partnership in january based on the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december  we expect cost of product sales to increase in future periods

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
on february   we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating approximately million in proceeds after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions but before any deductions for expenses 
we will continue to have significant cash requirements to support product development activities 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the success of our clinical development programs  regulatory and market acceptance  and the resources we devote to research and other commercialization activities 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we anticipate total net cash burn of approximately to million for the year ending december   depending on the progress of various preclinical and clinical programs  the timing of our manufacturing scale up and the achievement of various milestones under our existing collaborative agreements 
we do not expect our revenues to be sufficient to fund operations for several years 
we expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources  anticipated revenues from our existing collaborations and cash that we may raise through future transactions 
we may finance future cash needs through any one of the following financing vehicles i the public offering of securities  ii new collaborative agreements  iii expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships  iv private financings  and or v other equity or debt financings 
we are currently a well known seasoned issuer and may file automatic shelf registration statements at any time with the sec 
in february  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
with the sec  which allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell equity  debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units 
we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
our existing cash and cash equivalents may not be adequate to fund our operations until we become cash flow positive  if ever 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  financing will be obtained on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we may need to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  delay the launch of our product candidates  if approved  and or restructure our operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations  the issuance of warrants that may ultimately dilute existing stockholders when exercised and covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business 

table of contents cash flows operating activities net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of net cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to the decrease in net loss of million adjusted for non cash items including stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization in addition to changes in working capital 
the decrease in net loss after adjustments for non cash items was mainly due to the receipts of million in upfront license fees from the viropharma and intrexon partnerships and milestone payments totaling million received under the collaborative partnership  offset in part by an increase in r d and sg a expenses 
net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to million of net cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to a reduction in partnerships payments of approximately million and an increase of approximately million cash payments for prepaid expenses and other assets in  partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses of approximately million and a decrease of approximately million in cash payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we typically invest all  or substantially all  of our cash in money market funds that invest primarily in government securities 
our investment policy also permits investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december  and  we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other investments that we believe to be highly liquid 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december  and  this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date nor our net loss for the years then ended 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure
