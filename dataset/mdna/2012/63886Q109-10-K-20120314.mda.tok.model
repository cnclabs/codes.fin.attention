item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our performance trends and outlook for more information 
our long term intentions to grow our revenue and profitability are based on the following business strategies expand rental fleet 
we intend to increase the size of our rental fleet by fabricating compressor units in numbers that correspond to the growth of the market and in relation to market share gains we may experience 
we believe our growth will continue to be primarily driven through our placement of small to medium horsepower wellhead natural gas compressors for non conventional natural gas production  which is the single largest and fastest growing segment of us gas production according to data from the eia 
geographic expansion 
we will continue to consolidate our operations in existing areas  as well as pursue focused expansion into new geographic regions as opportunities are identified 
we presently provide our products and services to a customer base of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in new mexico  texas  michigan  colorado  wyoming  utah  oklahoma  pennsylvania  west virginia and kansas 
expand our secondary product lines 
in addition to our primary rental and engineered product business lines  we will emphasize the growth of our other products  eg  flares  cip compressor products and general compressor maintenance and repair services 
selectively pursue acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that would provide us with access to new markets or enhance our current market position 
competitive strengths we believe our competitive strengths include superior customer service 
our emphasis on the small to medium horsepower markets has enabled us to effectively meet the evolving needs of our customers 
we believe these markets have been under serviced by our larger competitors which  coupled with our personalized services and in depth knowledge of our customers operating needs and growth plans  have allowed us to enhance our relationships with existing customers as well as attract new customers 
the size  type and geographic diversity of our rental fleet enable us to provide customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications 
we are able to select the correct equipment for the job  rather than the customer trying to fit its application to our equipment 
diversified product line 
our compressors are available as high and low pressure rotary screw and reciprocating packages 
they are designed to meet a number of applications  including wellhead production  natural gas gathering  natural gas transmission  vapor recovery and gas and plunger lift 
in addition  our compressors can be built to handle a variety of gas mixtures  including air  nitrogen  carbon dioxide  hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbon gases 
a diversified product line helps us compete by being able to satisfy widely varying pressure  volume and production conditions that customers encounter 
purpose built rental compressors 
our rental compressor packages have been designed and built to address the primary requirements of our customers in the producing regions in which we operate 
our units are compact in design and are easy  quick and inexpensive to move  install and start up 
our control systems are technically advanced and allow the operator to start and stop our units remotely and or in accordance with well conditions 
we believe our rental fleet is also one of the newest 
experienced management team 
on average  our executive and operating management team has over years of oilfield services industry experience 
we believe our management team has successfully demonstrated its ability to grow our business both organically and through selective acquisitions 
broad geographic presence 
we presently provide our products and services to a customer base of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in new mexico  texas  michigan  colorado  wyoming  utah  oklahoma  pennsylvania  west virginia and kansas 
our footprint allows us to service many of the natural gas producing regions in the united states 
we believe that operating in diverse geographic regions allows us better utilization of our compressors  minimal incremental expenses  operating synergies  volume based purchasing  leveraged inventories and cross trained personnel 
long standing customer relationships 
we have developed long standing relationships providing compression equipment to many major and independent oil and natural gas companies 
our customers generally continue to rent our compressors after the expiration of the initial terms of our rental agreements  which we believe reflects their satisfaction with the reliability and performance of our services and products 
major customers sales and rental income to eog resources  inc eog and devon energy production  inc devon in the year ended december  amounted to and of revenue  respectively 
sales and rental income to devon in the year ended december  amounted to of revenue 
sales and rental income to xto energy  inc and devon in the year ended december  each amounted to of revenue 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in  or eog  devon  and linn operating amounted to   and of our accounts receivable as of december   respectively 
bp and devon amounted to and  respectively  of our accounts receivable as of december  no other customers amounted to more than of our accounts receivable as of december  and the loss of any of the above customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  depending upon the demand for our compressors at the time of such loss and our ability to attract new customers 
sales and marketing our sales force pursues the rental and sales market for compressors and flare equipment and other services in their respective territories 
additionally  our personnel coordinate with each other to develop relationships with customers who operate in multiple regions 
our sales and marketing strategy is focused on communication with current customers and potential customers through frequent direct contact  technical assistance  print literature  direct mail and referrals 
our sales and marketing personnel coordinate with our operations personnel in order to promptly respond to and address customer needs 
our overall sales and marketing efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing the customer s cash flow through enhanced product design  fabrication  manufacturing  installation  customer service and support 
competition we have a number of competitors in the natural gas compression segment  some of which have greater financial resources 
we believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price  customer service  including the ability to place personnel in remote locations  flexibility in meeting customer needs  and quality and reliability of our compressors and related services 
compressor industry participants can achieve significant advantages through increased size and geographic breadth 
as the number of rental compressors in our rental fleet increases  the number of sales  support  and maintenance personnel required and the minimum level of inventory do not increase proportionately 
backlog as of december   we had a sales backlog of approximately million compared to million as of december  
we expect to fulfill the backlog in sales backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received  satisfactory credit or a financing arrangement exists  and delivery is scheduled 
in addition  the major components of our compressors are acquired from suppliers through periodic purchase orders that in many instances require three or four months of lead time prior to delivery of the order 
employees as of december   we had total employees 
no employees are represented by a labor union  and we believe we have good relations with our employees 
liability and other insurance coverage our equipment and services are provided to customers who are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry  such as blowouts  explosions  caterings  fires  and oil spills 
we maintain liability insurance that we believe is customary in the industry and which includes environmental cleanup  but excludes product warranty insurance because the majority of components on our compressor unit are covered by the manufacturers 
we also maintain insurance with respect to our facilities 
based on our historical experience  we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate 
however  there is a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that insurance may not cover all losses 
in addition  insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation  and changes in coverage could result in less coverage  increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions 
government regulation all of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal  state  foreign and local laws  rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business  including containment and disposal of hazardous materials  oilfield waste  other waste materials and acids 
to date  we have not been required to expend significant resources in order to satisfy applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future 
however  compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material and we could incur liabilities for noncompliance 
our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  which relate to the oil and natural gas industry 
the adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic  environmental and other policy reasons could increase our costs and could have an adverse effect on our operations 
the state and federal environmental laws and regulations that currently apply to our operations could become more stringent in the future 
we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were or are currently standard in the industry 
however  materials such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  wash down waters and sandblast material may have been disposed of or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors 
in addition  some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control either as to such entities treatment of materials or the manner in which such materials may have been disposed of or released 
the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  commonly known as cercla  and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on owners and operators of sites  and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at sites 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of hazardous wastes 
although cercla currently excludes certain materials from the definition of hazardous substances  and the rcra also excludes certain materials from regulation  such exemptions by congress under both cercla and the rcra may be deleted  limited or modified in the future 
we could become subject to requirements to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators from properties 
the federal water pollution control act and the oil pollution act of and implementing regulations govern the prevention of discharges  including oil and produced water spills  and liability for drainage into waters 
our operations are also subject to federal  state  and local regulations for the control of air emissions 
the federal clean air act and various state and local laws impose on us certain air quality requirements 
amendments to the clean air act revised the definition of major source such that emissions from both wellhead and associated equipment involved in oil and natural gas production may be added to determine if a source is a major source 
as a consequence  more facilities may become major sources and thus may require us to make increased compliance expenditures 
we believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations  and the phasing in of emission controls and other known regulatory requirements should not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or operational results 
however  it is possible that future developments  such as new or increasingly strict requirements and environmental laws and enforcement policies there under  could lead to material costs of environmental compliance by us 
while we may be able to pass on the additional cost of complying with such laws to our customers  there can be no assurance that attempts to do so will be successful 
some risk of environmental liability and other costs are inherent in the nature of our business  however  and there can be no assurance that environmental costs will not rise 
in recent years  increased concern has been raised over the protection of the environment 
legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced in congress  and there has been a wide ranging policy debate  both nationally and internationally  regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation 
in addition  efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues  such as the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen in also  the epa has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects 
recently  the epa declared that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health and proposed to expand its regulations relating to those emissions 
to the extent that new laws or other governmental actions restrict the energy industry or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry  we could be adversely affected 
we cannot determine to what extent our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations 
patents  trademarks and other intellectual property we believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence  creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent  trademark  or copyright 
nevertheless  as part of our ongoing research  development and manufacturing activities  we may seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements 
we owned one united states patent covering certain flare system technologies  however  it expired in january we do not own any foreign patents 
although we continue to use the patented technology and consider it useful in certain applications  we do not consider the expired patent to be material to our business as a whole 
suppliers and raw materials fabrication of our rental compressors involves the purchase by us of engines  compressors  coolers and other components  and the assembly of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations 
these major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third party suppliers on an as needed basis  which typically requires a three to four month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules 
although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier  we believe we have adequate alternative sources available 
in the past  we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors 
however  the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition  particularly if we are unable to increase our rental rates and sale prices proportionate to any such component price increases

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks associated with owning our common stock 
although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material  they are not the only risks relating to our industry  our business and our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those that we have not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks associated with our industry adverse macroeconomic and business conditions may significantly and negatively affect our results of operations 
continued weak economic conditions in the united states and abroad have  and will likely continue to  substantially affect our revenue and profitability 
the domestic and global financial crisis  continued fluctuating natural gas prices  and the unprecedented levels of disruption and continuing illiquidity in the credit markets have had an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  and if sustained or worsened  such adverse effects could continue or worsen 
uncertainty and turmoil in the credit markets may negatively impact the ability of our customers to finance purchases of our products and services and could result in a decrease in  or cancellation of  orders included in our backlog or adversely affect the collectability of our receivables 
if the availability of credit to our customers is reduced  they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures  thereby decreasing demand for our products and services  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
decreased oil and natural gas prices and oil and gas industry expenditure levels could adversely affect our revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry  which  in turn  are based on budgets to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas 
when these expenditures decline  our revenue will suffer 
the industry s willingness to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas depends largely upon the prevailing view of future oil and natural gas prices 
prices for oil and natural gas historically have been  and are likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
many factors affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas and  therefore  influence oil and natural gas prices  including the level of oil and natural gas production  the level of oil and natural gas inventories  domestic and worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the expected cost of developing new reserves  the cost of producing oil and natural gas  the level of drilling and completions activity  inclement weather  domestic and worldwide economic activity  regulatory and other federal and state requirements in the united states  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other large producers to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil  political conditions in or affecting oil and natural gas producing countries  terrorist activities in the united states and elsewhere  the cost of developing alternate energy sources  environmental regulation  and tax policies 
depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas  companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail their drilling programs  thereby reducing demand for our equipment and services 
our rental contracts are generally short term  and oil and natural gas companies tend to respond quickly to upward or downward changes in prices 
any reduction in drilling and production activities may materially erode both pricing and utilization rates for our equipment and services and adversely affects our financial results 
as a result  we may suffer losses  be unable to make necessary capital expenditures and be unable to meet our financial obligations 
the intense competition in our industry could result in reduced profitability and loss of market share for us 
in our business segments  we compete with the oil and natural gas industry s largest equipment and service providers who have greater name recognition than we do 
these companies also have substantially greater financial resources  larger operations and greater budgets for marketing  research and development than we do 
they may be better able to compete because of their broader geographic dispersion and ability to take advantage of international opportunities  the greater number of compressors in their fleet or their product and service diversity 
as a result  we could lose customers and market share to those competitors 
these companies may also be better positioned than us to successfully endure downturns in the oil and natural gas industry 
our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better prices  features  performance or other competitive characteristics than our products and services 
competitive pressures or other factors also may result in significant price competition that could harm our revenue and our business 
additionally  we may face competition in our efforts to acquire other businesses 
our industry is highly cyclical  and our results of operations may be volatile 
our industry is highly cyclical  with periods of high demand and high pricing followed by periods of low demand and low pricing 
periods of low demand intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rental equipment being idle for long periods of time 
we may be required to enter into lower rate rental contracts in response to market conditions  and our sales may decrease as a result of such conditions 
due to the short term nature of most of our rental contracts  changes in market conditions can quickly affect our business 
as a result of the cyclicality of our industry  our results of operations may be volatile in the future 
increased regulation or ban of current fracturing techniques could reduce demand for our compressors fracturing frac is a process that results in the creation of fractures in geological formations in order to stimulate production from oil and gas wells 
fracturing is also done to increase the rate and ultimate recovery of oil and natural gas 
hydraulic frac is the technique that has allowed domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production companies to produce massive shale deposits often referred to as unconventional plays 
concerns have been raised over possible environmental damages related to fluids used in the frac process 
in june  the frac fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act was introduced in congress via companion bills in the house and senate 
the frac act seeks to amend the safe drinking water act so that hydraulic fracturing would be regulated on a federal level 
a ban of hydraulic fracing would likely halt some projects  including unconventional projects  at least temporarily 
expanded regulations are likely to introduce a period of uncertainty as companies determine ways to proceed 
any curtailment could result in a reduction of demand for our compressors  potentially effecting both sales and rentals of our units 
we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that could require us to take costly compliance actions that could harm our financial condition 
our fabrication and maintenance operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
in these operations  we generate and manage hazardous wastes such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  wash down wastes  and sandblast material 
we attempt to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices and  with respect to acquisitions  will attempt to identify and assess whether there is any environmental risk before completing an acquisition 
based on the nature of the industry  however  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
the waste on these properties may be subject to federal or state environmental laws that could require us to remove the wastes or remediate sites where they have been released 
we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs  natural resource and other damages as a result of our conduct or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners  lessees or other third parties 
environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past  and they are likely to change in the future 
if current existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could harm our operations and financial condition  including the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations  reduction or cessation in operations  and performance of site investigatory  remedial or other corrective actions 
risks associated with our company as of december   a significant majority of our compressor rentals were for terms of six months or less which  if terminated or not renewed  would adversely impact our revenue and our ability to recover our initial equipment costs 
the length of our compressor rental agreements with our customers varies based on customer needs  equipment configurations and geographic area 
in most cases  under currently prevailing rental rates  the initial rental periods are not long enough to enable us to fully recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating the equipment 
we cannot be sure that a substantial number of our customers will continue to renew their rental agreements or that we will be able to re rent the equipment to new customers or that any renewals or re rentals will be at comparable rental rates 
the inability to timely renew or re rent a substantial portion of our compressor rental fleet would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we could be subject to substantial liability claims that could harm our financial condition 
our products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications where an accident or a failure of a product can cause personal injury  loss of life  damage to property  equipment or the environment  or suspension of operations 
while we maintain insurance coverage  we face the following risks under our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  such as damages from significant product liabilities and from environmental contamination  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits  and we do not maintain coverage against the risk of interruption of our business 
any claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase 
any future damages caused by our products or services that are not covered by insurance  are in excess of policy limits or are subject to substantial deductibles  would reduce our earnings and our cash available for operations 
we might be unable to employ qualified technical personnel  which could hamper our present operations or increase our costs 
many of the compressors that we sell or rent are mechanically complex and often must perform in harsh conditions 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain a sufficient number of technical personnel who have the ability to design  utilize  enhance and maintain these compressors 
our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
the demand for skilled workers is high  and supply is limited 
a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force or cause an increase in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
if either of these events were to occur  our cost structure could increase and our operations and growth potential could be impaired 
we will require a substantial amount of capital to expand our compressor rental fleet and grow our business 
during  the amount we will spend on capital expenditures related to rental compression equipment will be determined primarily by the activity of our customers  and we do not anticipate that demand exceeding what we can fund with internally generated funds and additional bank borrowing with our current bank line 
the amount and timing of any of these capital expenditures may vary depending on a variety of factors  including the level of activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and the presence of alternative uses for our capital  including any acquisitions that we may pursue 
historically  we have funded our capital expenditures through internally generated funds  borrowings under bank credit facilities and the proceeds of equity financings 
although we believe that cash flows from our operations will provide us with sufficient cash to fund our planned capital expenditures for  we cannot assure you that these sources will be sufficient 
we may require additional capital to fund any unanticipated capital expenditures  including any acquisitions  and to fund our growth beyond  and necessary capital may not be available to us when we need it or on acceptable terms 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on the results of our operations and the status of various capital and industry markets at the time we seek such capital 
failure to generate sufficient cash flow  together with the absence of alternative sources of capital  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
disruptions in the credit and financial markets have adversely affected financial institutions  inhibited lending and limited access to capital and credit for many companies 
several large financial institutions have either recently failed or been dependent on the assistance of the us federal government to continue to operate as a going concern 
of our million line of credit  we owe million as of december  all outstanding principal and unpaid interest is due on december  although we believe that we will be able to renew our existing line of credit  or obtain a new line of credit with another lender  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in renewing our line of credit or obtaining a new line 
in addition  any renewal of our existing line of credit or creation of a new line of credit may be on terms less favorable that our existing line 
for instance  changes in the terms of a new line of credit may include  but not be limited to a reduction in the borrowing amount  an increase in interest rate to be paid on borrowings under the line  or restrictive covenants that are more onerous than those on our existing line of credit 
we believe that the lender participating in our current credit agreement has adequate capital and resources  however  we can provide no assurance that this lender will continue to operate as a going concern in the future 
if our current lender were to fail  it is possible that the borrowing capacity under our credit agreement would be reduced or eliminated 
in the event that the availability under our credit agreement was reduced significantly  we could be required to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs 
our options for addressing such capital constraints would include  but not be limited to obtaining commitments from other banks to fund increased amounts under the terms of our credit agreement  accessing the public capital markets  or delaying certain projects 
if it became necessary to access additional capital  any alternatives at the time may be on terms less favorable than under our existing credit agreement terms  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if future financing is not available to us when required  as a result of limited access to the credit markets or otherwise  or is not available to us on acceptable terms  we may be unable take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our current debt level may negatively impact our current and future financial stability 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  and accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
as a result of our indebtedness  we might not have the ability to incur any substantial additional indebtedness 
the level of our indebtedness could have several important effects on our future operations  including our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and other purposes may be limited  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and our leverage could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns 
we believe that our current cash position and the amount available under the current revolver are sufficient to meet our capital needs through if we are unable to service our debt  we will likely be forced to take remedial steps that are contrary to our business plan 
as of december   we had million due under our line of credit agreement which allows us to borrow up to million provided we maintain certain collateral and borrowing base requirements 
it is possible that our business will not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt service requirements and the payment of principal when due depending on the amount of borrowings on the agreement at any given time 
if this were to occur  we may be forced to sell assets at disadvantageous prices  obtain additional financing  or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on terms that may be less favorable to us 
our current credit agreement contains covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility and  if breached  could expose us to severe remedial provisions 
under the terms of our loan agreement  we must comply with a minimum leverage ratio  comply with a commitment coverage ratio  not exceed specified levels of debt  and comply with limits on asset sales 
our ability to meet the financial ratios and tests under our credit agreement can be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to satisfy those ratios and tests 
a breach of any one of these covenants could permit the bank to accelerate the debt so that it is immediately due and payable 
if a breach occurred  no further borrowings would be available under our credit agreement 
if we were unable to repay the debt  the bank could proceed against and foreclose on our assets  substantially all of which have been pledged as collateral to secure payment of our indebtedness 
if we fail to acquire or successfully integrate additional businesses  our growth may be limited and our results of operations may suffer 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses or assets 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such acquisitions 
successful acquisition of businesses or assets will depend on various factors  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain financing and the competitive environment for acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses or assets that we acquire in the future 
the integration of acquired businesses is likely to be complex and time consuming and place a significant strain on management and may disrupt our business 
we also may be adversely impacted by any unknown liabilities of acquired businesses  including environmental liabilities 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating common accounting  information and communication systems  operating procedures  internal controls and human resources practices  including incompatibility of business cultures and the loss of key employees and customers 
these difficulties may reduce our ability to gain customers or retain existing customers  and may increase operating expenses  resulting in reduced revenues and income and a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
the loss of one or more of our current customers could adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is dependent not only on securing new customers but also on maintaining current customers 
we had two customers that accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   and one customer that accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  unless we are able to retain our existing customers  or secure new customers if we lose one or more of our significant customers  our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected 
loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of our executive and senior management team 
if any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we do not carry any key man insurance on any of our officers or directors 
failure to effectively manage our growth and expansion could adversely affect our business and operating results and our internal controls 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations in recent years and anticipate that our growth will continue if we are able to execute our strategy 
our rapid growth has placed significant strain on our management and other resources which  given our expected future growth rate  is likely to continue 
to manage our future growth  we must be able to  among other things accurately assess the number of additional officers and employees we will require and the areas in which they will be required  attract  hire and retain additional highly skilled and motivated officers and employees  train and manage our work force in a timely and effective manner  upgrade and expand our office infrastructure so that it is appropriate for our level of activity  and improve our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
liability to customers under warranties and indemnification provisions may materially and adversely affect our earnings 
we provide warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the equipment we manufacture 
our equipment is complex and often deployed in harsh environments 
failure of this equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services  replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to a customer 
we have in the past received warranty claims and we expect to continue to receive them in the future 
to the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period  our reputation  our ability to obtain future business and our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
our rental and sales contracts provide for varying of indemnification from our customers and in most cases may require us to indemnify our customers 
under some of our rental and sales contracts  liability with respect to personnel and property is customarily assigned on a knock for knock basis  which means that we and our customers assume liability for our respective personnel and property 
however  in certain rental and sales contracts we assume liability for damage to our customer s property and other third party on the site resulting from our negligence 
since our products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications in the natural energy industry  expenses and liabilities in connection with accidents involving our products and services could be extensive and may exceed our insurance coverages 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to maintain effective internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and to help prevent financial fraud 
if  as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls  we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business decision process may be adversely affected  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the price of our stock could decrease as a result 
we must evaluate our intangible assets annually for impairment 
our intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and consist of goodwill and patent costs and other identifiable intangibles 
we did not identify any impairment of our intangibles for the year ended december  future impairment tests could result in impairments of our intangibles 
we expect to continue to amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over the same time periods as previously used  and we will test our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least once each year 
in addition  we are required to assess the consumptive life  or longevity  of our intangible assets with finite lives and adjust their amortization periods accordingly 
our net goodwill and intangible assets were recorded on our balance sheet at approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our identifiable intangibles are currently amortized at a rate of  per year 
any impairment in future periods of those assets  or a reduction in their consumptive lives  could materially and adversely affect our statements of income and financial position 
a reduction in demand primarily for natural gas or prices for this commodity and credit markets could adversely affect our business 
our results of operations depend upon the level of activity in the energy market  including natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
oil and natural gas prices and the level of drilling and exploration activity can be volatile 
for example  oil and natural gas exploration and development activity and the number of well completions typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
as a result  the demand for our natural gas compression services could be adversely affected 
a reduction in demand could also force us to reduce our pricing substantially 
additionally  our customers production from unconventional natural gas sources such as tight sands  shale and coal beds constitute the majority percentage of our business 
such unconventional sources are generally less economically feasible to produce in lower natural gas price environments 
these factors could in turn negatively impact the demand for our products and services 
a decline in demand for oil and natural gas or prices for those commodities and credit markets generally have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations 
the erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business 
many of our customers finance their exploration and development activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
during times when the oil or natural gas markets weaken  our customers are more likely to experience a downturn in their financial condition 
many of our customers equity values substantially declined during the recent recession  and the capital markets have not fully recovered making it an unreliable source of financing for some customers 
the combination of a reduction in cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing will result in a reduction in our customers spending for our products and services in for example  our customers could seek to preserve capital by canceling month to month contracts  canceling or delaying scheduled maintenance of their existing natural gas compression equipment or determining not to enter into any new natural gas compression service contracts or purchase new compression equipment 
risks associated with our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate which may cause our common stock to trade at a substantially lower price than the price paid for our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell securities in the future is subject to substantial fluctuations in response to various factors  including our ability to successfully accomplish our business strategy  the trading volume of our stock  changes in governmental regulations  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual financial results  our involvement in litigation  general market conditions  the prices of oil and natural gas  announcements by us and our competitors  our liquidity  our ability to raise additional funds  and other events 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
substantial sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  may lower our stock price or make it difficult for us to raise additional equity capital in the future 
of the outstanding shares of our common stock are owned by four institutional investors  each of which owns more than of our outstanding shares as of march  potential sales of large amounts of these shares in a short period of time by one or more of these significant investors could have a negative impact on our stock price 
in addition  potential sales of our common stock by our directors and officers  who beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march   could also have a negative impact on our stock price 
we currently have on file with the sec an effective universal shelf registration statement on form s  which enables us to sell  from time to time  our common stock and other securities covered by the registration statement in one or more public offerings 
the shelf registration statement allows us to enter the public markets and consummate sales of the registered securities in rapid fashion and with little or no notice 
issuances of securities under our shelf registration statement may dilute our existing shareholders 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if we issue debt or equity securities  you may lose certain rights and be diluted 
if we raise funds in the future through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the securities issued may have rights and preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations or dilute your ownership in our company 
if securities analysts downgrade our stock or cease coverage of us  the price of our stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not control these analysts 
furthermore  there are many large  well established  publicly traded companies active in our industry and market  which may mean that it is less likely that we will receive widespread analyst coverage 
if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
we do not intend to pay  and have restrictions upon our ability to pay  dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
net income from our operations  if any  will be used for the development of our business  including capital expenditures  and to retire debt 
in addition  our credit agreement contains restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
we have a comparatively low number of shares of common stock outstanding and  therefore  our common stock may suffer from limited liquidity and its prices will likely be volatile and its value may be adversely affected 
because of our relatively low number of outstanding shares of common stock  the trading price of our common stock will likely be subject to significant price fluctuations and limited liquidity 
this may adversely affect the value of your investment 
in addition  our common stock price could be subject to fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  changes in management  future announcements concerning us  general trends in the industry and other events or factors as well as those described above 
provisions contained in our governing documents could hinder a change in control of us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that directors are elected for three year terms  with approximately one third of the board of directors standing for election each year  cumulative voting is not allowed  which limits the ability of minority shareholders to elect any directors  the unanimous vote of the board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all shares entitled to vote in the election of directors is required to change the size of the board of directors  and directors may be removed only for cause and only by the holders of not less than of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock 
the board of directors can fix the terms of the preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
in addition  preferred stock could be used in connection with the board of directors adoption of a shareholders rights plan also known as a poison pill  which would make it much more difficult to effect a change in control of our company through acquiring or controlling blocks of stock 
also  our directors and officers as a group will continue to beneficially own stock and although this is not a majority of our stock  it confers substantial voting power in the election of directors and management of our company 
this would make it difficult for other minority stockholders to effect a change in control or otherwise extend any significant control over our management 
this may adversely affect the market price and interfere with the voting and other rights of our common stock

ebitda is defined  reconciled to net income and discussed immediately below under non gaap financial measures 
non gaap financial measures our definition and use of ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of earnings net income from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
this term  as used and defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  management believes ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of ebitda  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  it helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating structure  and it is used by our management for various purposes  including as a measure of operating performance  in presentations to our board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
there are other material limitations to using ebitda as a measure of performance  including the inability to analyze the impact of certain recurring items that materially affect our net income or loss  and the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies 
please read the table below under reconciliation to see how ebitda reconciles to our net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
definition and use of gross margin we define gross margin as total revenue less cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense 
gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by our management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which are key components of our operations 
gross margin differs from gross profit  in that gross profit includes depreciation expense 
we believe gross margin is important because it focuses on the current operating performance of our operations and excludes the impact of the prior historical costs of the assets acquired or constructed that are utilized in those operations  the indirect costs associated with our selling  general and administrative activities  the impact of our financing methods and income taxes 
depreciation expense may not accurately reflect the costs required to maintain and replenish the operational usage of our assets and therefore may not portray the costs from current operating activity 
rather  depreciation expense reflects the systematic allocation of historical property and equipment values over the estimated useful lives 
gross margin has certain material limitations associated with its use as compared to net income 
these limitations are primarily due to the exclusion of certain expenses 
each of these excluded expenses is material to our results of operations 
because we use capital assets  depreciation expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue and selling  general and administrative expense is a necessary cost to support our operations and required corporate activities 
in order to compensate for these limitations  management uses this non gaap measure as a supplemental measure to other gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of our performance 
as an indicator of our operating performance  gross margin should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
our gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate gross margin in the same manner

the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see special note regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview we fabricate  manufacture  rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment 
our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors 
our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to months 
after the initial term of our rental contracts  most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month to month basis 
rental amounts are paid monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors 
as of december  we had  natural gas compressors totaling approximately  horsepower rented to customers  compared to  natural gas compressors totaling approximately  horsepower rented to customers at december  of the  compressors rented at december    were rented on a month to month basis 
we also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers  designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures  production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought 
fabrication of compressors involves the purchase by us of engines  compressors  coolers and other components  and then assembling these components on skids for delivery to customer locations 
these major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third party suppliers on an as needed basis  which presently requires a three to four month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules 
although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier  we believe we have adequate alternative sources available 
in the past  we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors 
however  the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition  particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases 
we also manufacture a proprietary line of compressor frames  cylinders and parts  known as our cip cylinder in plane product line 
we use finished cip component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators 
we also design  fabricate  sell  install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide  carbon dioxide  natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases 
to provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses  we stock varying levels of replacement parts at our midland  texas facility and at field service locations 
we also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business 
we provide service and maintenance to our customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as required basis in the absence of a service contract 
maintenance agreements typically have terms of six months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee 
the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our three business segments for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands sales rental service and maintenance total our strategy for growth is focused on our compressor rental business 
margins for our rental business historically run in the high to low range  while margins for the compressor sales business tend to be in the mid range 
if our rental business grows and contributes a larger percentage of our total revenues  we expect our overall company wide margins to improve over time 
the oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature 
the most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for natural gas and the corresponding changes in commodity prices 
as demand and prices increase  oil and natural gas producers increase their capital expenditures for drilling  development and production activities 
generally  the increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for service and equipment companies 
in general  we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the natural gas industry  with changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices more significantly affecting our business than changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices 
we also believe that demand for compression services and products is driven by declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields and  more recently  by increased focus by producers on non conventional natural gas production  such as coal bed methane  gas shale and tight gas  which typically requires more compression than production from conventional natural gas reservoirs 
demand for our products and services was strong throughout most of  but in the demand declined due to lower natural gas prices  decreased demand for natural gas and the economic recession 
during the latter part of the economy began to recover and demand for our products began to strengthen 
this recovery continued into  but natural gas prices remained stagnant 
for fiscal year  our forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers compression requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows 
any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and or addition or replacement of service vehicles 
we believe that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements through we may require additional capital to fund any unanticipated expenditures  including any acquisitions of other businesses  although that capital may not be available to us when we need it or on acceptable terms 
notwithstanding the continued weak economy  we believe the long term trend in our market is favorable 
critical accounting policies and practices we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and valuation of inventory 
revenue recognition revenue from the sales of custom and fabricated compressors and flare systems is recognized when title passes to the customer  the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery occurs as directed by our customer 
revenue from sale of rental units is included in sales revenue when equipment is shipped or title is transferred to the customer 
exchange and rebuild compressor revenue is recognized when both the replacement compressor has been delivered and the rebuild assessment has been completed 
revenue from compressor services is recognized upon providing services to the customer 
maintenance agreement revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
rental revenue is recognized over the terms of the respective rental agreements 
deferred income represents payments received before a product is shipped 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
at december   three customers accounted for approximately   and of our accounts receivable  and at december   two customers accounted for approximately and of our accounts receivable 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was  and  at december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our federal income taxes as well as income taxes in each of the states in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in the market value of our stock 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we completed a review of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of our analysis considered multiple valuation models  including an estimate of future discounted cash flows  the market capitalization of the company and trading multiples 
comparing the book value including goodwill to the valuation methods results in an over excess market value over book value 
based on the analysis we concluded that no impairment of goodwill was required at december  future impairment tests could result in impairments of our intangible assets or goodwill 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
at december   an adjustment was made to remove obsolete inventory which represents of inventory 
our performance trends and outlook given the current economic environment in north america and anticipated impact of continued low natural gas prices and potentially cautious capital spending by customers  we expect the overall activity levels in to only modestly outpace currently  we believe that the strengthening commodity prices will be slow to develop for natural gas 
in addition  the recovery of credit and capital market conditions resulting from the recent financial crisis will continue to impact the level of capital spending by our customers in the near term 
we believe that the recovery from the recent recession will be slow 
the result will likely be lagging capital spending by our customers and therefore slow growth in demand for our products and services 
we anticipate industry capital spending will be flat to a moderate increase in compared levels  and we believe our fabrication business will likely remain at a similar production level though we believe our rental operations business will increase assuming the nation recovers from the recession in and  although we can give no assurances that this will occur 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our revenues  percentage of total revenues  gross margin  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  and gross margin percentage of each of our segments for the years ended december  and december  gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation

total revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this was mainly the result of a increase in sales revenue  a increase in rental revenue and a increase in service and maintenance revenue 
sales revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this increase is the result of greater demand for our products which resulted in more compressor units being sold to customers primarily from our tulsa operations 
the increase in demand is due to our customers continued investment in non conventional shale plays which requires compression for produced natural gas 
the price of natural gas on december  was mmbtu  down from mmbtu one year ago 
because of the significant decline in natural gas prices  along with economic uncertainty and tightened credit  the energy industry continues to encounter reduced capital spending  particularly for goods and services with respect to natural gas activities 
in addition  capital project funding was shifted from gas projects to oil projects as the price of oil was not as volatile as gas  and oil prices have rebounded from its lows compared to natural gas prices 
since our compressors are primarily used in the production of natural gas  our compressor sales have been significantly impacted due to the factors described above 
our strategy over time has been to accelerate our rental revenues so that they are a larger component of our top line  but we intend to maintain our ability to build and sell custom fabricated equipment 
in support of this  we have continued to cultivate new sales oriented customers and are entertaining requests for bids on larger reciprocating compressors instead of being solely focused on screw type equipment 
sales included compressor unit sales  flare sales  parts sales and compressor rebuilds 
rental revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this increase was the result of improved rental pricing of our units and the achievement of higher fleet utilization 
as of december   we had  natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling approximately  horsepower  as compared to  natural gas compressors totaling approximately  horsepower at december  as of december   we had  natural gas compressors totaling approximately  horsepower rented to customers  compared to  natural gas compressors totaling approximately  horsepower rented to customers at december  the rental fleet had a utilization of as of december  the overall gross margin percentage decreased to for the twelve months ended december   from for the same period ended december  this decrease is the result of rental margins  which represent the largest percent of our revenue at  experiencing a reduction from to for the year end december  compared to the same period in the reduction in rental margin was largely driven by increased costs to maintain and service units under contract 
both sales and third party service and maintenance margins improved for the period ending december  compared to one year earlier 
the sales margin increased from to 
the sales margin in was impacted by the cost of customized orders 
third party service and maintenance margins increased from to for the period ended december  compared to the same period a year ago 
service and maintenance represents less than of our revenue providing minimal impact on our overall gross margin 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased slightly to million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period ended december  there was no significant increase item of sg a 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million  to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this increase was the result of new gas compressor rental units being added to the rental fleet from december  to december   thus increasing the depreciable base 
other income and expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period ended december  this is primarily due to a gain from the sale of our former headquarters during the first quarter of interest expense decreased from million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december   mainly due to the pay down of our term bank loan agreement 
provision for income tax increased from million to million  or  and is the result of the increase in taxable income

total revenue decreased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this was mainly the result of a decrease in sales revenue  a decrease in service and maintenance and a decrease in rental revenue 
sales revenue decreased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this decrease was the result of lower demand for our products which resulted in fewer compressor units sold to third parties primarily from our tulsa operations 
the downturn in demand was due to the overall slowdown in the economy and specific energy industry factors  especially with respect to prices for natural gas henry hub spot prices  which were very volatile and declined from a high of mmbtu in july to a low of mmbtu in august the price of natural gas on december  was mmbtu  but declined after that time 
because of the significant decline in natural gas prices  along with economic uncertainty and tightened credit  the energy industry encountered reduced capital spending  particularly for goods and services with respect to natural gas activities 
in addition  capital project funding was shifted from gas projects to oil projects as the price of oil was not as volatile as gas  and oil prices rebounded from its lows compared to natural gas prices 
since our compressors are primarily used in the production of natural gas  our compressor sales were significantly impacted due to the factors described above

in connection with establishing the credit agreement  we paid  to wnb which represented payment in full of the principal and interest owed under our term loan with wnb 
in making this payment  we drew  on the line of credit under the credit agreement 
on december   we amended and renewed the credit agreement  which was set to expire on december  the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement increased our aggregate commitment amount from million to million  subject to collateral availability 
we also have a right to request from the lender  on an uncommitted basis  an increase of up to million on the aggregate commitment which could potentially increase the commitment amount to million 
the maturity date was extended to december   and the interest rate terms were amended 
borrowing base 
at any time before the maturity of the amended credit agreement  we may draw  repay and re borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above

shelf registration statement we have an effective million universal shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission  which we filed in this shelf registration statement enables us to sell  from time to time  the securities covered by the registration statement in one or more public offerings 
the securities covered by the registration statement include common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  debt securities  rights to purchase common stock  units consisting of two or more of any of the registered securities and warrants to purchase any of the registered securities 
we may offer any of these securities independently or together in any combination with other securities 
the shelf registration statement allows us to enter the public markets and consummate sales of the registered securities in rapid fashion and with little or no notice 
we have no immediate plans to issue securities under the shelf registration statement  but our management believes that it may facilitate access to additional liquidity in the future 
however  there is no assurance that equity or debt capital would be available to us in the public markets should we determine to issue securities under the shelf registration statement 
components of our principal capital expenditures the table below shows the components of our principal capital expenditures for the three years ended december  expenditure category in thousands rental equipment  vehicles and shop equipment the level of our expenditures will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  we believe that our operating cash flow and additional bank borrowings may be required to fully fund our net capital expenditures requirements for we also believe we have significant flexibility with respect to our financing alternatives and adjustment of our expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
when considered in relation to our total financial capacity  we do not have any material continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to our current operations 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease agreements and purchase agreements 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
we entered into a purchase agreement with a vendor on july  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase up to million of our paint and coating requirements exclusively from the vendor 
in connection with the execution of the agreement  the vendor paid us a  fee which is considered to be a discount toward future purchases from the vendor 
as of december  we had met  of this obligation 
the  payment we received is recorded as a long term liability and will decrease as the purchase commitment is fulfilled 
the long term liability remaining as of december  was  recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
currently  companies have three alternatives for presenting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income and its components may be reported below the total of net income in a single statement that reports the results of operations  in a separate statement of comprehensive income that begins with net income  or within the statement of changes in equity 
among the changes  asu eliminates the option for entities to disclose comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and as such  requires entities to report comprehensive income and its components either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the case in which a single continuous financial statement is utilized  no longer will the statement be titled statement of income and comprehensive income and instead the statement will solely be titled statement of comprehensive income 
we do not expect the adoption of asu to have an impact on the presentation of our financial statements 
in september  fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  for year ended december  we have continued to assess goodwill consistent with previous years 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to protection of human safety and health and the environment  affect our operations and costs 
compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs or result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations 
in addition  we have acquired certain properties and plant facilities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
under environmental laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners 
in addition  we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for properties and plant facilities we lease  but do not own 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total expenditure budget in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
we also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which we send equipment and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk our commodity risk exposure is the pricing applicable primarily to natural gas production and to lesser extent oil production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas  companies exploring for such resources may cancel or curtail their drilling programs  thereby reducing demand for our equipment and services 
financial instruments and debt maturities our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and line of credit 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the instruments 
the fair value of our bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to us 
customer credit risk we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by our customers 
our ability to collect on rentals and sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of our customers 
unless we are able to retain our existing customers  or secure new customers if we lose one or more of our significant customers  our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected
