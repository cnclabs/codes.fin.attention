company overview we are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products and also operate service stations and convenience stores 
we own and operate two refineries with a total crude oil throughput capacity of approximately  barrels per day  or bpd 
in addition to our  bpd refinery in el paso  texas  we own and operate a refinery near gallup  new mexico  with a throughput capacity of approximately  bpd 
until september  we operated a  bpd refinery on the east coast of the united states near yorktown  virginia  and until november  we also operated a  bpd refinery near bloomfield  new mexico 
we temporarily suspended refining operations at our yorktown facility in september and finalized the sale of our yorktown refining and terminal assets in december we indefinitely suspended refining operations at the bloomfield refinery in november we continue to operate bloomfield as a product distribution terminal to supply refined products to the area 
our primary operating areas encompass west texas  arizona  new mexico  colorado  virginia  and maryland 
in addition to the refineries  we also own and operate stand alone refined product distribution terminals in albuquerque and bloomfield  new mexico  as well as asphalt terminals in phoenix and tucson  arizona  albuquerque  and el paso 
between september and december   we operated a stand alone refined product distribution terminal at yorktown 
as of december   we also operated retail service stations and convenience stores in arizona  colorado  new mexico  and texas  a fleet of crude oil and refined product truck transports  and a petroleum products wholesaler that operates in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  new mexico  texas  maryland  and virginia 

table of contents on may   we completed the acquisition of giant 
prior to the acquisition of giant  we generated substantially all of our revenues from our refining operations in el paso 
with the acquisition of giant  we also gained a diverse mix of complementary retail and wholesale businesses 
following the acquisition of giant  we began reporting our operating results in three business segments the refining group  the wholesale group  and the retail group 
our refining group currently operates the two refineries and related refined product distribution terminals and asphalt terminals 
at the refineries  we refine crude oil and other feedstocks into refined products such as gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel  and asphalt 
our refineries market refined products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our wholesale group distributes gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant products 
our retail group operates service stations and convenience stores and sells gasoline  diesel fuel  and merchandise 
see note  segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for detailed information on our operating results by segment 
major influences on results of operations refining 
our net sales fluctuate significantly with movements in refined product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks  all of which are commodities 
the spread between crude oil and refined product prices is the primary factor affecting our earnings and cash flows from operations 
the cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined products that we ultimately sell depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the supply of  and demand for  crude oil  gasoline  and other refined products 
supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  availability of imports  marketing of competitive fuels  price differentials between heavy and sour crude oils and light sweet crude oils  known as the heavy light crude oil differential  and government regulation 
refining margins experienced extreme volatility throughout and were somewhat less volatile in and gasoline margin averages have improved each year since and average diesel margins for showed improvement over and levels 
another factor impacting our recent annual margins is the year to year narrowing of heavy light crude oil differentials beginning in the second quarter of when we owned and operated our yorktown refinery  it was capable of processing up to of its throughput capacity with heavy crude oil 
heavy light differentials narrowed significantly through and remained historically narrow during the impact of this trend was particularly negative on the east coast  where refiners are traditionally dependent on the economic benefit of processing a heavier crude slate 
in addition  we had changes in our lcm reserve of million related to our yorktown inventories that decreased our cost of products sold for the year ended december  there were no such lcm reserve changes in the years ended december  or over the past three years  refining results of operations have been impacted by various impairment charges and a loss on disposal of certain refining assets 
additional discussion of these charges and losses follows below under goodwill impairment loss and long lived asset impairment losses 
other factors that impact our overall refinery gross margins include the sale of lower value products such as residuum and propane when crude costs are higher 
our refinery gross margin is further reduced because our refinery product yield is less than our total refinery throughput volume 
also affecting refining margins within refinery cost of products sold is the impact of our economic hedging activity entered into primarily to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production and to protect the value of certain crude oil  refined product  and blendstock inventories 
our refining cost of products sold includes million in net realized and unrealized economic hedging gains  and million and million in net realized and unrealized economic hedging losses for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by our refineries direct operating expenses  especially the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
the effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by increased demand during the winter months for diesel fuel in the southwest 
refining margins remain volatile and our results of operations may not reflect these historical seasonal trends 
safety  reliability  and the environmental performance of our refineries operations are critical to our financial performance 
unplanned downtime of our refineries  such as the unplanned weather and equipment related outages experienced at our el paso refinery during february and december  respectively  generally results in lost refinery gross margin opportunity  increased maintenance costs  and a temporary increase in working capital investment and inventory 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime  such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project  through a planning process that considers product availability  the margin environment  and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance 

table of contents periodically we have planned maintenance turnarounds at our refineries  which are expensed as incurred 
we shut down the south crude unit for days at the el paso refinery in the second quarter of and we performed a crude unit inspection outage for days at the yorktown refinery in october we completed a scheduled maintenance turnaround at the south side of the el paso refinery during the first quarter of our next scheduled maintenance turnarounds are during the fourth quarter of for gallup and the first quarter of for el paso 
the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
because crude oil and refined products are commodities  we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories 
our inventory of crude oil and the majority of our refined products are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation methodology 
if the market values of our inventories decline below our cost basis  we would record a write down of our inventories resulting in a non cash charge to our cost of products sold 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
based on market conditions  we recorded non cash recoveries of million related to lcm lifo inventory write downs 
in addition  due to the volatility in the price of crude oil and other blendstocks  we experienced fluctuations in our lifo reserves between and we also experienced lifo liquidations based on decreased levels in our inventories 
these lifo liquidations resulted in decreases in cost of products sold of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see note  inventories  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the impact of lifo inventory accounting 
wholesale 
our earnings and cash flows from our wholesale business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricants sold 
margins for gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant sales are equal to the sales price less total cost of sales 
cost of sales connected to our mid atlantic region wholesale business includes the results of our economic hedging activities for refined product purchases in the region 
margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
wholesale results of operations were impacted by an impairment charge related to goodwill during additional discussion of this charge follows below under goodwill impairment loss 
retail 
our earnings and cash flows from our retail business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel sold at our service stations  and by the sales and margins of merchandise sold at our convenience stores 
margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes  and are measured on a cents per gallon  or cpg  basis 
fuel margins are impacted by local supply  demand  and competition 
margins for retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the merchandise  net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage  and are measured as a percentage of merchandise sales 
merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location  branding  and competition 
our retail sales are seasonal 
our retail business segment operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
retail results of operations were impacted by an impairment charge related to goodwill during additional discussion of this charge follows below under goodwill impairment loss 
goodwill impairment loss 
under our policy we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if indications of impairment exist 
various indications of possible goodwill impairment prompted us to perform a goodwill impairment analysis at march  we determined that no such impairment existed as of that date 
our last annual impairment test was performed as of june  the performance of the test is a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
from the first to the second quarter of  there was a decline in margins within the refining industry as well as a downward change in industry analysts forecasts for the remainder of and this  along with other negative financial forecasts released by independent refiners during the latter part of the second quarter of  contributed to declines in common stock trading prices within the independent refining sector  including declines in our common stock trading price 
as a result  our equity market capitalization fell below the net book value of our assets 
through the filing date of our second quarter of form q and through the end of the fourth quarter of  the trading price of our stock had experienced further reductions 
we completed step of the impairment test during the second quarter of and concluded that impairment existed 
consistent with the preliminary step analysis completed during the second quarter of  we concluded that our entire goodwill balance was impaired 
the resulting non cash charges for our refining  wholesale  and retail segments of million  million  and million  respectively  were reported in our second quarter of results of operations 
we finalized our step analysis during the third quarter of there were no such impairment charges in previous years 

table of contents long lived asset impairment losses 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our plans to indefinitely suspend the refining operations at our bloomfield refinery and operate the site as a product distribution terminal and crude oil storage facility 
accordingly  we tested our bloomfield refinery long lived assets and certain intangible assets for recoverability and determined that million of certain refinery related long lived and intangible assets were impaired 
during the fourth quarters of and  we recorded additional impairment charges of million and million  respectively  resulting from our fourth quarters and analyses of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
based on the sustainable operational improvements of our gallup refinery during that were beyond what we had anticipated at the time of the bloomfield refinery idling  we determined that one of the three assets set aside for relocation to gallup was no longer required to attain our desired levels of production 
our fourth quarter analysis demonstrated that existing market conditions and availability of superior economic alternatives further reduced the potential benefit of relocating bloomfield assets to the gallup refinery  resulting in impairment of the two remaining assets initially set aside for relocation 
all of these non cash impairment losses are included under loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in september  we temporarily suspended refining operations at our yorktown facility 
we took this action because narrow heavy light crude oil differentials and other continuing unfavorable economic conditions that began in the second quarter of precluded us from profitably operating the refinery 
we performed an impairment analysis at that time in connection with the temporary suspension of our yorktown refining operations 
based on that analysis  we determined that the undiscounted forecasted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of our yorktown long lived and intangible assets and thus  no impairment was recorded 
throughout the period that refining operations were suspended through the date of the sale of our yorktown facility  we routinely monitored refining industry market data  including crack spread and heavy light crude oil differential forecasts and other refining industry market data to determine whether assumptions used in our impairment analysis should be revised or updated 
our impairment analysis included considerable estimates and judgment  the most significant of which was the restart of refining operations during the latter part of on november   we announced that we had entered into agreements to sell the yorktown refining and terminal asset facilities  which transaction closed on december  the sales agreements also provided for the transfer of virtually all yorktown related remediation liabilities to the buyer and an equal sharing of future net proceeds if the yorktown refining assets are sold 
we retained our east coast wholesale business and continue to market finished products in the mid atlantic region 
this transaction allowed us to monetize the yorktown assets and exit the volatile east coast refining market 
continued extreme volatility of refining economics on the east coast  with a noticeable decline during the latter part of in forecasted east coast refining margins and the announcements during the latter part of of additional east coast refining facility closures  significantly reduced the probability of restarting refining operations at yorktown 
in addition  during the latter part of  we became aware of potential changes in pricing methodology of crude oils used for production at the yorktown facility from one based on wti to one based on brent 
as a result of our fourth quarter decision to sell the yorktown facility  we recorded a loss of million  including transaction costs of million 
this loss has been included in loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in a separate transaction with the third party buyer of the yorktown facility  we also sold an mile section of our texas new mexico crude pipeline 
prior to the sale of the section of the line  the texas new mexico pipeline extended miles from southeast to northwest new mexico 
the sale of this segment of pipeline resulted in a gain of million  including transaction costs of million 
we performed an impairment analysis on the remaining miles of our pipeline in connection with the sale and determined that no impairment of our remaining pipeline system existed as of december  this gain has been included in loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  factors impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 

table of contents senior secured notes  convertible senior notes  and equity offering during the second and third quarters of  we issued million in senior secured notes and million in convertible senior notes 
the senior secured notes consist of two tranches  the first consisting of million in fixed rate aggregate principal amount notes and the second consisting of million floating rate aggregate principal amount notes 
the interest rate on the floating rate notes was at issuance in june proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes  net of original issue and underwriting discounts were million 
the convertible senior notes consist of million in aggregate principal amount notes 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible senior notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes were million  net of underwriting discounts 
during the second quarter of  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million 
the proceeds of this issuance were million  net of million in underwriting discounts 
the combined proceeds from the issuance and sale of the senior secured notes  the convertible senior notes  and our common stock were used to retire million of our outstanding indebtedness under our term loan credit agreement 
in december  we redeemed the entire tranche of floating rate notes at a premium to par of 
the floating rate notes paid interest quarterly at a per annum rate  reset quarterly  equal to three month libor subject to a libor floor of plus 
through december   the interest rate on the floating rate notes was 
see note  long term debt  and note  stockholders equity  in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more detailed information 
asset impairments and disposals during the fourth quarter of  we entered into two separate agreements for the sale of our yorktown  virginia  refining and terminal assets and an mile section of our mile crude oil pipeline system in southeast new mexico 
gross proceeds for these two asset sales totaled million  resulting in a loss on disposal of the yorktown assets of million and a gain on disposal of the mile pipeline section of million 
during the first quarter of  we sold platinum assets from our yorktown refinery 
gross proceeds on the sale totaled million resulting in a gain on the sale of million 
a loss of million related to these disposals has been included in loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ending december  in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the indefinite suspension of refining operations at our bloomfield refinery  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to long lived and intangible assets 
during the fourth quarters of and  respectively  we recorded additional impairment charges of million and million resulting from our and fourth quarter analyses of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
these non cash impairment losses are included in loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we completed an impairment analysis of the long lived assets at our flagstaff  arizona  product distribution terminal following our permanent closure of the facility in the third quarter of the analysis determined that impairment existed  and we accordingly recorded a third quarter non cash impairment charge of million related to flagstaff terminal long lived assets 
this charge is included under other loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the second quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and as a result concluded that all of our goodwill was impaired 
the resulting non cash charge of million was reported in our second quarter results of operations 
this charge is included under goodwill impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  employee benefit plans through december   the company had distributed million million in and million in from plan assets to plan participants as a result of the temporary idling of yorktown refining operations in and resultant termination of several participants of the yorktown cash balance plan 
the company contributed million to its yorktown pension plan during the company expects to contribute million to its yorktown pension plan in subject to a memorandum of understanding between western refining yorktown  inc and the union representing the yorktown refinery employees  eligible terminated employees  both bargained for and non bargained for  were given the option of receiving severance pay or coverage under the yorktown retiree medical plan  but not both 
the resulting choices made by the terminated employees reduced our benefits obligation by million as of december  an increase of million 
table of contents in and a decrease of million in 
currently  we do not plan to terminate the yorktown retiree medical plan 
during we terminated our defined benefit plan covering certain el paso refinery employees 
the termination resulted in a reduction to our related pension obligation of million with a corresponding reduction of million before the effect of income taxes to other comprehensive loss 
debt extinguishments and write off of unamortized loan fees on december   we retired million of our floating rate notes at an aggregate redemption price of million  including a percent premium for early retirement 
including the write off of related unamortized debt costs  we incurred a loss of million 
this loss has been included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  on march   we amended and restated our term loan agreement 
to effect this amendment and restatement  we paid million in amendment fees 
as a result of the amendment and restatement  we recorded a loss of million that has been included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the second and third quarters of  we made principal payments on our term loan of million primarily from the net proceeds of our debt and common stock offerings 
accordingly  we expensed million during the second quarter of to write off a portion of the unamortized loan fees related to the term loan 
in june  we amended our revolving credit agreement and term loan 
as a result of such amendment  we recorded an expense of million related to the write off of deferred loan fees 
we completed an additional amendment to our revolving credit agreement in december we amortize all fees incurred as a result of this amendment  along with all unamortized loan fees related to the revolving credit agreement prior to this amendment  ratably through the amended maturity date of january see note  long term debt  in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on our long term debt 
commodity hedging activities  environmental cost recoveries  property tax refunds  and other our operating results for the year ended december  included realized and unrealized net gains from our commodity hedging activities of million compared to net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the current year results are primarily the result of our use of swap contracts for the purpose of fixing the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production 
see note  crude oil and refined product risk management  in notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on our commodity hedging activities 
our income tax provision for the year ended december  includes the effects of a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets for virginia and maryland generated through the operations of the yorktown facility prior to the sale of the facility in december during the latter part of march  we reversed million related to our accrued bonus for this revision of our bonus estimate reduced direct operating expenses and selling  general  and administrative expenses for by million and million  respectively 
during  we recovered million from various third parties related to environmental costs recorded during and prior years 
these recoveries are included in direct operating expenses reported for the year ended december  additionally  during  we decreased our property tax expense estimate by million resulting from revised el paso property appraisal rolls for through the revision to the property appraisal rolls also resulted in a refund of million from various taxing authorities  further reducing our property tax expense for a total decrease of million for the year ended december  we also recorded a fourth quarter legal settlement charge of million 
planned maintenance turnaround during the years ended december    and  we incurred costs of million  million  and million  respectively  for maintenance turnarounds 
costs incurred during related to the planned fourth quarter turnaround for gallup 
during  we incurred costs of million in connection with a maintenance turnaround at the el paso refinery 
primarily during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred costs of million in a crude unit shutdown and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the first quarter of at the el paso refinery  and million in connection with the planned turnaround in the third quarter of at the yorktown refinery  which was subsequently cancelled 
our next scheduled maintenance turnarounds are during the fourth quarter of for gallup and the first quarter of for el paso 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
most of our competitors  however  capitalize and amortize maintenance turnarounds 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective assumptions by management  which can materially impact reported results 
changes in these estimates or assumptions  or actual results that are different  could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
inventories 
crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally under the lifo valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues 
ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net realizable market values and charged to cost of products sold in the period recorded 
in subsequent periods  a new lower of cost or market determination is made based upon current circumstances 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
we determine market value inventory adjustments by evaluating crude oil  refined products  and other inventories on an aggregate basis by geographic region 
retail refined product fuel inventory values are determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
retail merchandise inventory value is determined under the retail inventory method 
wholesale refined product  lubricant  and related inventories are determined using the fifo inventory valuation method 
refined product inventories originate from either our refineries or from third party purchases 
maintenance turnaround expense 
the units at our refineries require periodic maintenance and repairs commonly referred to as turnarounds 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit but generally is every two to six years depending on the processing unit involved 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
these costs are identified as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets 
when assets are placed in service  we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives 
for assets to be disposed of  we report long lived assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in order to test our long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated  which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is carried at cost 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment if any events and circumstances arise during a quarter that indicates goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment 
within our refining segment  we have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
our wholesale and retail segments are considered reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment 
we do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes 
we amortize intangible assets  such as rights of way  licenses  and permits over their economic useful lives  unless the economic useful lives of the assets are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is determined to be indefinite  then that asset is not amortized 
we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset when the intangible asset is acquired 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our existing intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 

table of contents environmental and other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities for loss contingencies  including environmental remediation costs  when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
environmental costs are expensed if they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations with no future economic benefit 
estimates of projected environmental costs are made based upon internal and third party assessments of contamination  available remediation technology  and environmental regulations 
loss contingency accruals  including those for environmental remediation  are subject to revision as further information develops or circumstances change and such accruals can take into account the legal liability of other parties 
as a result of purchase accounting related to the giant acquisition  the majority of our environmental obligations assumed in the acquisition of giant are recorded on a discounted basis 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate is used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than other  the lower end of the range is used 
possible recoveries of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the financial statements until they become probable 
legal costs associated with environmental remediation are included as part of the estimated liability 
asset retirement obligations  or aro 
the estimated fair value of an aro is based on the estimated current cost escalated by an inflation rate and discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate 
this liability is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset and amortized using the straight line method 
the liability accretes until we settle the liability 
legally restricted assets have been set aside for purposes of settling certain of the aro liabilities 
financial instruments and fair value 
we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices 
we use commodity future contracts  price swaps  and options to reduce price volatility  to fix margins for refined products  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and blendstock inventories 
we recognize all the commodity hedge transactions that we enter as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and those instruments are measured at fair value 
for instruments used to mitigate the change in value of volumes subject to market prices  the company elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for financial accounting purposes  generally because of the difficulty of establishing the required documentation that would allow for hedge accounting at the date that the hedging instrument is entered into 
the swap contracts used to fix the margin on a portion of the company s future gasoline and distillate production do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these commodity hedging instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are recognized within cost of products sold using mark to market accounting 
pension and other postretirement obligations 
pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  future compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  health care cost trends  and demographic data 
changes in our actuarial assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control and can have a significant effect on our pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs 
a defined benefit postretirement plan sponsor must a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or liability for the plan s underfunded status  b measure the plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  as a component of other comprehensive income  the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
stock based compensation 
the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments awarded under the western refining long term incentive plan is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of each share of restricted stock awarded is measured based on the market price at closing as of the measurement date and is amortized on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods 
recent accounting pronouncements the accounting provisions covering the presentation of comprehensive income were amended to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income loss  the components of net income loss  and the components of other comprehensive income loss either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
these provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after december   and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance effective january  will not affect the company s financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affect disclosures 
the accounting provisions covering fair value measurements and disclosures were amended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and to change certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
amendments that change measurement and disclosure requirements relate to i fair value measurement of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  ii application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and iii additional disclosures about fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
these provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance 
table of contents effective january  will not affect the company s financial position or results of operations  but may result in additional disclosures

this increase was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge in outlook the weak global economy over the past two years has resulted in decreased demand for refined products 
the decreased demand along with narrowing differentials between light and heavy crude oil prices negatively impacted our refining margins through the first quarter of and all of beginning in the second quarter of  our refining margins in the southwest improved somewhat due to increased demand  primarily for diesel fuel 
during  our refining margins continued to strengthen 
this strengthening was due to a combination of factors including increased gasoline crack spreads  continued strong diesel demand  and the continued widening of the discount of wti crude oil to brent crude throughout most of this was a positive development for us as all of our crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to wti 
thus far during the first quarter of  these factors appear as if they will largely remain stable  which should result in continuing strong margins 
nevertheless  our margins have shown significant volatility in recent periods and this volatility could return for any number of reasons discussed elsewhere in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities  existing cash balances  and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  million in non current restricted cash  and million in gross availability under the revolving credit agreement  of which million was used for outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had no direct borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the million of restricted cash is considered restricted as the cash was the net proceeds we received from the sale of the yorktown assets and a portion of the pipeline in new mexico  of which both assets are subject to lien restrictions in our debt agreements 
we have indicated to our holders of debt that we intend to use the proceeds from the sale to reinvest within our business over a day period from december  and  if there are any remaining funds after the day period  to repay the term loan 
we continually evaluate additional alternatives to further improve our capital structure by increasing our cash balances and or reducing or refinancing a portion of the remaining balance on our long term debt 
these alternatives include various strategic initiatives and potential asset sales as well as potential public or private equity or debt financings 
we may also prepay certain of our long term debt 
if additional funds are obtained by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders could be diluted 
we can give no assurances that we will be able to sell any of our assets or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  our future capital expenditures and other cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors described in part i

regulatory projects 
regulatory projects are undertaken to comply with various regulatory requirements  including those related to environmental  health  and safety matters 
our low sulfur fuel and low benzene gasoline projects are regulatory investments driven primarily by fuels regulations 
we completed our capital projects to comply with the epa s low sulfur gasoline regulations during the deadline for compliance with the final phase of the ultra low sulfur diesel regulations to reduce sulfur in locomotive and marine diesel is june and affects our el paso refinery only

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk changes in commodity prices and interest rates are our primary sources of market risk 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations 
our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices  which depend on many factors  including demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the economy  worldwide production levels  worldwide inventory levels  and governmental regulatory initiatives 
our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations or to fix sales margins on future gasoline and distillate production 
in order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility  we have generally applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level 
in the past  circumstances have occurred  such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand  that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level 
we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances 
we maintain inventories of crude oil  other feedstocks and blendstocks  and refined products  the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic conditions  regional and global inventory levels  and seasonal conditions 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   the excess of the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories over aggregated lifo costs was million 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   the excess of the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories over aggregated lifo costs was million 
all commodity futures contracts  price swaps  and options are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recorded under cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of operations 
we selectively utilize commodity hedging instruments to manage our price exposure to our lifo inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes 
the commodity hedging instruments may take the form of futures contracts  price and crack spread swaps  or options and are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy
