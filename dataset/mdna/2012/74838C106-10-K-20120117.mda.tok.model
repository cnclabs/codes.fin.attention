item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors  set forth in item a above 
overview we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in australia 
our product offerings expanded in the s as we expanded our distribution channels 
after going public in and purchasing the rights to the quiksilver brand in the united states  we further expanded our product offerings and began to diversify 
in  we acquired the european licensee of quiksilver and introduced roxy  our surf brand for teenage girls 
we also expanded demographically in the s by adding products for boys  girls  toddlers and men  and we introduced our proprietary retail store concept that displays the heritage and products of quiksilver and roxy 
in  we acquired the international quiksilver and roxy trademarks  and in  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan 
in  we acquired dc shoes  inc to expand our presence in action sports inspired footwear 
in  we acquired skis rossignol sa  a wintersports and golf equipment company 
in november  we completed the sale of our rossignol wintersports business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of rossignol of approximately million  partially offset by a tax benefit of approximately million 
our rossignol business  including both wintersports equipment and related apparel  is classified as discontinued operations 
also  as part of our acquisition of rossignol in  we acquired a majority interest in roger cleveland golf company  inc our golf 
table of contents equipment operations were subsequently sold in december and are also classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these dispositions  the following information has been adjusted to exclude both our rossignol wintersports and golf equipment businesses 
today  our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops  skate shops  snow shops and specialty stores 
we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  develop and distribute branded apparel  footwear  accessories and related products 
we operate in three segments  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
our americas segment includes revenues from the us  canada and latin america 
our european segment includes revenues primarily from europe  the middle east and africa 
our asia pacific segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 
revenues by segment from continuing operations are as follows year ended october  in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate operations total revenues  net we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain our consumer loyalty  our business will be negatively affected 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  technicians  researchers  merchandisers  pattern makers and contractors 
our team and the heritage and current strength of our brands has helped us remain competitive in our markets 
our success in the future will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to design products that are desirable in the marketplace and competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  technical specifications  distribution methods  price  customer service and intellectual property protection

table of contents our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable global economic conditions 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
when consumers reduce discretionary spending  purchases of apparel and footwear tend to decline 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending in the domestic and international economies or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our total net revenues increased in fiscal to  million from  million in fiscal in constant currency  net revenues increased compared to the prior year 
net revenues in each of our americas  europe and asia pacific segments include apparel  footwear  accessories and related products for our quiksilver  roxy  dc and other brands  which primarily include hawk  lib technologies  and gnu 
in order to better understand growth rates in our foreign operating segments  we make reference to constant currency 
constant currency improves visibility into actual growth rates as it adjusts for the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates from period to period 
constant currency is calculated by taking the ending foreign currency exchange rate for balance sheet items or the average foreign currency exchange rate for income statement items used in translation for the current period and applying that same rate to the prior period 
our european segment is translated into constant currency using euros and our asia pacific segment is translated into constant currency using australian dollars as these are the primary functional currencies of each operating segment 
as such  this methodology does not account for movements in individual currencies within a segment for example  non euro currencies within our european segment and japanese yen within our asia pacific segment 
a constant currency translation methodology that accounts for movements in each individual currency could yield a different result compared to one using only euros and australian dollars 
the following table presents revenues by segment in both historical currency and constant currency for the fiscal years ended october  and in thousands americas europe asia pacific corporate total historical currency as reported october  october  percentage increase constant currency current year exchange rates october  october  percentage increase decrease revenues in the americas increased to million for fiscal from million in the prior year  while european revenues increased to million from million and asia pacific revenues increased to million from million for those same periods

our european segment gross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of a smaller percentage of retail versus wholesale sales  as we operated fewer retail stores throughout europe during fiscal in our asia pacific segment  the gross profit margin decrease was primarily due to a smaller percentage of retail versus wholesale sales  partially offset by continued margin improvements at retail in japan  although  such improvements were somewhat muted due to the impact of the natural disasters that occurred in that market 
our gross profit margin in future periods may be negatively impacted by hedging rates that we effect in foreign currency exchange rates on the forward contracts we have entered into in order to hedge our inventory purchases

in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
an entity is also required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning november  and requires retrospective application 
as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income  the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
asu allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment and whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test currently required 
the updated guidance is effective for us on november   however early adoption is permitted 
based on our evaluation of this asu  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
we also use insurance on certain classes of receivables in our european segment 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks  licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have three reporting units under which we evaluate goodwill for impairment  the americas  europe and asia pacific 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market approach 
material assumptions in our test for impairment include future cash flows of each reporting unit  discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of value 
the discount rates used approximate our cost of capital 
future cash flows assume future levels of growth in each reporting unit s business 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value under the first step of our goodwill impairment test  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
as of october   the fair values of our americas  europe and asia pacific reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
however  due to the natural disasters that occurred in several of our markets within our asia pacific reporting unit during the first half of fiscal and their resulting impact on our business  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
based on the uncertainty of future growth rates and other assumptions used to estimate goodwill recoverability in our reporting units  future reductions in our expected cash flows for a reporting unit could cause a material impairment of goodwill 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
this determination was made in regards to certain deferred tax assets in our asia pacific segment during fiscal  resulting in an increase to tax expense of approximately million 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
on november   we adopted the authoritative guidance included in asc  income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
the application of this guidance can create significant variability in our tax rate from period to period based upon changes in or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions 
for example  during fiscal  we recognized million of income due to the settlement of uncertain tax positions 

table of contents stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest using the graded vested method over the requisite service period of the award 
for option valuation  we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards  stock price volatility and interest rates 
for performance based equity awards with stock price contingencies  we determine the fair value using a monte carlo simulation  which creates a normal distribution of future stock prices  which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our primary functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in asia pacific  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our primary functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and substantial portions of our european and asia pacific product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in our statement of operations 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into us dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign currency exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts in other comprehensive income or loss 
forward looking statements all statements included in this report  other than statements or characterizations of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the trends and uncertainties in our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
these forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our industry  management s beliefs  and certain assumptions made by us and speak only as of the date of this report 
forward looking statements can often be identified by words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  predicts  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  likely  should  would  could  potential  continue  ongoing  and similar expressions  and variations or negatives of these words 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections  guidance  forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances  including any underlying assumptions  are forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to achieve the financial results that we anticipate  future expenditures for capital projects  including the ongoing implementation of our global enterprise wide reporting system  increases in production costs and raw materials  particularly with respect to labor costs  deterioration of global economic conditions and credit and capital markets  our ability to continue to maintain our brand image and reputation  
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  our ability to remain compliant with our debt covenants  payments due on contractual commitments and other debt obligations  and changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements as a result of the risks described in item a 
risk factors included in this report  and other factors 
except as may be required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot assure you that the forward looking information contained herein will  in fact  transpire 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
before entering into various hedge transactions  we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy 
in this documentation  we identify the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
derivatives that do not qualify or are no longer deemed effective to qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
we did not have any non qualifying derivatives during the fiscal year ended october  for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur through october assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of losses  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next months 

table of contents we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results and distort comparisons from period to period 
we generally do not use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure as accounting rules do not allow such types of contracts to qualify for hedge accounting 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for our european segment because it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect on the translation of our reported results from our european segment 
in addition  the statements of operations of our asia pacific segment are translated from australian dollars and japanese yen into us dollars  and there is a negative effect on our reported results for our asia pacific segment when the us dollar is stronger in comparison to the australian dollar or japanese yen 
european revenues increased in euros during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated statements of operations  european revenues increased as a result of a stronger euro versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
asia pacific revenues decreased in australian dollars during the fiscal year ended october  compared to the fiscal year ended october  as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated statements of operations  asia pacific revenues increased as a result of a stronger australian dollar and japanese yen versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
interest rates a limited amount of our outstanding debt bears interest based on libor or euribor plus a credit spread 
effective interest rates  therefore  will move up or down depending on market conditions 
the credit spreads are subject to change based on financial performance and market conditions 
interest expense also includes financing fees and related costs and can be affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements upon translating non us dollar denominated interest expense into non us dollars for reporting purposes 
the approximate amount of our variable rate debt was million at october   and the weighted average effective interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by ie to approximately  our annual income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on the borrowing levels at the end of fiscal
