sharecare and discovery are related parties and the related revenues are included in our consolidated statements of operations under content and platform services from affiliates 
our brands segment is comprised of revenue generated from our owned and operated websites  including international website businesses based in brazil and china 
revenue generated on the two websites relate primarily to paid for impression and pay per performance ads 
in brazil  we generated revenue for the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
in china  we generated revenue for the years ended december  and  of approximately million and million  respectively 
cost of services cost of services includes the costs incurred to support our content and platform services business including labor  content and third party platform support services as well as ongoing third party costs to support our brands business  including the costs to acquire original content  translate and localize content from english to portuguese and chinese 
these costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of services is related to the decrease in revenues in addition to performing platform services projects in that had higher profitability margins than projects completed in operations selling  general and administrative expenses our total selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the increase is primarily related to an increase in stock compensation expense of million compared to the same period of in addition  the company incurred additional costs related to the cost saving measures implemented in brazil  china and united states operations 
these costs also included severance payments of million 
impairment loss during the quarter ended september   we made reductions in the number of personnel supporting our china business operations to better align with our new strategic direction 
this event directly impacted the company s expectations of revenues and growth rates 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other  we performed an assessment for impairment on our indefinite lived intangible asset  our license to operate in china  which had a carrying value of million prior to performing the assessment 
we used the cost approach instead of the discounted cash flow method used in the prior year due to a decrease in projected revenues and cost cutting measures enacted during the third quarter the reductions prompted a change in our assessment of the highest and best use of the asset from an in use premise to an in exchange valuation premise 
the cost approach uses the concept of depreciated replacement costs as an indicator of value 
as a result of the assessment  we concluded that the asset is impaired and its fair value is million at september  subsequently  we recorded a charge of million under the impairment loss line in our statement of operations for the quarter ended september  we believe that the fair value of the china license remained at million at december  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the slight decrease is due to certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized during the year interest expense interest expense was million during the year ended december  which is related to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the credit agreement entered into in march which expired in march and we chose not to request a renewal 
we had no interest expense in deferred income tax benefit during the year  we recorded million as a tax benefit due to the impairment charge against the license to operate in china 
loss in equity investment we account for our investment in sharecare under the equity method of accounting 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a loss in the equity investment of approximately million and approximately million  respectively  net of taxes 
the losses are related to major expenses that sharecare is incurring as it builds its business strategy 
liquidity and capital resources on february   the company entered into definitive equity financing agreements with accredited and institutional investors to raise funds in the amount of million through a private placement 
in connection with the transaction  the company issued to investors common stock priced at per share 
investors also received warrants to acquire shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  in the amount of of the number of shares of common stock that the investors purchased 
on february   the company received million in cash and issued to the investors a total of  shares of common stock and warrants to acquire an additional  shares of common stock 
on march   we entered into a senior revolving credit agreement with theorem capital  llc the lender pursuant to which the lender agreed to extend to the company a line of credit of up to million for a period of one year from march   subject to renewal by the lender  at its sole discretion  for an additional one year period 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we could  in our sole discretion  borrow from the lender up to million from time to time during the term of the credit agreement  in minimum loan amounts of  any borrowings under the credit agreement would be senior unsecured indebtedness of remark media and could be used for our working capital and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a fixed rate equal to per annum  payable on or before march   unless the line of credit was renewed and the payment date extended  in which case interest would be payable on or before march  during the term of the credit agreement  any principal amounts repaid by remark media could be re borrowed 
as of december   the company did not have any outstanding balance under the senior revolving credit agreement and no interest was incurred during interest expense showing in our consolidated statements of operations is related to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the senior revolving credit agreement 
the agreement expired on march  and we chose not to request an additional one year extension 
our cash balance was approximately million as of december  we believe that this balance along with the funds received through the above mentioned equity financing transaction will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we consistently monitor our cash position  and make operational changes as necessary to maintain our business objective of funding ongoing operations and related growth 
accordingly  we implemented cost savings measures in our brazil operations in february  and in our china operations in september it is important to note that all our content and platform service agreements expired in december the content and platform services business will have no revenues unless we enter into new services agreements with new customers 
we are actively seeking to expand our content platform services business to additional clients in  and we are continuing to evolve our technology platforms and brands to ensure we incorporate the latest in social media and content trends 
the table below summarizes the change in our statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows used in operating activities our net cash used in operating activities during decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in cash used was related to a decrease in accounts receivable at the end as compared to due to higher collections in the current year 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to additional capital expenditures for leasehold improvements in connection with relocating our corporate headquarters 
cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million which was related to payments of debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit agreement 
there was no cash used in financing activities during the year critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe that our critical accounting policies  revenue recognition  stock based compensation and long lived assets including goodwill  equity investments  and other intangible assets may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the service has been provided  and the other criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition have been met  namely  the fees we charge are fixed or determinable  we and our advertisers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions  and the collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from our owned and operated websites as visitors are exposed to or react to advertisements on our website 
we generate revenue from advertising in the form of sponsored links and image ads 
this includes both pay per performance ads and paid for impression advertising 
in the pay per performance model  we earn revenue based on the number of clicks associated with such ad  in the paid for impression model sponsorships  revenue is derived from the display of ads 
these revenues are classified within our brands segment 
we recognize content and platform services revenue at the time services are performed 
all of our services revenue is related to the design  development  hosting and other services required to launch and operate the sharecare  dailystrength and ask dr 
oz websites through our direct activities and management of third party vendors 
we also recognize content and platform services revenue on certain projects using a percentage of completion method 
sales are calculated based on the percentage that total costs incurred bear to total estimated costs at completion 
these revenues are classified within our content and platform services segment 
stock based compensation under the equity incentive plan adopted april   and the equity plan adopted june   as modified on december  the plans  remark media authorized a total of  shares for grant as part of a long term incentive plan to attract  retain and motivate its eligible executives  employees  officers  directors and consultants 
options to purchase common stock under the plans have been granted to our officers and employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
additionally in   and  we granted restricted shares to certain members of our board of directors and executives 
as of december   no options have been exercised under the plan 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with codification asc  compensation  stock compensation which requires us to recognize expense based on the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
asc requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of the stock based awards 
we have elected to use the black scholes options pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of stock option awards 
we measure stock based compensation based on the fair values of all stock based awards on the dates of grant  and recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line method over the vesting periods 
stock based compensation expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of property and equipment property and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in the business climate  the impact of significant customer losses  unanticipated current period operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
recoverability of property and equipment is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  property and equipment are grouped with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
impairment of investments investments are reviewed to determine if events have occurred which would indicate that a decrease in value has occurred which is other than temporary 
evidence of a loss in value might include  but would not necessarily be limited to  absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
we monitor our assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis 
no impairment charge has been recognized on our investment balances as of december  or impairment of definite lived intangible assets amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
we monitor our assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis 
we have no definite lived intangible assets at december  and goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment generally  we perform our annual assessment for impairment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  unless facts and circumstances require differently 
for goodwill  we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets  which are licenses to operate in china  for impairment by utilizing discounted cash flow models to estimate their fair values  as appropriate 
estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and our long lived intangible assets involve uncertainties  because management is required to develop numerous assumptions  including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs  capital expenditures  industry economic factors and future business strategy 
the variability of the factors that management uses to perform our impairment tests depend on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and cash flows 
all such factors are interdependent and  therefore  do not change in isolation 
accordingly  the accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors and other conditions 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred  determining the future cash flows for the assets involved and determining the proper discount rate to be applied in determining fair value 
the discounted cash flow approach was used in however  in the impairment assessment for  the company used the cost approach 
the change in the approach used in the impairment analysis of compared to was due to a major decrease in projected revenues as a result of costs saving measures implemented in september the reductions prompted a change in our assessment of the highest and best use of the asset from an in use premise to an in exchange valuation premise 
as a result  the income approach used in was no longer a valid approach for the analysis 
the cost approach uses the concept of depreciated replacement cost as an indicator of value and is based on the principle of substitution which holds that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the amount for which the asset could be replaced less the effects of physical  functional and external depreciation or obsolescence 
recent accounting pronouncements we are subject to recent accounting pronouncements  as described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item herein

generally  our foreign expenses are denominated in the same currency as the associated foreign revenue  and at this stage of our development  the exposure to rate changes is minimal 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivables

the remaining was denominated in brazilian reals  chinese renminbi or hong kong dollars 
the majority of our cash is placed with financial institutions we believe are of high credit quality 
our cash is maintained in bank deposit accounts  which  at times  exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe our cash is exposed to any significant credit risk 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure because the effects of the foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not currently significant 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments to mitigate any of our currency risks 
the net assets of our foreign operations at december   were approximately million
