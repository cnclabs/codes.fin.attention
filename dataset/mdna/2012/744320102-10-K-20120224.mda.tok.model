item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass six segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the us retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities  retirement and asset management segments 
the us individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments 
the international insurance division consists of our international insurance segment 
our corporate and other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments  as well as businesses that have been or will be divested 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which are reflected in corporate and other operations 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 

table of contents closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
at the time of demutualization  we determined the amount of closed block assets so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  holders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes  which we refer to as the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets that we must hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities  and certain other related assets and liabilities 
the closed block business is not a separate legal entity from the financial services businesses  however  they are operated as separate entities and are separated for financial reporting purposes 
the financial services businesses are not obligated to pay dividends on closed block policies 
dividends on closed block policies reflect the experience of the closed block over time and are subject to adjustment by prudential insurance s board of directors 
further  our plan of demutualization provides that we are not required to pay dividends on policies within the closed block from assets that are not within the closed block and that the establishment of the closed block does not represent a guarantee that any certain level of dividends will be maintained 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 

table of contents profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance and annuity products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance and annuity products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  which can fluctuate significantly from period to period  our actual policyholder behavior experience  including persistency  and benefit utilization and withdrawal rates for our variable annuity contracts  which could deviate significantly from our pricing assumptions  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our ability to manage and control our operating expenses  including overhead expenses  our returns on invested assets  including the impact of credit losses  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  our assumptions with respect to rates of return  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation  and where available and appropriate  our ability to take timely crediting rate actions to maintain investment spread margins  our credit and financial strength ratings  our ability to effectively utilize our tax capacity  our returns on strategic investments we make  our ability to manage risk and exposures  including the degree to which  and the effectiveness of  hedging these risks and exposures  our ability to effectively deploy capital  and our ability to attract and retain talent 
in addition  factors such as credit and real estate market conditions  regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  market fluctuations and general economic  market and political conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 

table of contents see risk factors for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
executive summary prudential financial  a financial services leader with approximately billion of assets under management as of december   has operations in the united states  asia  europe and latin america 
through our subsidiaries and affiliates  we offer a wide array of financial products and services  including life insurance  annuities  retirement related services  mutual funds  and investment management 
we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
industry trends our us and international businesses are impacted by financial markets  economic conditions  regulatory oversight  and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete 
us businesses financial and economic environment 
our businesses and results of operations are impacted by general economic and market conditions and are sensitive to the pace of and extent of changes in equity markets  interest rates and real estate valuations  as well as the changes in behavior of individuals and institutions that these changes in economic and market conditions may cause 
recent years have been affected by adverse global market conditions  and uncertainty continues to be a factor in the market environment 
this uncertainty  particularly in the equity markets  has led to  among other things  increased demand for guaranteed retirement income  fixed income and stable value products  and defined benefit risk transfer solutions 
volatile conditions continue to characterize the overall financial markets 
the low interest rate environment we have experienced in recent years has impacted the profitability of certain products we offer as well as returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities and equity 
disruptions in the credit markets have also limited sales opportunities in recent years for certain products we offer and have impacted the cost and implementation of our capital management activities by reducing the availability of financing 
continued high unemployment rates and limited growth in salaries also continue to be factors impacting certain business drivers  including contributions to defined contribution plans and the costs of group disability claims 
regulatory environment 
our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision 
the financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced  and are expected to continue to produce  extensive changes in existing laws and regulations  and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses 
in particular  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act signed into law on july  made comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the us and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation 
in addition  state insurance laws regulate all aspects of our us insurance businesses and our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws 
insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital  particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities  and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements for life insurance products 
in addition  there is general uncertainty regarding us taxes both for individuals and corporations in light of the fact that many tax provisions recently enacted or extended will sunset by the end of in addition  the recommendations made by the president s bipartisan national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform and other deficit reduction panels suggest the need to reform the us tax code 
congress has held a number of hearings devoted to tax reform 
some of those hearings have discussed lowering the tax rates and broadening the base by reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures 
reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures could make our products less attractive to customers 
it is unclear whether or when congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the company and its products 

table of contents demographics 
income protection  wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to shape the insurance industry 
retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the us for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them 
the risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to shift to employees  away from the government and employers 
life insurance ownership among us households has reached its lowest point in fifty years  with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of coverage 
competitive environment 
our annuities  retirement and asset management businesses operate in a highly competitive environment 
for the annuities business  market volatility in recent years led many companies within the industry to reduce risk in product features and increase costs 
however  in  certain of our competitors became more aggressive in product design and pricing  while we implemented modifications to scale back benefits and increase pricing for certain product features 
in spite of this  we believe our current product offerings remain competitively positioned and that our differentiated risk management strategies will continue to provide us with an attractive risk and profitability profile 
all of our new variable annuity sales  as well as a significant portion of our in force business  where an optional living benefit has been elected  include an automatic rebalancing feature  which is a feature that is valued in the variable annuity market 
our retirement and asset management businesses compete on price  service and investment performance 
the full service retirement markets are mature  with few dominant players 
we have seen a trend toward unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings  where the variety of available funds and their performance are the key selection criteria of plan sponsors and intermediaries 
additionally  changes in the regulatory environment have driven more transparent fee disclosures  which have heightened pricing pressures and may accelerate the trend toward unbundling of services 
market disruption and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our institutional investment product competitors to withdraw from the market  creating significant growth opportunities for us in certain markets  including the investment only stable value market 
the recovery of the equity  fixed income  and commercial real estate markets has positively impacted asset managers by increasing assets under management and corresponding fee levels 
in addition  institutional fixed income managers have generally experienced positive flows as investors have re allocated assets into fixed income to reduce risk  including the reduction of risk in pension plans 
the individual life and group life and disability markets are mature and  due to the large number of competitors  competition is driven mainly by price and service 
the economy has exacerbated pressure on pricing  creating an even greater challenge of maintaining pricing discipline 
this has limited growth of our individual life sales  in an industry which has shifted toward non proprietary distribution channels  which are more price sensitive than proprietary distribution channels 
for group products  rate guarantees have become the industry norm  with rate guarantee durations trending upward  primarily for group life insurance  as a general industry practice 
there is also an increased demand from clients for bundling of products and services to streamline administration and save costs by dealing with fewer carriers 
as employers are attempting to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees  who continue to value benefits offered in the workplace  employee pay voluntary product offerings and services are becoming increasingly important in the group market 
industry sales of voluntary products  as well as our own  were up again in despite the adverse economic conditions 
international businesses financial and economic environment 
our international businesses and the financial results of these operations are impacted by the global economy as well as the financial and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates 
similar to our us businesses  interest rates and the pace and extent of changes in rates have impacted the profitability of certain products we offer by impacting the returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities as well as on the equity in the businesses 
our japanese operations have operated in this environment for an extended period 
we are also subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates  particularly the japanese yen 
the strengthening of the yen has increased the attractiveness of multi currency denominated products 
regulatory environment 
our international insurance and investments operations are subject to comprehensive local regulation and supervision 
it is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead 
table of contents to changes in existing laws and regulations  and regulatory frameworks affecting our international businesses 
the financial services agency  the insurance regulator in japan  has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company s core capital is calculated 
these changes are effective for the fiscal year ending march  we anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory developments in the us  the european union  and recommendations by an international standard setting body for the insurance regulators  as well as regulatory requirements for those companies deemed to be systemically important financial institutions  or sifis  in the us or abroad 
in addition  local regulations  primarily in japan  may apply heightened scrutiny to non domestic companies 
internationally  regulators are also increasingly adopting measures to provide greater consumer protection and privacy rights 
demographics 
japan has a rapidly aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low yielding deposit and savings vehicles 
the aging of japan s population as well as strains on government pension programs have led to a growing demand for insurance products with a savings element to meet savings and retirement needs as the population transitions to retirement 
the growing demand for retirement oriented products has led to higher premiums with more of a savings component 
we are seeing a similar shift to retirement oriented products in korea and taiwan  each of which also has an aging population 
competitive environment 
the life insurance markets in japan and korea are mature 
we generally compete more on service provided to the customers than on price 
the aging of japan s population creates an increasing need for product innovation  introducing insurance products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement 
the ability to sell through multiple and complementary distribution channels is a competitive advantage 
however  competition for sales personnel as well as access to third party distribution channels is intense

such limitation will allow us to deregister as a savings and loan holding company

table of contents results of operations we analyze performance of the segments and corporate and other operations of the financial services businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations segment measures for a discussion of adjusted operating income and its use as a measure of segment operating performance

excluding these items  results increased in comparison to the prior year  primarily reflecting higher fee income resulting from the impact of positive net flows on variable annuity account values 

table of contents retirement segment results for increased in comparison to the increase reflects higher fee income due to higher fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business primarily from net additions and an increase in average full service fee based retirement account values resulting primarily from market appreciation 
this increase was partially offset by lower net investment spread results  higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  and the unfavorable impact of annual reviews and updates of the assumptions used in amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
asset management segment results improved in in comparison to primarily from improved results from the segment s commercial mortgage and strategic investing activities and increased asset management fees 
individual life segment results for increased in comparison to primarily driven by a greater benefit in from annual updates of our actuarial assumptions resulting in lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  and a net decrease in insurance reserves 
the benefit was million  compared to a benefit of million in absent the impact of these annual reviews  results for decreased million from primarily due to an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves  largely reflecting the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods  partially offset by the impact of less unfavorable mortality experience 
group insurance segment results declined in  compared to primarily due to less favorable group disability underwriting results and higher expenses  largely offset by more favorable group life underwriting results 
international insurance segment results for improved from results from the segment s life planner operations improved in  reflecting the continued growth of our japanese life planner operation and lower expenses  partially offset by claims resulting from the march earthquake and tsunami and less favorable mortality experience 
results from the segment s gibraltar life and other operations reflect the comparative impact of a million benefit to results compared to a million benefit to resulting from partial sales of our investment  through a consortium  in china pacific group 
also contributing to the increase in adjusted income was million of earnings from operations of the acquired star and edison businesses  excluding claims resulting from the march earthquake and tsunami  and a million gain on sale of our investment in afore xxi 
these benefits were partially offset by million of star and edison acquisition and integration related expenses and million of charges primarily resulting from claims associated with the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
the remainder of the improvements in results compared to the prior year quarter came primarily from a greater contribution from investment results  reflecting business growth including higher earnings from our fixed annuities business and from expanding bank channel sales of protection products 
corporate and other operations resulted in an increased loss for as compared to primarily due to a higher level of expenses in other corporate activities  including a million increase in expenses for estimated payments arising from use of new social security master death file matching criteria to identify deceased policyholders and contractholders and a million charge related to a voluntary contribution to an insurance industry insolvency fund  related to executive life insurance company of new york 
income from continuing operations before income taxes in the closed block business decreased million in compared to  primarily reflecting an increase in the policyholder dividend obligation expense 
accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the 
table of contents preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
deferred policy acquisition and other costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs primarily include commissions  costs of policy issuance and underwriting  and variable field office expenses that are incurred in producing new business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the new authoritative guidance adopted effective january   regarding which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
we also defer costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our individual annuities segment 
sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract 
for additional information about sales inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and deferred sales inducements  or dsi  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as described in more detail below  in calculating dac and dsi amortization  we are required to make assumptions about investment returns  mortality  persistency  and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums 
as of december   dac and dsi in our financial services businesses were billion and billion  respectively  and dac in our closed block business was million 
amortization methodologies dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
we also evaluate the recoverability of the dac balance at the end of each reporting period 
these dac adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders and  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  changes in gross margins and dac amortization would result in a net impact to the closed block business results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the non participating whole life  term life  endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 
we evaluate the recoverability of our dac related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing 
if a premium deficiency exists  we reduce dac by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we reduce the dac balance to zero and increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
generally  we do not expect significant deterioration in future experience  and therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related dac 
dac and dsi associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments are amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to total gross 
table of contents profits 
dac and dsi are also subject to recoverability testing which we perform at the end of each reporting period to ensure that each balance does not exceed the present value of estimated gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits 
total gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits 
adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions  our quarterly adjustments for current period experience  and our quarterly adjustments for market performance 
each of these adjustments is further discussed below in annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments 
in addition to the gross profit components mentioned above  we also include the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization 
prior to the third quarter of  we also included the impact of these embedded derivatives and related hedging activities  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  in our estimate of total gross profits used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy  which resulted in a change in how certain gross profit components are used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
prior to the third quarter of our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  with capital market derivatives 
under our current hedging strategy  our hedge target continues to be grounded in a us gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates two modifications to the us gaap valuation assumptions 
we add a credit spread to the us gaap risk free rate of return assumption used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk 
we also adjust our volatility assumption to remove certain risk margins embedded in the valuation technique used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative liability under us gaap  as we believe the increase in the liability driven by these margins is temporary and does not reflect the economic value of the liability 
for a discussion of the change in our hedging strategy and the results of our hedging program  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions 
as mentioned above  this change in our hedging strategy also led to a change in the components included in our estimate of total gross profits used to determine the dac and dsi amortization rates 
beginning in the third quarter of  management s best estimate of the total gross profits associated with these optional living benefit features and related hedge positions is based on the updated hedge target definition as described above 
however  total gross profits for these purposes includes the difference between the change in the value of the hedge target liability and the change in the asset value only to the extent this net amount is determined by management to be other than temporary  as well as the impact of assumption updates on the valuation of the hedge target liability 
the determination of whether the difference between the change in the value of the hedge target liability and the change in the asset value is other than temporary is based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge program 
management generally expects differences between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value to be temporary and to reverse over time 
such differences would not be included in total gross profits for purposes of determining the amortization rates 
however  based on the effectiveness of the hedge program  management may determine that the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and the asset value is other than temporary and would include that amount in our best estimate of total gross profits for setting the dac and dsi amortization rates 
management may also decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from the hedge target definition  given overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing market conditions 
the impact from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from the hedge target definition  as well as the results of the capital hedge program we began in the second quarter of and modified in  are not considered in calculating total gross profits used to determine amortization rates nor included in actual gross profits used in calculating current period amortization as these items are related to capital considerations and are not directly related to product profits 

table of contents annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments annually  during the third quarter  we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods 
although we review these assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year  we generally only update these assumptions and adjust the dac and dsi balances during the third quarter  unless a material change that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac and dsi have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions  mortality  and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
we expect these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause potential significant changes in the future 
the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change 
in these cases  we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods amortization  also referred to as an experience true up adjustment 
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance 
a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and  to a lesser degree  our variable life policies are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances  which increase the fees we earn and decrease the costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts 
the impact of increased fees results in higher expected future gross profits and lower dac and dsi amortization for the period 
the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations 
the changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods amortization 
the near term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac and dsi for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over the next four years the near term so that the assets are projected to grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
unless there is a sustained interim deviation  our long term expected rate of return assumptions are generally not impacted by short term market fluctuations 
if the near term projected future rate of return is greater than our near term maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum future rate of return 
the following table sets forth the weighted average rate of return assumptions  per annum  for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance businesses as of december  variable annuities variable life insurance long term equity expected rate of return fixed income expected rate of return long term blended expected rate of return near term maximum equity rate of return fixed income expected rate of return blended maximum expected rate of return near term mean reversion blended rate of return fixed income expected rate of return for our variable annuities business is a levelized rate  blending current rates and long term expected returns 
fixed income expected rate of return for our variable life insurance business is the long term expected return  as a blend does not materially affect results due to the long duration of the liability 
blend is based on the long term expected distribution of funds between equity and fixed income funds 
as of december   more than half of our variable annuities business and the majority of our variable life insurance business had near term mean reversion rates of return based on the blended maximum expected rate of return assumption 

table of contents the weighted average rate of return assumptions reflected in the table above are determined independently for variable annuities and variable life insurance and consider many factors specific to each business  including actual rates of return  liability durations  asset allocations and other factors 
we update the rates of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach 
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization  reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods gross profits 
the new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
sensitivity for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by

for a discussion of dac adjustments related to our individual life segment for the years ended december   and  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual life and group insurance division individual life 
for variable annuity contracts  dac and dsi are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
the dac and dsi balances associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts were billion and billion  respectively  as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter

value of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi  we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired  or voba 
voba includes an explicit adjustment to reflect the cost of capital attributable to the acquired insurance contracts  and represents an adjustment to the stated value of inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value  determined as of the acquisition date 
as of december   voba was  million  and included  million related to the acquisition from aig of the star and edison businesses on february  see note for additional information on the acquisition from aig of the star and edison businesses 
the remaining million relates to previously acquired traditional life  deferred annuity  defined contribution and defined benefit businesses 
voba is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts 
for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba is also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits 
based on this recoverability testing  in we impaired the entire remaining voba asset related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from allstate 
for additional information regarding this charge  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
goodwill as of december   our goodwill balance of million is reflected in the following four reporting units million related to our retirement full service business  million related to our asset management business  million related to our international insurance gibraltar business and million related to our international insurance life planner business 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not 
the test is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments 
accounting guidance allows a reporting unit to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if its goodwill is impaired 
factors such as macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  and others are used to assess the validity of the goodwill 
if it is determined that the reporting unit s fair value is not more likely than not below its carrying amount equity attributed to a business to support its risk  the test is complete and no impairment is recorded 
if this assertion cannot be made  a quantitative analysis must be performed 
a reporting unit may bypass the qualitative analysis and begin their impairment analysis with the quantitative calculation 
this option is unconditional and a reporting unit may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 

table of contents the quantitative analysis consists of two steps 
step requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be calculated and compared to the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value  it is concluded there is no impairment and the analysis is complete 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  step of the process is completed to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
step utilizes business combination acquisition accounting guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit excluding goodwill  but including any unrecognized intangible assets 
the net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to the reporting unit s total fair value as calculated in step the excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to determine the reporting unit s goodwill impairment loss  if any 
a qualitative assessment was performed by international insurance s gibraltar business 
after consideration of the relevant macro economic factors  as well as conditions specific to the insurance industry and the reporting unit  it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was not more likely than not below its carrying value and accordingly  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the international insurance s life planner business and the asset management segment elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach 
the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors  including  but not limited to  financial risk  size  geographic diversification  profitability  adequate financial data  and an actively traded stock price 
a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts consensus estimates for each company s forecasted earnings 
the multiples are then aggregated and a mean and median multiple is calculated for the group 
the lower of the mean or median multiple is then applied to the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value 
a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit 
the retirement full service business also elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow approach 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these projected future cash flows were based on our internal forecasts  an expected growth rate and a terminal value 
the weighted average rate of return  or warr  represents the required rate of return on total capitalization 
it is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax affected cost of debt  which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt assumed in the capital structure 
to estimate the return on equity  we applied the capital asset pricing model  or capm 
the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor s return requirement  and hence a company s cost of equity capital 
capm is determined by beginning with the long term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility  small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company 
the warr calculation is applied to a group of companies considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit 
this process resulted in a discount rate of which was then applied to the expected future cash flows of the retirement full service business to estimate its fair value 
after completion of step of the quantitative tests  it was determined that fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for each of the three reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of december  the asset management  international insurance s life planner and retirement full service businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts by  and  respectively 
estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments 
the retirement full service business quantitative test is sensitive to a number of key assumptions 
for example  a decline in its forecasted cash flows of  an increase in the discount rate above  or an increase in the equity attributed to support this business representing the carrying value of could result in failing step of the quantitative test and therefore require a step assessment 
regarding all four reporting units 
table of contents tested  further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses  including discount rates  interest rates and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses  could result in goodwill impairments  resulting in a charge to income 
as of december   the company experienced a market capitalization that was below its consolidated book value 
an analysis was performed in order to confirm the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment tests discussed above 
the company considered the fact that certain reporting units that do not contain goodwill have lower estimated fair values due to the nature of the risks in their businesses and also considered the negative impact of our corporate other operations on the overall fair value of the company 
the company also considered the amount of control premium necessary to estimate a fair value equal to book value 
when comparing this control premium to actual control premiums experienced in recent insurance company acquisitions  as well as the impact of the lower market environment which can increase industry control premiums  the company concluded that the calculated control premium reflected an amount which we believe is within a range of reasonableness 
based on these factors  the company concluded that the reporting unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment test were reasonable 
valuation of investments  including derivatives  and the recognition of other than temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities  other invested assets  and derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the values of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps  futures  forwards and options and may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market 
we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
management believes the following accounting policies related to investments  including derivatives  are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives  as referenced below 
valuation of investments  including derivatives recognition of other than temporary impairments determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  our derivatives  and our embedded derivatives at fair value in the statements of financial position

table of contents policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to  or on behalf of  policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued 
these reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our closed block business and the non participating whole life  term life  and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by us gaap 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policies 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
these gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in the closed block business results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts  and are determined in accordance with us gaap as the present value of expected future benefits to  or on behalf of  policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions about mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net us gaap liabilities us  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net us gaap liabilities are adjusted by first reducing the dac asset by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve by the excess  by means of a charge to current period earnings 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
unless a material change in mortality experience is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
generally  we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions about mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after our reserves are initially established  we perform premium 
table of contents deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves  the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount 
our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
although we review our mortality and retirement assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year  we generally only update these assumptions annually during the third quarter unless a material change in mortality or retirement experience is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the remaining of the reserves for future policy benefits as of december  represented reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment  and group life and disability and long term care benefits in our group insurance segment 
the optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives  with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 
in establishing reserves for gmdbs and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib s related to variable annuity contracts  we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization  contract lapses and contractholder mortality  as well as interest rates and equity market returns 
assumptions relating to contractholder behavior  such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses  are based on our experience by contract group  and vary by product type and year of issuance 
our dynamic lapse rate assumption applies a different lapse rate on a contract by contract basis based on a comparison of the gmdb or gmib and the current policyholder account value as well as other factors such as the applicability of any surrender charges 
in the money contracts are those with a gmdb or gmib in excess of the current policyholder account value 
since in the money contracts are less likely to lapse  we apply a lower lapse rate assumption to these contracts 
as an example  the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are not in the money and are out of their surrender charge period average between and per year  and the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are in the money and are out of their surrender charge period average between and per year 
mortality assumptions are generally based on our historical experience or standard industry tables  and also vary by contract group 
unless a material change in contractholder behavior or mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update assumptions related to contractholder behavior and mortality in the third quarter of each year by considering the actual results that have occurred during the period from the most recent update to the expected amounts 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates that have resulted in changes to our reserves for gmdbs and gmibs have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and can also impact our dac and other balances as discussed above 
generally  we do not expect our actual mortality trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
the future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs related to variable annuity contracts are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
for additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see  deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for gmdbs and gmibs related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes 
table of contents only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions  it is a near term  reasonably likely change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change 
this information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change in the reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency  mortality  or expenses included in our evaluation of the reserves  or any changes on dac or other balances  discussed above in deferred policy acquisition and other costs

unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion as of december  is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 
expected future claim payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability 
we review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations annually 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
recently  our claim termination experience has been impacted by increased volatility driven by the economic downturn 
if actual experience results in a different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
unearned revenue reserves for universal life and investment contracts our unearned revenue reserve  or urr  reported as a component of policyholders account balances  is billion as of december  this reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our individual life segment and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product s estimated gross profits  similar to dac as discussed above 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
the urr balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio

for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will decrease the discount rate to from in the expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to in from in  and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
at december   the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement obligations to a basis point change in discount rate was as follows december  increase decrease in pension benefits obligation increase decrease in accumulated postretirement benefits obligation increase in discount rate by basis points decrease in discount rate by basis points taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
the company does not provide us income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its non us operations  other than its operations in japan and certain operations in india  germany  and taiwan 

table of contents tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from when the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors  including the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  whether they are ordinary or capital  in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal  taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions  any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets  and any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in of million 
us gaap prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns 
the application of this guidance is a two step process  the first step being recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
our liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the irs or other taxing authorities 
the completion of review or the expiration of the federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes 
the federal statute of limitations for the tax year expired on april  the federal statute of limitations for the tax year expired on july  the federal statute of limitations for the through tax years will expire in june  unless extended 
tax years through are still open for irs examination 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact in and of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired 
the company s affiliates in japan and korea file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority 
the general statute of limitations for japan and korea are five years from when the return is filed 

table of contents reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated  such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
future adoption of new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
the company adopted this guidance effective january   and will apply the retrospective method of adoption 
we estimate that if the new guidance were adopted as of december   retrospective adoption would reduce deferred policy acquisition costs by approximately billion to billion for the financial services businesses and by approximately billion for the closed block business  increase policy reserves for certain limited pay contracts by approximately billion to billion for the financial services businesses  and reduce total equity by approximately billion to billion for the financial services businesses and approximately billion for the closed block business 
subsequent to the adoption of the guidance  the lower level of costs qualifying for deferral may be only partially offset by a lower level of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  and  as such  may initially result in lower earnings in future periods  primarily within the international insurance and individual annuities segments 
the impact to the international insurance segment largely reflects lower deferrals of allocated costs of its proprietary distribution system  while the impact to the individual annuities segment mainly reflects lower deferrals of its wholesaler costs 
while the adoption of this amended guidance changes the timing of when certain costs are reflected in the company s results of operations  it has no effect on the total acquisition costs to be recognized over time and will have no impact on the company s cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of newly issued accounting pronouncements  including further discussion of the new authoritative guidance addressing which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral

segment measures in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with authoritative guidance  is our measure of segment performance

adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income decreased million  from  million in to million in the decrease in adjusted operating income was driven by the impacts of a million net charge in the current year  and a million net benefit in the prior year  from adjustments to amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and other costs and to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib features of our variable annuity products  primarily driven by the impact to the estimated profitability of the business of quarterly adjustments to reflect current period market performance and experience  as well as the impact of annual reviews and updates of the assumptions used in estimating the profitability of our business 
results for both years include the impact of these items which are discussed in more detail below 
excluding the items discussed above  adjusted operating income increased million 
the increase was driven by higher fee income  net of distribution costs  due to higher average variable annuity account values invested in separate accounts primarily driven by positive net flows 
see account values below for a further discussion of our account values and sales 
the higher fee income was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  reflecting higher costs to support business growth and higher financing expenses  and the impact of a million benefit in from refinements based on a review and settlement of reinsurance contracts related to acquired business

represents the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as updates for current and future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb gmib features of our variable annuity products 
the million of charges and million of benefits in and  respectively  relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments shown in the table above are attributable to changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance 
the following table shows the actual quarterly rates of return on variable annuity account values compared to our previously expected quarterly rates of return used in our estimate of total gross profits for the periods indicated 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter actual rate of return expected rate of return overall lower than expected returns in decreased our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing dac and other costs and increased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products  by establishing a new  lower starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods 
this change results in a higher required rate of amortization and higher required reserve provisions  which are applied to all prior periods 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions are recognized in the current period 
overall higher than expected returns in had opposite impacts  resulting in an increase to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing dac and other costs and a decrease to our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products 
this change resulted in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions  which were applied to all prior periods 
as discussed and shown in the table above  results for both years include the impact of the annual reviews performed in the third quarter of the assumptions used in the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing dac and other costs 
the third quarter of included million of net benefits from these annual reviews  primarily related to a reduction of the assumption of the percentage of contracts with a gmib feature that will annuitize based on the guaranteed value  partially offset by a reduction of the weighted average future return assumption to on fixed rate portfolios 
the reduction in the weighted average future return assumption on fixed rate portfolios was driven by a refinement to our rate setting methodology to reflect a lower interest rate assumption for the next five years to reflect current market conditions  and use the long term assumed rate thereafter in determining the blended future return on fixed rate investments of 
the third quarter of included million of benefits from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in lapse rate assumptions and more favorable assumptions relating to fee income 

table of contents for a further discussion of the assumptions  including our current near term and long term projected rates of return  used in estimating total gross profits used as the basis for amortizing dac and other costs  and for estimating future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products  see accounting policies and pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates 
the million and million of benefits in and  respectively  shown in the table above  reflect the quarterly adjustments for current period experience and other updates  also referred to as experience true up adjustments 
the experience true up adjustments for include reductions to both the amortization of dac and other costs and the reserves related to the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products 
the reduction to the amortization of dac and other costs was driven by higher than expected gross profits primarily from lower than expected lapses  higher than expected fee income and higher than expected general account spreads 
the reduction to the reserves related to the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products was driven by lower than expected actual contract guarantee claim costs  higher than expected fee income and higher than expected general account spreads  partially offset by lower than expected lapses 
the experience true up adjustments for included a reduction in the amortization of dac and other costs driven by higher than expected gross profits primarily from higher than expected fee income  and a reduction to the reserves related to the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products driven by lower than expected actual contract guarantee claim costs  more favorable lapse experience and higher than expected fee income 
as noted previously  the quarterly adjustments to reflect current period market performance and experience and other updates  and the annual reviews and updates of assumptions impact the estimated profitability of our business 
therefore  in addition to the current period impacts discussed above  these items will also drive changes in our gmdb and gmib reserves and the amortization of dac and other costs in future periods 
additionally  in the third and fourth quarters of  we evaluated the results of our living benefits hedging program and determined the difference between the change in the value of the hedge target liability and the change in the fair value of the hedge assets to be other than temporary 
as a result  we included these amounts in our best estimate of total gross profits used for setting amortization rates  which will also drive changes in the amortization of dac and other costs in future periods 
the table above excludes the impacts of resetting the amortization rates for this item  as both the hedge results and related amortization of dac and other costs are excluded from adjusted operating income 
however  adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of includes the subsequent impact to base amortization from resetting the amortization rates at the end of the third quarter 
base amortization is calculated by applying the new rates to actual gross profits for the quarter 
see net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions for additional details on the impact of our hedge results that are excluded from adjusted operating income 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to  million in the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to an increase in fee income  net of higher distribution costs  driven by higher average variable annuity account values invested in separate accounts due to positive net flows and net market appreciation 
partially offsetting the increase in adjusted operating income was a million lower benefit related to adjustments to the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing dac and other costs

first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter actual rate of return expected rate of return actual returns exceeded our expected returns for which increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products  by establishing a new  higher starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods 
the expected rates of return in for some contract groups were based upon our maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach 
the overall increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions  which are applied to all prior periods 
the resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions was a million benefit for as shown in the table above 
the million of benefits for relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments is attributable to a similar impact on gross profits of market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products  reflecting financial market conditions during the period 
the benefit in is higher than that in due to a greater difference in between the actual rates of return and the expected rates of return 
also  the million decrease in amortization of dac and other costs in is net of a million charge to impair the entire remaining balance of value of business acquired  or voba  related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from the allstate corporation  or allstate  in the second quarter of the additional charge was required in the first quarter of  as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero 
since the voba balance was completely amortized for these contracts  it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods 
as discussed and shown in the table above  results for both periods also include the impact of the annual reviews performed in the third quarter of the assumptions used in the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing dac and other costs 
included million of benefits from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in lapse rate assumptions and more favorable assumptions relating to fee income 
included million of charges from these annual reviews  primarily related to reductions in the future rate of return assumptions applied to the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products 
partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions for were benefits related to the impact of lower mortality and higher investment spread assumptions 
the million benefit for and the million benefit for for the quarterly adjustments for current period experience and other updates shown in the table above primarily reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period  as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change  and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods amortization  also referred to as an experience true up adjustment  may be required in the current period 

table of contents this adjustment to previous periods amortization is in addition to the direct impact of actual gross profits on current period amortization and the market performance related adjustment to our estimates of gross profits for future periods 
the experience true up adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs for reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits  resulting primarily from higher than expected fee income 
the adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products in primarily reflects a reserve decrease driven by lower than expected actual contract guarantee claim costs  more favorable lapse experience  and higher than expected fee income 
the experience true up adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs for reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits

revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  increased million  from  million in to  million in policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income increased million driven by higher average variable annuity account values invested in separate accounts due to positive net flows and net transfers of balances from the general account to the separate accounts primarily driven by an automatic rebalancing element  also referred to as an asset transfer feature  in some of our optional living benefit features 
partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a decrease in net investment income of million  reflecting lower average annuity account values in the general account also resulting from transfers from the general account to the separate accounts 
premiums also decreased million  reflecting a decline in annuitizations of our variable annuity contracts

total account values for variable and fixed annuities amounted to billion as of december   representing an increase of billion from december  the increase was driven by positive variable annuity net flows  partially offset by decreases in the market value of customers variable annuities due to unfavorable equity markets and higher policy charges driven by the growing account value base 
gross sales of our variable annuities decreased billion  driven by the impacts of modifications we implemented in the first quarter of to scale back benefits and increase pricing  and increased competition as certain of our competitors became more aggressive in product design and pricing 
despite these impacts  we believe that our current product offerings remain competitively positioned and expect our living benefit features will provide us an attractive risk and profitability profile  as all of our currently sold optional living benefit features include an automatic rebalancing element 
our automatic rebalancing element occurs at the contractholder level  rather than at the fund level  which we believe enhances our risk management capabilities 
individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals were relatively flat despite the increase in account values  as the newly acquired business experienced lower lapse rates

total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to billion as of december   representing an increase of billion from december  the increase was driven by positive variable annuity net flows and increases in the market value of customers variable annuities due to favorable equity markets for individual variable annuity gross sales increased billion  from billion in to billion in the increase reflects our product strength  customer value proposition  and position as the primary provider of living benefit guarantees based on highest daily customer account value as well as the further expansion of our distribution networks 
additionally  we benefited from some of our competitors implementing product modifications to increase pricing and scale back product features due to market disruptions in late and the first half of individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals increased by billion  from billion in to billion in  reflecting the overall impact of higher account values in due to market appreciation during that period 
variable annuity net amount at risk the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder s current account balance 
changes in the global financial markets can create volatility in the net amounts at risk embedded in our variable annuity products that include optional living benefit and gmdb features 
as part of our risk management strategy  we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the risks associated with these products  primarily through a combination of product design elements  such as an automatic rebalancing element  and externally purchased hedging instruments 
our hedging program is discussed below in net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions 
the rate of return we realize from our variable annuity contracts can vary by contract based on our risk management strategy  including the impact of any capital market movements that we may hedge  the impact on that portion of our variable annuity contracts that benefit from the automatic rebalancing element  the impact of risks we have deemed suitable to retain and the impact of risks that are not able to be hedged 
the automatic rebalancing element  also referred to as an asset transfer feature  included in the design of certain optional living benefits  transfers assets between certain variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and  depending on the benefit feature  the fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate accounts 
the automatic rebalancing element associated with currently sold products transfers assets between certain variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and a designated bond portfolio within the separate accounts 
the transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the impact of investment performance on the contractholder s total account value 
in general  negative investment performance may result in transfers to either the fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate accounts  and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to contractholder selected variable investments 
overall  the automatic rebalancing element helps to mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility 
beginning in  all offerings of optional living benefit features associated with currently sold variable annuity products include an automatic rebalancing element  and in we discontinued any new sales of optional living benefit features without an automatic rebalancing element

table of contents net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as mentioned above  in addition to our automatic rebalancing element  we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs 
in our living benefit hedging program  we purchase interest rate swaps  swaptions  floors and caps as well as equity options and futures to hedge certain living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market assumptions such as interest rates  equity markets and market volatility 
prior to the third quarter of  our hedging strategy sought to generally match certain capital market sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap  excluding the impact of the market s perception of our own non performance risk npr  with capital market derivatives 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy as  in a low interest rate environment  we do not believe that the us gaap value of the embedded derivative liability is an appropriate measure for defining the hedge target 
our current hedge target definition is grounded in a us gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates two modifications to the us gaap valuation assumptions 
we add a credit spread to the us gaap risk free rate of return assumption used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk 
we also adjust our volatility assumption to remove certain risk margins embedded in the valuation technique used to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative liability under us gaap  as we believe the impact on the liability driven by these margins is temporary and does not reflect the economic value of the liability 
this hedging strategy results in differences each period between the change in the value of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap and the change in the value of the hedge positions  potentially increasing volatility in us gaap earnings 
in addition  we evaluate hedge levels versus our hedge target based on the overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing capital market conditions  and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition 
based on these considerations  beginning in the latter half of  we decided to temporarily hedge to an amount less than our hedge target definition to be consistent with our long term economic view 
from the inception of this decision through december   we have experienced cumulative increases in the hedge target liability of approximately billion related to the under hedged risk  with no corresponding hedge asset increase 
this cumulative impact includes billion of losses attributable to  partially offset by billion of gains attributable to because this decision is based on the overall capital considerations of the company as a whole  the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition is reported within corporate and other operations  as described in corporate and other 
as of december   the fair value of the living benefit embedded derivative under us gaap was a billion liability 
excluding the impact of the cumulative adjustment for npr of billion  the value of the living benefit embedded derivative was an billion liability 
as of december   the value of our hedge target  based on our hedge target definition  was a billion liability 
the difference between the value of the hedge target and the value of the living benefit embedded derivative under us gaap  excluding npr  as of december  is primarily attributable to the impact of the margins and return assumptions as discussed above 
as described above  our hedging strategy uses capital markets instruments to generally match certain capital market sensitivities of the portion of the hedge target liability we choose to hedge 
as of december   the fair value of our hedge positions was a net asset position of billion 
due to cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding hedge target  as well as our decision to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition and other factors  the amount of hedge assets compared to our hedge target measured as of any specific point in time will be different  and is not expected to be fully offsetting

as shown in the table above  the net impacts from changes in the embedded derivative liability and hedge positions  after the impact of dac and other costs  reported in the individual annuities segment were net benefits of  million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the net benefit of  million in included a net charge of  million resulting from the net impact of hedging  excluding the unhedged portions and assumption updates  driven by significant capital markets volatility in the second half of also included in the net benefit of  million was a net charge of million attributable to the difference between the valuation of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap and the valuation of the hedge target liability  which we choose not to hedge 
these charges were offset by a  million adjustment to the embedded derivative liability to reflect npr  primarily from a higher base of embedded derivative liabilities  driven by significant declines in risk free interest rates and the impact of account value performance  as well as an overall widening of the credit spreads used in valuing npr  which reflect the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 
partially offsetting these items was a net charge of  million from the inclusion of these items in current period gross profits used in calculating the amortization of dac 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we also determined that the cumulative difference between the change in the value of the hedge target liability  excluding the unhedged portions and assumption updates  and the change in the fair value of the hedge assets was other than temporary

capital hedge program in the second quarter of  we began the expansion of our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business  including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures 
these capital hedges  which primarily consisted of equity based total return swaps  were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products 
during the second quarter of  we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the individual annuities segment by terminating the equity based total return swaps  as part of a new program to more broadly address the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the company as a whole  under stress scenarios 
since the new program incorporates capital implications across a number of businesses  the results of that program are reported within corporate and other operations 
consequently  see corporate and other for a discussion of the results of the current program 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries for a further discussion of the capital hedge program 
the results of the individual annuities segment included million and million for and  respectively  of mark to market losses on these capital hedges prior to their termination  driven by favorable market conditions which resulted in an increase in our capital position 
the results of these hedges are included in realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments and have been excluded from adjusted operating income

adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in the increase primarily reflects higher asset based fee income  partially offset by lower net investment spread results and higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization 
also offsetting the increase in adjusted operating income is an unfavorable impact from annual reviews performed in the third quarter of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired  as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience 
higher asset based fee income was driven by an increase in fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business driven by net additions  and higher average full service fee based retirement account values primarily driven by market appreciation 
for further discussion of our sales and account values  see sales results and account values 
lower net investment spread results were driven by lower reinvestment rates  and the unfavorable impact of changes in the market values of alternative investments and equity investments in certain separate accounts 
partially offsetting these declines were the impact of lower crediting rates driven by rate resets in the first quarter of and higher general account stable value account values in our full service business 
the impact of higher structured settlement product balances in our institutional investment products business was essentially offset by lower balances from guaranteed investment product scheduled withdrawals 
higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  were driven by costs related to legal matters and strategic initiatives 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by a decline in charges related to certain cost reduction initiatives

the quarterly adjustments for current period experience had no net impact on earnings and resulted in an million benefit in  reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross profits and previously estimated expected gross profits 
together  these items resulted in a net charge of million in and a net charge of million in the net charge of million in was driven by changes to expense and net cash flow assumptions which decreased expected future gross profits  while the net charge of million in was driven by changes in lapse rate and fee based profit margin assumptions which also decreased expected future gross profits 
to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million  from million in to million in  primarily reflecting higher asset based fee income and improved net investment spread results partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  and a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements 
higher asset based fees were driven by an increase in average full service fee based retirement account values due to market appreciation and net additions  and higher fee based investment only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business driven by net additions 
improved net investment spread results were driven by lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business and increased income from alternative investments 
lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business resulted from rate resets in the third quarter of and first quarter of also contributing to the increase in net investment spread results were increased net settlements on floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio 
the increase in net swap settlements resulted from the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on the swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio primarily for our institutional investment products business 
partially offsetting the improvement in net investment spread results was the negative impact of a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled withdrawals from guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business partially offset by the positive impact of net additions in our structured settlement product and increases in balances in our full service general account stable value products 
partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was an increase in general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  driven by expenses incurred in related to certain cost reduction initiatives 
also partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements  primarily due to a benefit in related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business 
results for both and also include the impact of annual reviews of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired  as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience 
adjusted operating income for and included charges of million and million  respectively  from the annual reviews 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience resulted in an million benefit in compared to a million charge in  reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period 
together  these items resulted in net charges included in adjusted operating income of million for and million in the net charge of million in was driven by changes in lapse rate and fee based profit margin assumptions which both decreased expected future gross profits 
revenues to annual comparison 
revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million  from  million in to  million in premiums decreased million  driven by lower life contingent structured settlement and single premium annuity sales  partially offset by higher sales of non participating group annuity separate accounts 
the decrease in premiums resulted in a corresponding decrease in policyholders benefits  including the change in policy reserves  as discussed below 
net investment income decreased million primarily reflecting lower portfolio yields and the unfavorable

partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in net investment income  primarily reflecting a smaller base of invested assets resulting from scheduled withdrawals of our general account guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business  and lower portfolio yields  including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in net investment income from an increase in income on equity method alternative investments as discussed above

this increase in amortization largely reflects the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods 
the decrease in adjusted operating income also reflects the decline in earnings from our variable products primarily due to the runoff of variable policies in force 
these decreases to adjusted operating income were partially offset by higher net investment spread income driven by higher asset balances supporting growth in our universal life insurance products  as well as the impact from mortality experience  net of reinsurance  which was million less unfavorable relative to expected levels  compared to the changes in our estimates of total gross profits arising from separate account fund performance  as discussed above  reflects the impact on our estimates of total gross profits of the difference between our actual quarterly rate of return on separate accounts compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return

international insurance division foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  particularly in japan  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our us dollar equivalent earnings or our equity in foreign subsidiaries 
we seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies  including the use of derivative contracts and through holding us dollar denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the operations of our international insurance division are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar equivalent earnings from period to period even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  and hold dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a 
table of contents portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams  thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the forward currency hedging program is primarily associated with our insurance operations in japan including star and edison net of expected integration related costs  as well as korea and taiwan 
in addition  our japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non yen denominated products which are supported by investments in corresponding currencies 
while these non yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically hedged  the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs  resulting in volatility in reported us gaap earnings 
for further information on the various hedging strategies used to mitigate the risks of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings  see impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings 
we also seek to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our us dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies 
in our japanese insurance subsidiaries  we hedge a portion of the estimated available economic capital of the business using a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated assets financed by the combination of us gaap equity and yen denominated liabilities 
we may also hedge using instruments held in our us domiciled entities  such as us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen 
we are evaluating the hedging strategy related to our japanese insurance subsidiaries to consider the japanese operations relative contribution to the company s overall return on equity which may result in a change in the amount of yen exposure we hedge 
in our taiwan insurance operation  the us gaap equity exposure is mitigated by holding a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated investments 
during and  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of our other foreign operations  excluding our japan and taiwan insurance operations  due to a variety of considerations including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from strengthening foreign currencies

the us dollar denominated investments that hedge the us gaap equity exposure in our japanese insurance operations pay a coupon  which is reflected within net investment income  and  therefore  included in adjusted operating income  which is generally higher than what a similar yen based investment would pay 

table of contents the incremental impact of this higher yield of our us dollar denominated investments  as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed below  will vary over time  and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments  as well as interest rate environments in the us and japan at the time of the investments

impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segment s non us dollar denominated earnings in certain countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment s us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings from the hedged currency in exchange for us dollars at specified exchange rates 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
in establishing the level of non us dollar denominated earnings that will be hedged through this program  we exclude the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as well as the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by us dollar denominated products and investments  both of which are discussed in greater detail below 
as a result of this intercompany arrangement  our international insurance segment results for reflect the impact of translating yen and korean won denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of yen per us dollar and korean won per us dollar 
results for will reflect the impact of translating yen and korean won denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of yen per us dollar and korean won per us dollar

the principal of these dual currency investments are yen denominated while the related

these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollar denominated interest income 
our japanese insurance operations  excluding star and edison  also hold yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for fixed amounts of us dollar interest payments at the yen us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
as of december  and  the notional amount of these investments was billion  or billion  and billion  or billion  respectively  based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired

however  our japanese insurance operations also offer products denominated in non local currencies  primarily comprised of us and australian dollar denominated products 
the non yen denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies  including a significant portion designated as available for sale  and other related non yen denominated net assets  including accrued investment income  to support these products 
these assets and liabilities are impacted by foreign currency exchange rate movements  as they are non yen denominated items on the books of yen based entities 
while these non yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically hedged  the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs  resulting in volatility in us gaap earnings 
for example  available for sale investments under us gaap are carried at fair value with changes in fair value except as described below for impairments  including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income loss  whereas the non yen denominated liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  and the related change in value is recorded in earnings within asset management fees and other income 
investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap  are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  with the related change in value recorded in earnings within asset management fees and other income 
due to this non economic volatility that is reflected in us gaap  the change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  or remeasurement  of these non yen denominated assets and related liabilities associated with these products is excluded from adjusted operating income and included in realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments 
for the years ended december  and  realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments includes net gains of million and million  respectively  reflecting the remeasurement of these non yen denominated insurance liabilities  which are presented in the table below  and the remeasurement of certain non yen denominated related assets  and were primarily driven by the strengthening of the yen against the us and australian dollar

table of contents available for sale investments under us gaap are carried at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value except as described below for impairments  including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements  recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
changes in the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations due to foreign currency exchange rate movements are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a foreign currency translation adjustment  and can serve as an offset to the unrealized changes in fair value of the available for sale investments 
for the portion of available for sale investments that support our japanese insurance operations us gaap equity  this offset creates a natural equity hedge 
if us dollar denominated investments  including available for sale investments  supporting the hedge are in excess of our us gaap equity  then there is no offsetting impact to equity 
in addition  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the us gaap equity of our japanese insurance operations is partially offset by foreign currency exchange related changes in designated yen denominated debt and other hedging instruments held in our us domiciled entities and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a foreign currency translation adjustment 
the investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  with the related change in value recorded within asset management fees and other income 
the remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these investments is excluded from adjusted operating income 
we also incorporate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the remaining us dollar denominated net asset position of our japanese insurance operations  which primarily relates to accrued investment income  as part of our overall application of the hedge strategy 
these us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  as they are non yen denominated items on the books of yen based entities  and the related change in value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
the remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these items is excluded from adjusted operating income 
for us dollar denominated investments recorded on the books of yen based entities  foreign currency exchange movements will impact their value 
to the extent the value of the yen strengthens as compared to the us dollar  the value of these us dollar denominated investments will decrease 
upon the ultimate sale or maturity of the us dollar denominated investments  any realized change in value related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the income statement and excluded from adjusted operating income 
similarly  changes in the foreign currency exchange rates that result in other than temporary impairments on these investments will be included in realized investment gains losses  net within the income statement and  as such  excluded from adjusted operating income

international insurance operating results the results of our international insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates  inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above 
to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment  where indicated below  we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to us dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented

table of contents on april   the company entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries that conduct its global commodities business and certain assets that are primarily used in connection with the global commodities business 
as a result  we have reflected the results of the global commodities business as discontinued operations for all periods presented

the total purchase price was  million  comprised of  million in cash and million in assumed third party debt  substantially all of which is expected to be repaid  over time  with excess capital of the acquired entities 
all acquired entities are japanese corporations and their businesses are in japan 
the addition of these operations increases our scale in the japanese insurance market and provides complementary distribution opportunities 
we also expect these businesses to provide attractive returns primarily driven from in force business and cost synergies 
star and edison s bank channel distribution will be transferred and integrated with the bank channel operations of prudential gibraltar 
the star and edison companies were merged into gibraltar life on january  we expect pre tax integration costs of approximately million to be incurred over a five year period 
we incurred million of integration costs during and expect to incur approximately million during after the integration is completed  we expect annual cost savings of approximately million  and expect to achieve approximately two thirds of the annual savings by the end of actual integration costs may exceed  and actual costs savings may fall short of  such expectations 
the gibraltar life operations  including the star and edison businesses  use a november fiscal year end for purposes of inclusion in the company s consolidated financial statements 
therefore  operating results presented in the table above includes results for gibraltar life for the twelve months ended november   and  and include earnings for the star and edison businesses from the february  acquisition date through november  acquisition of yamato life on may   our gibraltar life operations acquired yamato life  a japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in october gibraltar life served as the reorganization sponsor for yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired yamato by contributing million of capital to yamato 
concurrent with our acquisition  substantially all of yamato s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these surrender charges were in the first year and decline by each year thereafter

these favorable items were partially offset by transaction and integration costs of million in relating to the star and edison acquisition and million of charges associated with claims and expenses arising from the march earthquake and tsunami in japan 
excluding the effect of the items discussed above  adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations increased million  reflecting business growth  including expanding sales of protection products  and improved investment results  including a greater contribution from our fixed annuity products reflecting growth of that business and lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
the lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs associated with our fixed annuity products was primarily driven by lower amortization rates reflecting an increase in prior period investment results included in total gross profits used as a basis for determining amortization rates 
partially offsetting these favorable variances were higher development costs supporting bank and agency distribution channel growth and unfavorable results from our insurance joint venture in india and our asset management related joint venture in china

in some of the markets in which we operate  it is difficult to find appropriate long duration assets to match the characteristics of our long duration product liabilities 
in japan  we have historically sought to increase the duration of our japanese yen investment portfolio by employing various strategies  including investing in longer term securities or by entering into long duration floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
these strategies better support the characteristics of our long dated product liabilities and have resulted in higher portfolio yields 
based on an evaluation of market conditions  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  we terminated or offset many of these interest rate swaps in consideration of  among other things  the interest rate environment 
the resulting realized investment gains from terminating or offsetting these interest rate swaps will be recognized in adjusted operating income over periods that generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives 
for  and  we recognized gains of million  million  and million  respectively  in adjusted operating income related to these realized investment gains losses 
as of december   million of deferred gains remain to be recognized in adjusted operating income over a weighted average period of years 
we continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities  and may implement these hedging strategies to lengthen the duration of our japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions dictates 
as we do so  the impact to our portfolio yields will depend on the interest rate environment at that time

sales results in managing our international insurance business  we analyze revenues  as well as annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap 
annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
annualized new business premiums include of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products 
no other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts 
the following table sets forth annualized new business premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions annualized new business premiums on an actual exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total on a constant exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total the year ended december  includes ten months of annualized new business premiums for the star and edison businesses  acquired february  with a diversified product mix supporting the growing demand for retirement and savings products  our international insurance operations offer various traditional whole life  term  endowment policies which provide for payment on the earlier of death or maturity and retirement income life insurance products that combine an insurance protection element similar to that of term life policies with a retirement income feature 
in most of our operations  we also offer certain health products with fixed benefits  some of which include a high savings element  as well as annuity products  which are primarily represented by us and australian dollar denominated fixed annuities in our gibraltar life operations 
our life planners primary objective is to sell protection oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and affluent customers  as well as to small businesses  whereas gibraltar s life advisors have primarily sold individual protection products to the broad middle income market in japan  particularly through relationships with affinity groups 
supplementing our core life planner and life advisor distribution channels  bank distribution channel sales primarily consist of products intended to provide premature death protection and retirement income  as well as fixed annuity products primarily denominated in us dollars  and increasingly  
table of contents australian dollars 
the addition of the star and edison businesses  with historical product offerings primarily comprised of individual life insurance  fixed annuities and certain health products with fixed benefits  significantly increases our scale in the japanese insurance marketplace and also provides complementary distribution capabilities through an increased captive agency force  expanded bank channel distribution  as well as the addition of an established independent agency channel 
historically  growth in annualized new business premiums was closely correlated to growth of our life planner and life advisor distribution force 
recently  growth in annualized new business premiums is being driven by increased average premium per new policy resulting in part from the growing demand for retirement oriented products  as well as expanded distribution through third party channels  especially banks 
as noted in the table below  bank channel sales contain a disproportionate number of single pay or limited pay contracts which tend to be larger policies and therefore have higher average premiums per policy 
our expectation is that this trend will continue

investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
authorities in some jurisdictions regulate interest rates guaranteed in our insurance contracts 
the regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on our underlying investments that support these products 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
with regulatory approval  guaranteed rates may be changed on new business which enhances our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns 
however  the major sources of profitability for many of our products  particularly those sold by prudential of japan  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables 
our mortality and morbidity experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended december   and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

corporate and other operations also recorded a million charge related to a voluntary contribution to an insurance industry insolvency fund  related to executive life insurance company of new york 
greater net charges from other corporate activities  primarily reflecting increased retained corporate expenses  including corporate advertising  contributed to the increased loss 
the increase in net charges from other corporate activities was partially offset by more favorable results from corporate foreign currency hedging activities and reduced charges compared to the prior period for certain retained obligations relating to pre demutualization policyholders to whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation 
capital debt interest expense increased million due to a greater level of capital debt  which includes the issuance in november of billion of debt for the acquisition of the star and edison businesses

results from corporate and other operations pension income and employee benefits decreased million primarily due to a decrease in income from our qualified pension plan 
income from our qualified pension plan decreased million  from million in to million in  due to a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets from in to in  partially offset by the effect on expected return due to the growth in plan assets 
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will decrease the discount rate to from in the expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to in from in  and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 
we determined our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors  we expect  on a consolidated basis  income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in  but at a level of about million to million lower than in other postretirement benefit expenses will increase in a range of million to million 
the increase is driven primarily by demographic updates  a decrease in the discount rate to from and the effect of a decrease in plan assets 
in  pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments 
to annual comparison 
the loss from corporate and other operations  on an adjusted operating income basis  increased million  from million in to million in capital debt interest expense increased million due to a greater level of capital debt  which includes the issuance in 
table of contents september of million of exchangeable surplus notes  and reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes beginning in the second quarter of  as well as the deployment of additional corporate borrowings for capital purposes 
investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense  decreased million 
net investment income  net of interest expense  excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase of substantially all of our convertible senior notes during also contributing to the greater loss from corporate operations in compared to the prior year are greater net charges from other corporate activities  primarily reflecting less favorable results from corporate hedging activities  increased corporate advertising expenses and other retained corporate expenses 
results from corporate and other operations pension income and employee benefits decreased million 
the decrease reflects increases in employee benefits costs partially offset by an increase in income from our qualified pension plan 
income from our qualified pension plan increased million  from million in to million in capital protection framework corporate and other operations includes the results of our capital protection framework  which includes  among other things  the capital hedge program 
the capital hedge program broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the company as a whole  under stress scenarios  as described under liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries 
this hedge program resulted in charges for amortization of derivative costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the market value changes of these derivatives included in realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments was a gain of million and a loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program  which is described under us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
we evaluate hedge levels versus our hedge target based on the overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing capital market conditions 
the gaap capital markets valuation framework underlying our hedge target assumes that current interest rate levels remain for the full projection period with no reversion to longer term averages 
due to the recent low interest rate environment  we decided to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition to be consistent with our long term economic view 
because this decision was based on the overall capital considerations of the company as a whole  the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition is reported within corporate and other operations 
for the years ended december  and  realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments includes a loss of  million and a gain of million  respectively  resulting from our decision to temporarily hedge to a different target and the change in interest rates during the years 
through our capital protection framework  we have access to on balance sheet capital and contingent sources of capital that is available to meet capital needs arising from our decision to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition  including funding of the after tax realized investment losses incurred in for more information on the company s capital protection framework  see liquidity and capital resources 
we assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis  and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the company s risk position or other factors 
results of operations of closed block business we established the closed block business effective as of the date of demutualization 
the closed block business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies 
we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies 
see overview closed block business for additional details 

table of contents each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block  including investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains  mortality experience and other factors 
although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million  which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies 
additionally  the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of  million at december   to be paid to closed block policyholders unless offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the closed block business 
consequently  results of the closed block business for all periods are presented only in accordance with us gaap

this expense was million higher than the policyholder dividend obligation expense of million in as noted above  as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  earnings volatility in the closed block business  which is primarily due to changes in investment results  may not be offset by changes in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation 
results also included a million increase in reserves for estimated payments arising from use of new social security master death file matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding this matter

experience rated contractholder liabilities  trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments are experience rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the 
table of contents majority of investments supporting these experience rated products are classified as trading and are carried at fair value 
these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value taasil 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in asset management fees and other income 
interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in net investment income 
to a lesser extent  these experience rated products are also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans 
the derivatives that support these experience rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as other long term investments and are carried at fair value  and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
the commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience rated products are carried at unpaid principal  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses  and are reflected on the statements of financial position as commercial mortgage and other loans 
gains and losses on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
our retirement segment has two types of experience rated products that are supported by taasil and other related investments 
fully participating products are those for which the entire return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability 
the adjustment to the liability is based on changes in the fair value of all of the related assets  including commercial mortgage and other loans  which are carried at amortized cost  less any valuation allowance 
partially participating products are those for which only a portion of the return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders over time through changes to the contractual crediting rates 
the crediting rates are typically reset semiannually  often subject to a minimum crediting rate  and returns are required to be passed back within ten years 
in our international insurance segment  the experience rated products are fully participating 
as a result  the entire return on the underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability 
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on taasil  related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans 
this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis 
in addition  to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments  adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans supporting these experience rated contracts  which are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances 
the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience rated contracts  and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments  both realized and unrealized  that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders 

table of contents the following tables set forth the impact of these items on results that are excluded from adjusted operating income for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions retirement segment investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net derivatives commercial mortgages and other loans change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses international insurance segment investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses total investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net derivatives commercial mortgages and other loans change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses decreases to contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities 
included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are increases of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as prescribed by us gaap  changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held for investment in our general account  other than when associated with impairments  are not recognized in income in the current period  while the impact of these changes in fair value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period 
as shown in the table above  the net impacts for the retirement segment of changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments were net losses of million and million and net gains of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these impacts primarily reflect timing differences between the recognition of the mark to market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products 
these impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of the underlying commercial mortgage and other loans and the amortized cost  less any valuation allowance  of these loans  as described above 
as shown in the table above  the international insurance segment includes offsetting impacts  in all periods  from changes in investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and experience rated contractholder liabilities 
valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value established a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within 
table of contents which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement

for additional information regarding the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value by hierarchy level see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the determination of fair value  which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions  can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as discussed in more detail below  the determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions  as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner 

table of contents for a description of the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections provide additional information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our financial services businesses and our closed block business which are valued using level inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding separate account assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is primarily borne by our customers and policyholders 
fixed maturity and equity securities public fixed maturity securities are generally valued using the price provided by independent pricing services under our normal pricing protocol 
securities with prices based on validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within level public fixed maturity securities included in level in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally developed valuations or non binding broker quotes 
for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities  the discounted cash flow or other valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs  and accordingly  such securities are included in level in our fair value hierarchy 
level fixed maturity securities included approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on non binding broker quotes  and approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of private fixed maturities  with the majority of values based on internally developed models 
significant unobservable inputs used included issue specific credit adjustments  material non public financial information  management judgment  estimation of future earnings and cash flows  default rate assumptions  liquidity assumptions and non binding quotes from market makers 
these inputs are usually considered unobservable  as not all market participants will have access to this data 
the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of equity 
our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
other long term investments the fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process 
the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model  following an income approach that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue  operating expenses and discount rates 
the appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value 
these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually  and incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data  including any market transactions 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation  the real estate investments within other long term investments have been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
consolidated real estate investment funds classified as level totaled approximately billion as of both december  and december  our direct investment in these funds is not material  and the majority of the assets recorded as a result of the consolidation of these funds are offset by a noncontrolling interest reflected as a separate component of equity 
the noncontrolling interest is not considered to be fair valued and therefore is not included in fair value reporting above 
the fair value of fund investments  where the fair value option has been elected  is primarily determined by the fund managers 
since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the company  these investments have also been included within level in our fair value hierarchy 
investments in these funds included in level totaled approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  derivative instruments derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets  within other trading account assets  or other long term investments  or as liabilities  within other liabilities  except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract 
the fair values of derivative contracts are determined based on quoted 
table of contents prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models  and are affected by changes in market factors including non performance risk 
the majority of our derivative positions are traded in the over the counter otc derivative market and are classified within level in our fair value hierarchy since their significant inputs have bid and ask prices that are actively quoted or can be readily obtained from external market data providers 
our policy is to use mid market pricing consistent with our best estimate of fair value 
derivatives classified as level include first to default credit basket swaps  look back equity options and other structured products 
these derivatives are valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets 
derivatives classified within level are validated through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker dealer values 
the fair values of otc derivative assets and liabilities classified as level totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  and million and million  respectively  as of december   without giving consideration to the impact of netting 
for additional information regarding embedded derivatives in our annuity and retirement products classified as level  see variable annuity optional living benefit features below 
all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivatives  with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations  are recorded in current earnings 
generally  the changes in fair value of non dealer related derivatives  excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in realized investment gains losses  net

variable annuity optional living benefit features our liability for future policy benefits includes general account liabilities for guarantees on variable annuity contracts  including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits gmiwb 
while these guarantees primarily relate to the optional living benefit features of our individual annuities segment  they are also included in certain variable annuities in our international insurance segment and certain retirement account based group variable annuities in our retirement segment 
these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in realized investment gains losses  net 
the fair values of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
this methodology could result in either a liability or contra liability balance  given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions 
since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations  the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques 
because there are significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features that are primarily unobservable  the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within level in our fair value hierarchy 
we are also required to incorporate the market perceived risk of our own non performance npr in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features 
since insurance liabilities are senior to debt  we believe that reflecting the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries in the valuation of the liability appropriately takes into consideration our npr 
to reflect the npr  we incorporate an additional credit spread over libor rates into the discount rate used in the valuations of the embedded derivative liability 
the additional credit spread over libor rates incorporated into the discount rate as of december  generally ranged from to basis points for the portion of the interest rate curve most relevant to these liabilities 
this additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to those individual living benefit contracts in a liability position and not to those in a contra liability position 
we also adjust these spreads to remove any illiquidity risk premium  subject to a floor based on a percentage of the credit spread 

table of contents as of december   the value of the embedded derivatives associated with the optional living benefit features of the individual annuities segment  before the adjustment for npr  was a net liability of  million 
this net liability was comprised of  million of individual living benefit contracts in a liability position  net of million of individual living benefit contracts in a contra liability position 
as of december   our adjustment for npr resulted in a  million cumulative decrease to the embedded derivative liability for the individual annuities segment  reflecting the additional credit spread over libor rates we incorporated into the discount rate used in the valuations of those individual living benefit contracts in a liability position 
this adjustment for npr represents an increase of  million in for the individual annuities segment primarily resulting from a higher base of embedded derivative liabilities  driven by significant declines in risk free interest rates and the impact of account value performance  as well as an overall widening of the spreads used in valuing npr  which reflect the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 
partially offsetting these items was a million charge relating to a refinement to the calculation of the npr that we implemented in the fourth quarter of  which incorporates a floor to the illiquidity risk premium reduction at a percentage of the credit spread 
the change in fair value of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb resulted in a net liability of  million as of december   compared to a net contra liability of million as of december  the change primarily reflects a higher base of embedded derivative liabilities driven by significant declines in risk free interest rates and the impact of account value performance  as well as an overall widening of the spreads used in valuing npr  as noted above  which were primarily in our individual annuities segment as described in more detail under results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
realized investment gains and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the sale of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments  as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments

for a further discussion of our policy regarding commercial mortgage and other loans  see general account investments commercial mortgage and other loans commercial mortgage and other loan quality below 
the level of other than temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
historically  the causes of other than temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region 
as discussed in more detail below  certain of the other than temporary impairments recognized for the year ended december  related to foreign currency translation losses on securities that are approaching maturity  as well as adverse financial conditions of the respective issuer on asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages and japanese commercial mortgage backed securities 
other than temporary impairments recognized for the year ended december  were primarily related to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime 
table of contents mortgages and japanese commercial mortgage backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  foreign currency translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity  and the intent to sell securities  primarily related to asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
we may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
other than temporary impairments  interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors are excluded from adjusted operating income 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment 
we use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
we also use equity based and interest rate derivatives to hedge the risks embedded in some of our annuity products 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains losses  net  subject to certain exceptions realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments  and related charges and adjustments

our japanese insurance operations hold foreign currency denominated investments which in some cases  due primarily to the strengthening of the yen  are currently in an unrealized loss position 
as they approach maturity and remain in an unrealized loss position  it becomes less likely that the exchange rates will recover and more likely that losses will be realized upon maturity and therefore we record an other than temporary impairment

fixed maturity other than temporary impairments in were concentrated in asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  japanese commercial mortgage backed securities  and the services  manufacturing  and finance sectors of our corporate securities 
these other than temporary impairments were primarily driven by asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  the impact of the rising forward libor curve and the intent to sell securities 
additionally  other than temporary impairments were driven by japanese commercial mortgage backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  and foreign currency translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity 
our japanese insurance operations hold us dollar denominated investments which in some cases  due primarily to the strengthening of the yen  are currently in an unrealized loss position

general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our trading and banking operations  assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints over time  and for certain portfolios  maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of their major products 
our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the financial services businesses over time include the investment of proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  and operating cash flows  into investments with competitive yields  and where appropriate  the sale of the portfolio s lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s duration  credit  currency and other risk constraints  all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and maximizing total return  including both investment yield and capital gains  and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 
while we continue to look to maximize book yield and match the liability characteristics of our major products  our portfolio management approach also reflects a consideration of the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity  our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery  and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery 
in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions  beginning in the fourth quarter of we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy previously employed in the closed block business and certain portfolios of the financial services businesses 
starting in the second quarter of  we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios  and continue to evaluate trading strategies for these portfolios 
for a further discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments  including our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery  see fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities and equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities  below 

table of contents management of investments we design asset mix strategies and derivative strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management  strategic and tactical asset allocations and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework 
derivative strategies are employed within our risk management framework to help manage duration gaps  currency  and other risks between assets and liabilities 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments  and other than trading activities insurance and annuity products asset liability management 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the asset management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those managed by our international insurance segment  under the direction and oversight of the asset liability management and risk management groups 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally  within enterprise risk constraints  in most cases using our international and domestic asset management capabilities 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions periodically 
our portfolio management groups work with our risk management group to develop the investment policies for the general account assets of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries  oversee the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the portfolio management groups  which are integrated within our businesses  work closely with risk management to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes and to develop investment objectives  including performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as traditional whole life and endowment products  guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment 
the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor

asset backed securities included within asset backed securities attributable to the financial services businesses are securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
while there is no market standard definition  we define sub prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores  as well as mortgages with higher loan to value ratios  or limited documentation 
the significant deterioration of the us housing market  high interest rate resets  higher unemployment levels  and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub prime mortgages have led to higher delinquency rates  particularly for those mortgages issued in and recently there has been significant attention given to potential deficiencies in lenders foreclosure documentation  causing delays in the foreclosure process 
many lenders have indicated that the issues are administrative and they do not expect significant delays in their foreclosure proceedings 
from the perspective of an investor in securities backed by sub prime collateral  any significant delays in foreclosure proceedings could result in increased servicing costs which could negatively affect the value of the impacted securities 
separately  as an investor in sub prime securities  we are evaluating our legal options with respect to potential remedies arising from any potential deficiencies related to the original lending and securitization practices

commercial mortgage backed securities the commercial real estate market was severely impacted by the financial crisis and the subsequent recession 
however  market fundamentals appear to have bottomed and are showing signs of improvement since late commercial real estate vacancy rates have declined from their peak  rent growth has turned positive for certain sectors  and prices of commercial real estate appear to be stabilizing and improving in some sectors 
additionally  the elevated delinquency rate on mortgages in the commercial mortgage backed securities market is slowing and refinancing activity has increased  at least partially reflecting the improvement in these fundamentals 
the loans included in new issues seem to reflect better underwriting and lower levels of leverage compared to although there are some positive signs in commercial real estate  there are still some significant challenges for this market  including numerous future loan workouts  a large wave of refinancings for over leveraged properties and numerous legislative changes

the super senior structure was introduced to the us commercial mortgage backed securities market in late and was modified in early to increase subordination from to 
with the changes to the commercial mortgage backed securities structure in  there became three distinct aaa classes for commercial mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms  super senior aaa with subordination  mezzanine aaa with subordination and junior aaa with approximately subordination 
the super senior class has priority over the mezzanine and junior classes to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments and recoveries on defaulted loans 
as a result  all super senior bonds must be completely repaid before the mezzanine or junior bonds receive any principal cash flows 
in addition  the super senior bonds will not experience any loss of principal until both the entire mezzanine and junior bonds are written down to zero 
we believe the importance of this additional credit enhancement afforded to the super senior class over the mezzanine and junior classes is limited in a benign commercial real estate cycle with low defaults but becomes more significant in a deep commercial real estate downturn under which expected losses increase substantially 
in addition to enhanced subordination  certain securities within the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows 
the super senior class is generally structured such that shorter duration time tranches have priority over longer duration time tranches as to all principal cash flows repayments  prepayments  and recoveries on defaulted loans until the deal reaches cumulative net loss  at which point all super senior securities are paid pro rata 
as a result  short of reaching cumulative net losses  the shorter duration super senior tranches must be completely repaid before the longest duration super senior tranche receives any principal cash flows 
we have generally focused our purchases of recent vintage commercial mortgage backed securities on shorter duration super senior tranches that we believe have sufficient priority to ensure that in most scenarios our positions will be fully repaid prior to the structure reaching the cumulative net loss threshold

naic designations of through generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade  which include securities rated ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by standard poor s 
however  in the fourth quarter of the naic adopted rules which changed the methodology for determining the naic designations for non agency residential mortgage backed securities  including our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
under these rules  rather than being based on the rating of a third party rating agency  as of december  the naic designations for such securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party engaged by the naic and the statutory carrying value of the security  including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized 
the modeled results used in determining naic designations as of december  were updated and utilized for reporting as of december  in the fourth quarter of  the naic adopted rules which changed the methodology for determining the naic designations for commercial mortgage backed securities  similar to what was done in the fourth quarter of for residential mortgage backed securities 
both methodologies remained unchanged and were utilized for december  as a result of time lags between the funding of investments  the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the svo filing process  the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the svo as of each balance sheet date

see other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 

table of contents other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
for private placements  our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer  and the extent and duration of the decline 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we place greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value 
our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment 
we continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases 
in addition  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when a we have the intent to sell the debt security  or b it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or c a foreign currency denominated security with a foreign currency translation loss approaches maturity 
for all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet any of these criteria  we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security 
if the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment  an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
the determination of the assumptions used in these projections requires the use of significant management judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other than temporary impairments for debt securities

we originate commercial and agricultural mortgage loans using a dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices 
all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending 
uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance 
residential property loans primarily include japanese recourse loans 
upon default of these recourse loans we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner  in addition to the mortgaged property 
these loans are also backed by third party guarantors

composition of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans the commercial real estate market was severely impacted by the financial crisis and the subsequent recession  though the flow of capital to commercial real estate has been strong since portfolio lenders are actively originating loans on the highest quality properties in primary markets  resulting in an increase in the liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market 
for certain property types  the market fundamentals are stabilizing to slightly improving  while other property types have farther to go in this recovery 
in addition  the commercial banks are active and there has been new loan origination activity by securitization lenders 
these conditions have led to greater competition for portfolio lenders such as our general 
table of contents account  though underwriting remains conservative 
while there is still weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals that are dependent on employment recovery  delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans remain relatively stable

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a smaller loan to value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service 
table of contents coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments 
a larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments 
as of december   our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the financial services businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of times  and a weighted average loan to value ratio of

the values utilized in calculating these loan to value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio  which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value 
our periodic review also includes a quality re rating process  whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above 
as discussed below  the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for loan losses 
for loans with collateral under construction  renovation or lease up  a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan to value and debt service coverage ratios 
our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the financial services businesses included approximately billion of such loans as of december  and billion of such loans as of december   and our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the closed block business included approximately billion of such loans as of december  and all else being equal  these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized 
as of december   there are no loan specific reserves related to these loans attributable to either the financial services businesses or the closed block business

we place loans on early warning status in cases where  based on our analysis of the loan s collateral  the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors  we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur 
we classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
as described below  in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans 
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process 
the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be impaired as a result of our loan review process  and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list 
we define an impaired loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for an impaired loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above 
the portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience  including historical credit migration  loss probability  and loss severity factors by property type 
these factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate 
the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors

see other than temporary impairments of equity securities for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations 
other than temporary impairments of equity securities for those equity securities classified as available for sale  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value 
all securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value maintained for one year or greater  and declines in value greater than  the reasons for the decline in value issuer specific event  currency or market fluctuation  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 

table of contents we generally recognize other than temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater 
in addition  in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including an assessment of the issuer s capital position  and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary  we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery

examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
for perpetual preferred securities  which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities  we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities  factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and the lack of a formal maturity date

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company 
capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses  fund business growth  and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances 
our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses  general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein 
management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi year time horizon through our quarterly planning process 
we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds presently available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries  including reasonably foreseeable contingencies 

table of contents we continue to refine our metrics for capital management 
these refinements to the current framework  which is primarily based on statutory risk based capital measures  are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company 
in addition  we continue to use an economic capital framework for making certain business decisions 
similar to our planning and management process for liquidity  we ensure the availability of adequate capital under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios using our capital protection framework 
we use our capital protection framework to assess potential capital needs arising from severe market related distress and sources of capital available to us to meet those needs 
potential sources include on balance sheet capital  derivatives and other contingent sources of capital 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  signed into law on july   could result in the imposition of new capital  liquidity and other requirements on prudential financial and its subsidiaries

the timing and amount of any additional share repurchases will be determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations 
repurchases may be effected in the open market  through derivative  accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule b c under the exchange act 
numerous factors could affect the timing and amount of any future repurchases under the share repurchase program  including increased capital needs of our businesses due to opportunities for growth and acquisitions  as well as adverse market conditions

capital debt consists of borrowings that are used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of prudential financial  as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of prudential financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements 
as shown in the table below  as of december   the financial services businesses had billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations

as of december   our capital debt to total capital ratio was 
the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt have certain features that result in their treatment as hybrid securities by the rating agencies

restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends as described below  all dividends or other distributions paid by prudential insurance may be paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets as of the prior calendar year end 
as of december  and  prudential insurance s unassigned surplus was  million and  million  respectively  and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of  million and  million  respectively 
prudential insurance must give prior notification to the new jersey department of banking and insurance  or njdobi  or the department  of its intent to pay any dividend or distribution 
also  if any dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus or ii the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses  the dividend is considered to be an extraordinary dividend and the prior approval of the department is required for payment of the dividend 
prudential insurance s statutory surplus as of december  was  million and its statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  for the year ended december  was million 
in addition to the regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances

table of contents as a result of gibraltar life s reorganization in  in addition to regulatory requirements  certain other restrictions precluded gibraltar life from paying common stock dividends to prudential financial 
we anticipate that following the merger of gibraltar  star and edison  the merged entity will be able to pay common stock dividends to prudential financial  subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
however  we do not anticipate receiving dividends from the merged entity for several years as it may return capital to prudential financial through other means  such as the repayment of subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by prudential financial or other affiliates 
in august  gibraltar life repaid billion  or million  of subordinated debt held by an intermediate holding company  of which million was used to repay a loan from prudential insurance and the remainder was paid to prudential financial 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint but can be affected by market conditions and other factors 
see liquidity and capital resources of our subsidiaries below for additional details on the liquidity of our domestic insurance subsidiaries  international insurance subsidiaries and asset management subsidiaries 
alternative sources of liquidity prudential financial maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between prudential financial and its affiliates on a daily basis 
depending on the overall availability of cash  prudential financial invests excess cash on a short term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets 
additional longer term liquidity is available through inter affiliate borrowing arrangements 
prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities  as discussed under credit facilities  as well as the alternative sources of liquidity described below 
commercial paper programs prudential financial and prudential funding  llc  or prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  have commercial paper programs with an authorized issuance capacity of billion and billion  respectively 
prudential financial commercial paper borrowings generally have been used to fund the working capital needs of our subsidiaries 
prudential funding commercial paper borrowings have generally served as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of prudential insurance and its subsidiaries 
prudential funding also lends to other subsidiaries of prudential financial up to limits agreed with the njdobi 
while we continue to consider commercial paper one of our alternative sources of liquidity due to the low cost and efficient financing it provides  over the past several years we have significantly reduced our reliance on commercial paper to fund our operations  and have developed plans that would enable us to further reduce  or if necessary eliminate  our commercial paper borrowings by accessing other sources of liquidity

these facilities can be used as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs or for other general corporate purposes 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
for a further description of these lines of credit  see credit facilities 
asset based financing we conduct asset based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries  including transactions such as securities lending  repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls  in order to earn spread income  to borrow funds  or to facilitate trading activity 
these programs are driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace 
the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short term spread portfolios of our domestic insurance entities 
investments held in the short term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and fixed maturities  including mortgage and asset backed securities  with a weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less 
a portion of the asset backed securities held in our short term spread portfolios  including our enhanced short term portfolio  are collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short term spread portfolio 
see realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities for a further discussion of our asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime holdings  including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short term portfolio 
these short term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements  which among other things  do not allow for significant asset liability interest rate duration mismatch 
the following table sets forth our liabilities under asset based or secured financing programs attributable to the financial services businesses and closed block business as of the dates indicated

excludes securities that may be returned to the company overnight 
in addition  as of december   our closed block business had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls under which we are committed to repurchase million of mortgage backed securities  or to be announced tba forward contracts 
these repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives 
these mortgage backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
as of december   our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the securities lending program of billion  of which billion were on loan 
taking into account market conditions and 
table of contents outstanding loan balances as of december   we believe approximately billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable  of which approximately billion relates to the financial services businesses  however  these amounts are subject to potential regulatory constraints and to changes in market conditions 
as referenced above  these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates 
as such  we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs 
holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available financing 
current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds  investment spreads  asset liability duration matching and liquidity 
federal home loan bank of new york prudential insurance is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny 
membership allows prudential insurance access to the fhlbny s financial services  including the ability to obtain collateralized loans and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity 
fhlbny borrowings and funding agreements are collateralized by qualifying mortgage related assets or us treasury securities  the fair value of which must be maintained at certain specified levels relative to outstanding borrowings  depending on the type of asset pledged 
fhlbny membership requires prudential insurance to own member stock  and borrowings require the purchase of activity based stock in an amount equal to of outstanding borrowings 
under fhlbny guidelines  if prudential insurance s financial strength ratings decline below a a a stable by s p moody s fitch  respectively  and the fhlbny does not receive written assurances from njdobi regarding prudential insurance s solvency  new borrowings from the fhlbny would be limited to a term of days or less 
currently there are no restrictions on the term of borrowings from the fhlbny 
njdobi permits prudential insurance to pledge collateral to the fhlbny in an amount of up to of its prior year end statutory net admitted assets  excluding separate account assets 
based on prudential insurance s statutory net admitted assets as of december   the limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity after taking into account required collateralization levels and purchases of activity based stock of approximately billion 
nevertheless  fhlbny borrowings are subject to the fhlbny s discretion and to the availability of qualifying assets at prudential insurance 
as of december   we had pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of billion  which supported outstanding collateralized advances of billion and collateralized funding agreements of billion 
the fair value of qualifying assets that were available to prudential insurance but not pledged amounted to billion as of december  as of december   million of the fhlbny outstanding advances is reflected in short term debt and matures in december and the remaining million is in long term debt and matures in december as of december   million of these proceeds were used to support the operating needs of our businesses and million were used to purchase investments  including the fhlbny activity based stock 
the funding agreements issued to the fhlbny  which are reflected in policyholders account balances  have priority claim status above debt holders of prudential insurance 
these funding agreements currently serve as a substitute funding source for a product of our retirement segment  which earns investment spread that was previously funded by retail medium term notes issued by prudential financial 
federal home loan bank of boston prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  or priac  is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston  or fhlbb 
membership allows priac access to collateralized advances which will be classified in short term debt or long term debt  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
priac s membership in fhlbb requires the ownership of member stock  and borrowings from fhlbb require the 
table of contents purchase of activity based stock in an amount between and of outstanding borrowings  depending on the maturity date of the obligation 
as of december   priac had no advances outstanding under the fhlbb facility 
the connecticut department of insurance  or ctdoi  permits priac to pledge up to billion in qualifying assets to secure fhlbb borrowings through december  priac must seek re approval from ctdoi prior to borrowing additional funds after that date 
based on available eligible assets as of december   priac had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity  after taking into consideration required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity based fhlbb stock  of approximately billion 
liquidity and capital resources of our subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
the impact of prudential funding s financing capacity on liquidity  as discussed more fully under alternative sources of liquidity  is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support 
the results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and certain annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations  as well as internal and external borrowings 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and payments in connection with financing activities 
we believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels  policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  and the relative safety of competing products  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
in addition  market volatility can impact the level of capital required to support our businesses  particularly in our annuity business 
our domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  commitments to invest and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these 
table of contents contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates  due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of market declines in recent years 
annuity benefits and guaranteed investment withdrawals under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities 
as of december  and  our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of billion and billion  respectively  which includes a portion financed with asset based financing 
the portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
the remaining billion  or  of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
our domestic insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations 
for a further discussion of realized investment gains and losses  see realized investment gains 
table of contents and losses and general account investments realized investment gains and losses 
we believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies 
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
instead of selling investments at depressed market prices externally  in order to preserve economic value including tax attributes  we may also sell investments from one subsidiary to another at fair market value or transfer investments internally between businesses within the same subsidiary  subject to applicable regulatory constraints 
capital the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries rbc ratios to a level consistent with their ratings targets 
rbc is determined by statutory guidelines and formulas that consider  among other things  risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capitalization 
as of december   the rbc ratio for prudential insurance was approximately  which exceeded the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations 
in addition  all of our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries have rbc ratios that exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations 
the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing  advertising or promotional activities 
the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations  changes in the values of derivatives  the level of impairments recorded and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio  among other items 
further  the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by  or credit quality migration affecting  the reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels 
the level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance subsidiaries is also affected by statutory accounting rules  which are subject to change by insurance regulators 
during  as part of our capital protection framework  we developed a broad view of the impact of market distress on the statutory capital of the company 
beginning in the second quarter of  we have entered into equity index linked derivative transactions that are designed to mitigate the impact of a severe equity market stress event on statutory capital 
the program focuses on tail risk to protect our capital in a cost effective manner under stress scenarios 
we assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis  and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the company s risk position or other factors 
in addition to hedging equity market exposure  we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs 
in our living benefits hedging program  we purchase interest rate derivatives and equity options and futures to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market assumptions such as interest rates  equity markets and market volatility 
prior to the third quarter of  our hedging strategy sought to generally match certain capital market sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  with capital market derivatives 
in the third quarter of  we revised our hedging strategy as  in a low interest rate environment  we do not believe that the us gaap value of the embedded derivative liability is an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target 
our new hedge target is grounded in a us gaap capital markets valuation framework but incorporates two modifications to the us gaap valuation assumptions 
we add a credit spread to the us gaap risk free rate of return assumption used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds  which support these living benefits  are invested in assets that contain risk 
we also adjust our volatility assumptions to remove certain risk margins embedded in the valuation technique used to fair value the embedded derivative liability under us gaap  as we believe the increase in the liability driven by these margins is temporary and does not reflect the economic 
table of contents value of the liability 
we evaluate hedge levels versus our hedge target based on the overall capital considerations of the company and prevailing market conditions 
the us gaap capital markets valuation framework underlying our hedge target assumes that current interest rate levels remain unchanged for the full projection period with no reversion to longer term averages 
due to the recent low interest rate environment  we decided to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition to be consistent with our long term economic view 
because the hedging decision was based on the overall capital considerations of the company  the corresponding impact on results is reported within corporate and other operations 
for the years ended december  and  realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments within corporate and other operations includes a pre tax loss of  million and a pre tax gain of million  respectively  resulting from our decision to temporarily hedge to a different target and the decline in interest rates during the year 
through our capital protection framework  we have access to on balance sheet capital and contingent sources of capital that is available to meet capital needs arising from activities such as the after tax realized investment losses incurred in from our living benefits hedging program  including our decision to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition 
for a full discussion of the results of our living benefits hedging program  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
we reinsure variable annuity living benefit guarantees from certain of our life insurance companies to a captive reinsurance company  pruco reinsurance  ltd 
pruco re 
the variable annuity living benefit hedging program described above is primarily executed within pruco re 
effective as of july   pruco re re domiciled from bermuda to arizona 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  our arizona domiciled life insurance company  pruco life insurance company  is able to claim reinsurance reserve credit for business ceded to pruco re without any need for pruco re to collateralize its obligations under the reinsurance arrangement 
however  for business ceded to pruco re by prudential annuities life assurance corporation palac and pruco life insurance company of new jersey plnj  we must continue to collateralize pruco re s obligations under the reinsurance arrangement in order for palac and plnj to claim reinsurance reserve credit for their business ceded 
we satisfy this requirement by depositing assets into statutory reserve credit trusts for pruco re 
funding needs for the statutory reserve credit trusts are separate and distinct from the capital needs of the captive reinsurance company 
however  assets pledged to the statutory reserve credit trusts may include assets supporting the capital of the captive reinsurance company provided that they meet eligibility requirements prescribed by the relevant insurance regulators 
reinsurance credit reserve requirements can move materially in either direction due to changes in equity markets and interest rates  actuarial assumptions and other factors 
higher reinsurance credit reserve requirements would necessitate depositing additional assets in the statutory reserve credit trusts  while lower reinsurance credit reserve requirements would allow assets to be removed from the statutory reserve credit trusts 
lower interest rates in led to an increase in our need to fund the captive reinsurance trusts by an amount of million for the year ended december   primarily relating to business sold by palac and plnj 
we satisfied the overall increase in funding requirements in with available cash and by re hypothecating assets into the trust that were otherwise pledged by our affiliates under hedging positions related to our living benefit features 
in october  we established a new reinsurance arrangement with our captive reinsurance company domiciled in new jersey  whereby the new jersey captive reinsures of the short term risks under the policies in prudential insurance s closed block 
these short term risks represent the impact of variations in experience of the closed block that are expected to be recovered over time as a result of corresponding adjustments to policyholder dividends 
the new reinsurance arrangement is intended to alleviate the short term surplus volatility within prudential insurance resulting from the closed block  including volatility caused by the impact of any unrealized mark to market losses or realized credit losses within the investment portfolio of the closed block 
in connection with the new closed block reinsurance arrangement  we entered into a billion letter of credit facility with certain financial institutions  pursuant to which the new jersey captive can obtain a letter of credit during a year availability period to support its funding obligations under the reinsurance arrangement 
prudential financial guarantees all obligations of the new jersey captive under the facility  including its obligation to reimburse any draws made under the letter of credit 
because experience of the closed block is ultimately 
table of contents passed along to policyholders over time through the annual policyholder dividend  we believe that any draw under the letter of credit is unlikely 
our ability to obtain a letter of credit under the facility is subject to the continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including the maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law and prudential financial s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least billion  based on us gaap stockholders equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
international insurance and investments subsidiaries on february   we completed our acquisition of the star and edison businesses 
gibraltar life and prudential of japan each contributed million to payment of the acquisition purchase price  with the remaining funding provided by prudential financial and other subsidiaries 
although these contributions reduced local solvency margin ratios in gibraltar and prudential of japan  the solvency margins for these companies remain in excess of our targets 
the contributions did not materially impact gibraltar life s or prudential of japan s liquidity as their investment portfolios were positioned to provide the funding 
star and edison solvency margin ratios at acquisition were in excess of our solvency margin targets and will continue to be managed to capitalization levels consistent with our aa ratings targets 
we believe the liquidity profiles of star and edison are sufficient to meet their obligations  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
since completing the acquisition  we have further enhanced the capital profile of star and edison by repositioning their asset portfolios to reduce risk and establish an asset profile similar to gibraltar s 
we substantially completed this repositioning by year end effective january   the star and edison entities merged with gibraltar life 
we believe the solvency margin ratio of the merged entity will continue to be in excess of our solvency margin targets 
in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through operating cash flows from ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity and the interest rate and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries 
we monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures  taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 
we also consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations liquidity under stress scenarios 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the following table sets forth our international insurance subsidiaries portfolio of liquid assets  including cash and short term investments  and fixed maturity investments  other than those designated as held to maturity  by naic or equivalent rating as of the dates indicated 
december  prudential of japan gibraltar life star and edison businesses all other total december  in billions cash and short term investments fixed maturity investments high or highest quality other than high or highest quality subtotal total represents our international insurance operations  excluding japan 
of the billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity and considered high or highest quality as of december   billion  or  were invested in government or government agency bonds 

table of contents as with our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of our international insurance subsidiaries  as of the dates indicated 
december  in billions prudential of japan gibraltar life star and edison businesses all other international insurance subsidiaries total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders as of december  and  billion and billion  respectively  of the insurance related liabilities for prudential of japan are associated with us dollar denominated products that are coinsured to our us domiciled insurance operations and supported by us dollar denominated assets 
represents our international insurance operations  excluding japan 
our japanese operations did not have a material amount of general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  and additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by our japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by us insurance regulators  regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies 
all of our international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities 
these solvency margins are also a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations 
we manage these solvency margins to a capitalization level consistent with our aa ratings target 
maintenance of our solvency ratios at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning  as in certain jurisdictions  such as japan  these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength 
the financial services agency  the insurance regulator in japan  has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company s core capital is calculated 
these changes will be effective for the fiscal year ending march  the following table depicts the solvency margins of our japanese insurance subsidiaries under the old method as of march  and and under the new method as of march  new method old method march  march  march  prudential of japan gibraltar life star  n a edison  n a we believe that the solvency margins of our japanese insurance subsidiaries  under the new method  will continue to satisfy regulatory and other requirements and will not negatively impact our competitive positioning 
the capital requirements in korea and taiwan are also undergoing change 
korean insurance regulators have refined their rbc calculation effective june with the most significant change related to the interest rate risk charge 
the rbc ratio for prudential of korea  or pok  will be lower under the new calculation reflective of the long duration of its liabilities and high policy persistency 
nevertheless  we expect that pok s rbc ratio under the new calculation will remain one of the highest in the industry and will continue to exceed a level consistent 
table of contents with our aa ratings target 
additionally  taiwanese regulators recently made slight refinements to their rbc calculation effective as of january the new calculation resulted in a modest increase in the interest rate risk charge and resulted in only a slight decline in prudential of taiwan s rbc ratio with no expected corresponding competitive impact 
on march   japan experienced a massive earthquake followed by a tsunami which caused extensive damage and loss of life 
we estimate that the impact of claims as a result of these events will not have a material impact on the capital and liquidity positions of our operating companies 
in addition  we have not experienced and do not expect a significant impact to the valuation of our investments or our ability to operate our japanese businesses as a result of these events 
we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements  including the strategies discussed in results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance division 
these hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs 
the internal hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities and serve to hedge the value of us dollar denominated investments held on the books of these yen based entities 
a portion of these us dollar denominated investments are part of our hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our us dollar equivalent investment in our japanese subsidiaries 
absent an internal hedge  the changes in market value of these us dollar denominated investments attributable to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate would create volatility in the solvency margins of these subsidiaries 
in order to minimize this volatility  we enter into inter company hedges 
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and these yen based subsidiaries 
the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial funded million of cash settlements related to the internal hedge program  which were paid to the yen based subsidiaries 
as of december   the market value of the internal hedges was a liability of  million owed to the yen based subsidiaries of prudential financial 
absent any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of december   the  million internal hedge liability represents the present value of the net cash flows from prudential financial to these entities over the life of the hedging instruments  up to years  and would require additional liquidity and capital to fund contributions from prudential financial to our subsidiaries 
a significant yen appreciation over an extended period of time  and in excess of the forward exchange rates  would result in higher capital and liquidity needs to fund the net cash outflows from prudential financial 
our external hedges primarily serve to hedge most of the foreign denominated future income of our foreign subsidiaries and the equity investments in certain of these subsidiaries 
the external hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and external parties 
cash settlements on these activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and the external parties and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial paid million of net cash flows for international insurance related external hedge settlements 
as of december   the net liability related to external foreign currency hedges was million 
a significant appreciation in yen and other foreign currencies could result in net cash outflows in excess of our liability 
during and  we terminated our hedges of the us gaap equity exposure of all of our other foreign operations  excluding our japan and taiwan insurance operations  due to a variety of considerations  including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would result from strengthening foreign currencies 
in our international investments operations  liquidity is provided through asset management fees as well as commission revenue 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distributions of dividends and returns of capital 
as with our domestic operations  the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe cash flows from our international investments subsidiaries are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures

asset management subsidiaries our asset management businesses  which include real estate  public and private fixed income and public equity asset management  as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing  and retail investment products  such as mutual funds and other retail services  are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions 
our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make  and the fee based asset management business can provide a relatively stable source of cash flow to prudential financial 
the principal sources of liquidity for our fee based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
the principal sources of liquidity for our strategic investments and interim loans held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments  the ability to liquidate investments  and available borrowing lines from internal sources  including prudential funding and prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner  declines in the value of assets and credit defaults 
in april  our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business received approval to participate in a fannie mae alternative delivery program known as asap plus as soon as pooled delivery 
our approval limit for outstanding balances on asap plus is presently million 
this program allows us to assign a qualified fannie mae loan trade commitment to fannie mae as early as the next business day after a loan closes  and receive of the loan purchase price from fannie mae 
the program does not eliminate the need to provide temporary warehouse financing  but does significantly reduce the duration of funding requirements for eligible fannie mae originated loans from the normal delivery cycle of two to four weeks down to as little as one to two days 
there was no balance outstanding on this program as of december  certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by prudential insurance 
in the normal course of business  prudential insurance  on behalf of these separate accounts  may contractually agree to various funding commitments which may include  among other things  commitments to purchase real estate  to invest in real estate partnerships both existing and to be formed to acquire or develop real estate  and or to fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously acquired real estate investments 
certain commitments to purchase real estate are contingent on the developer s development of the property according to plans and specifications outlined in a pre sale agreement or the completed property achieving a certain level of leasing 
these contractual commitments are typically entered into by prudential insurance on behalf of the particular separate account 
real estate investments that are acquired for a separate account are titled either in the name of prudential insurance or an llc subsidiary specifically formed to hold title 
in certain cases  the commitments specify that prudential insurance s recourse liability for the obligation is limited to the assets of the separate account 
at december  and  total outstanding purchase commitments related to such separate account activity were billion and billion  respectively  which amounts include both off and on balance sheet commitments 
the decrease in total outstanding purchase commitments during the last twelve months was 
table of contents primarily driven by the satisfaction of outstanding debt commitments  which were funded from investor capital contributions and property sales 
the following is a summary of the outstanding purchase commitments for these separate account portfolios as of december  off balance sheet commitments include capital commitments and commitments with respect to properties that have not yet substantially satisfied pre conditions and are considered contingent liabilities 
on balance sheet commitments represent obligations which have substantially satisfied conditions to funding of the commitments

some separate accounts have also entered into syndicated credit facilities providing for borrowings in the aggregate amount of up to billion 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities 
these facilities also include loan to value ratio requirements and other financial covenants 
recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account 
as of december   these separate account portfolios had combined gross and net asset values of billion and billion  respectively 
at the time of maturity of a funding commitment  prudential insurance often endeavors to negotiate extensions  refinancings  or other solutions with counterparties 
management believes that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to ultimately meet their obligations 
however  there is a risk that the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales  operating cash flow  deposits from clients  debt refinancings or from the above mentioned portfolio level credit facilities 
in cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations  prudential insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions 
to date  prudential insurance has not been required to provide any such funding 
as of december  and  our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion and billion  respectively

because valid rights of set off exist  interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the debt securities are settled on a net basis  and the surplus notes are reflected in the company s total consolidated borrowings on a net basis 
prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the subsidiary issuer in order to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts 
in addition  during  another subsidiary of prudential insurance issued a billion surplus note to an affiliate to finance reserves required under guideline axxx 
subsidiaries of prudential insurance have outstanding an additional billion of surplus notes that were issued in and to finance reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
prudential financial has agreed to maintain the capital of these subsidiaries at or above a prescribed minimum level and has entered into arrangements which are accounted for as derivative instruments that require it to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of these surplus notes 
as of december   there were no collateral postings made under these derivative instruments 
the surplus notes described above are subordinated to policyholder obligations  and the payment of interest and principal on the surplus notes may only be made with prior regulatory approval 
as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  we expect to have additional borrowing needs to finance statutory reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
however  we believe we have sufficient financing resources in place  including those described above  to meet our financing needs under regulation xxx through and under guideline axxx through the year  assuming that the volume of new business remains consistent with current sales levels 

table of contents funding agreement notes issuance program in  prudential insurance established a funding agreement notes issuance program pursuant to which a delaware statutory trust issues medium term notes which are included in our statements of financial position in policyholders account balances and not included in the foregoing table secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by prudential insurance and included in our retirement segment 
the funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium term notes 
the medium term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the securities act of the notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from five to ten years 
as of december  and  the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled billion and billion respectively  out of a total authorized amount of up to billion 
our ability to issue under this program depends on market conditions 
the aggregate maturities of these notes over the next months are approximately billion 
we intend to repay the maturing notes through a combination of cash flows from asset maturities and available cash 
credit facilities in december  we replaced our previously existing billion of revolving credit facilities  by entering into a new billion five year credit facility with financial institutions that has prudential financial as borrower and a new billion three year credit facility with financial institutions that has both prudential financial and prudential funding as borrowers 
there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities as of december  or as of the date of this filing 
each of the new facilities is available to the applicable borrowers up to the aggregate committed credit and may be used for general corporate purposes  including as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs 
prudential financial expects that it may borrow under the five year credit facility from time to time to fund its working capital needs and those of its subsidiaries 
in addition  up to million of the five year facility may be drawn in the form of standby letters of credit that can be used to meet the company s operating needs 
the credit facilities contain representations and warranties  covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type  however  borrowings under the facilities are not contingent on our credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses 
borrowings under the credit facilities are conditioned on the continued satisfaction of other customary conditions  including the maintenance at all times of consolidated net worth  relating to the company s financial services businesses only  of at least billion  which for this purpose is calculated as us gaap equity  excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss and excluding equity of noncontrolling interests 
under the applicable credit agreements  the required minimum level of consolidated net worth will be reduced automatically in the future by an amount equal to percent of the amount of any reduction  on an after tax basis  in the total us gaap equity attributable to the company s financial services businesses  resulting from the company s expected retrospective application of amended authoritative guidance regarding the deferral of costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts 
as of december   the consolidated net worth of the company s financial services businesses exceeded the minimum amount required to borrow under the credit facilities 
we also use uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions 
ratings financial strength ratings which are sometimes referred to as claims paying ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products 
nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate  including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries 
our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the 
table of contents number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors  distributors  or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability  liquidity  and or capital 
in addition  we consider our own risk of non performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities 
therefore  changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities 
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy 
credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity s ability to repay its indebtedness

each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
these ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock 
these ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future 
requirements to post collateral or make other payments as a result of ratings downgrades under certain agreements  including derivative agreements  can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
a ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of december  relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately million 
the amount of collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our derivative agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best to a for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately billion  based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate  that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately million  or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust 
we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
rating agencies use an outlook statement for both industry sectors and individual companies 
for an industry sector  a stable outlook generally implies that over the next months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector 
currently  am best  s p  moody s and fitch all have the am life insurance industry on stable outlook 
for a particular company  an outlook generally indicates a medium or long term trend generally six months to two years in credit fundamentals  which if continued  may lead to a rating change 
these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice 
moody s currently has all of the company s ratings on positive outlook 
except as noted below  am best  s p  and fitch currently have the company s ratings on stable outlook 
in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  have requested additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels  such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
the following is a summary of the significant changes in our ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from the beginning of through the date of this filing

contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
in addition  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows  such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments  nor all aspects of our cash outflows 
estimated payments due by period total and thereafter in millions short term and long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations commitments to purchase or fund investments commercial mortgage loan commitments other liabilities insurance liabilities other total the estimated payments due by period for long term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as estimated future interest payments 
the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short term and long term debt 
the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no significant capital lease obligations 

table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
for further discussion of these separate account commitments  see liquidity and capital resources of subsidiaries asset management subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 
the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  policyholder s dividends  reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current policies in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of  billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  cash collateral for loaned securities  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  bank customer liabilities  and other miscellaneous liabilities 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december  off balance sheet arrangements guarantees and other contingencies in the course of our business  we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future 
see commitments and guarantees within note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other contingent commitments we also have other commitments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties

other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions  arrangements or relationships that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support  that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  equity prices or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk 
the market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk vary by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate accounts in our variable life insurance and annuity products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management and derivative strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity  but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics  of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements within the context of market conditions and other relative opportunities 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
certain products supported by general account investments also expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts 
in a declining or sustained low interest rate environment  our ability to achieve desired spreads can become limited by minimum guaranteed crediting rates associated with some of our variable life insurance and annuity products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate accounts associated with these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  we are exposed to the risk that asset based fees may decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment values 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
the risk of decreased asset based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
while a decrease in our estimates of total gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period  it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of interest rate  equity market  or market volatility changes may increase our net exposure to the guarantees under these contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we utilize product design elements such as asset allocation restrictions  an automatic rebalancing element and minimum purchase age requirements  in addition to externally purchased hedging instruments such as interest rate and equity based derivatives to help to hedge or limit our market risk exposure to the benefit features of certain of our variable annuity contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts  and the guaranteed minimum income  withdrawal  and accumulation benefits associated with our variable annuity contracts 
for a discussion of asset based fees associated with our variable life products and our variable annuity contracts  our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  and the impact of our guaranteed minimum death and other benefits on the results of our individual life and individual annuities segments  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us individual

for risk management purposes we perform stress scenario testing to monitor the impact of extreme  but realistic adverse market events on our capital adequacy and liquidity 
this testing allows us to assess the sensitivity of our businesses to market factors and identify any concentrations of risk 
the regulatory capital levels and liquidity of our insurance companies in particular are closely monitored to ensure they remain consistent with our rating objectives 
changes to these ratings could impact our borrowing costs  our ability to access alternative sources of liquidity  and our ability to market certain products 
for additional information regarding our liquidity and capital resources see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
market fluctuations or changes in market conditions could also cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long term savings  protection and other investment products 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest rate and other market fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability see item a 
risk factors 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques  which include sensitivity and value at risk  or var  measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  retirement and annuities products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance and annuities products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage interest rate and equity exposure risk  as well as credit  liquidity and other risks  all within policy constraints set by management and approved by the investment committee of the board of directors 
for additional information regarding the management of our general account investments and our asset mix strategies  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments management of investments 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we use asset liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints by segment for each insurance entity 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us  capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the constraint limits 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our us regulatory cash flow for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest 
table of contents sensitive assumptions under various adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented and of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and  respectively 
with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  collectively referred to as investment contracts  and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates  reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk free rate 
the following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
as of december  notional fair value hypothetical fair value after basis point parallel yield curve shift hypothetical change in fair value in millions financial assets with interest rate risk fixed maturities commercial mortgage and other loans policy loans derivatives swaps futures options forwards variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives financial liabilities with interest rate risk short term and long term debt debt of consolidated variable interest entities investment contracts bank customer liabilities net estimated potential loss

the hypothetical change in fair value related to our variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives reflects only the gross fair value change on the embedded derivatives  and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes in fair value 
included in other liabilities together with all liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities 
the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  which are not considered financial liabilities 
we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities  including investment contracts  which are set forth in these tables 
our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of december  increased  million from december   primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in the increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in was primarily due to the acquisition of the star and edison businesses on february   as well as portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value primarily driven by a net decrease in interest rates 
the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell for us equities 
for foreign equities we benchmark against the tokyo price index  or topix  and the msci eafe  a market index of european  australian  and far eastern equities 
we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated investment equity price risk as of december  was  million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity 
table of contents securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us 
in addition to equity securities  as indicated above  we hold equity based derivatives primarily to hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products  as well as part of our capital hedging program described further below 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a billion liability 
as of december   our equity based derivatives had notional values of billion  and were reported at fair value as a million asset  and the living benefits features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a million asset 
our estimated equity price risk associated with living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives  net of the related equity based derivatives used in our living benefits hedging program  was a million benefit as of december  and a million benefit as of december   estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels 
the higher sensitivity level as of december  primarily reflects a greater impact from our own risk of non performance  driven by a higher base of embedded derivative liabilities and widening credit spreads  as this risk does not have an offsetting impact on the hedge assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of our own risk of non performance on the valuation of the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in addition  beginning in the second quarter of  we have entered into equity index linked derivative transactions that are designed to mitigate the impact of a severe equity market stress event on statutory capital 
the program focuses on tail risk to protect our capital in a cost effective manner under stress scenarios 
we continue to assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis  and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the company s risk position or other factors 
our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges was a benefit of million and million as of december  and  respectively  estimated based on a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels  which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
these scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue  changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality  utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features 
in addition  these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk  such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
the impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity based derivatives and the related living benefit features  in comparison to the scenarios above 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios  other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and foreign currency liability issuances 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into us dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 

table of contents our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency risk first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations primarily in japan  korea and taiwan 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
for our equity investments in our japanese and taiwanese operations  we generally hedge this exposure through a combination of issuing foreign denominated liabilities outside these operations and by holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations 
third  our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries investing in us dollar denominated investments 
most significantly  our japanese operations hold investments denominated in us dollars and australian dollars in their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations 
these investments support product liabilities in the corresponding currencies 
for a discussion of our japanese operations investments denominated in us dollars and australian dollars  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments portfolio composition  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance division 
we manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks  described above  within specified limits 
foreign currency exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
the estimated var as of december  for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from billion to billion 
the estimated one month var as of december  increased driven by a higher level of exchange rate volatility experience during the average var for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries  measured monthly at a confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during the average one month var for increased in comparison to due to the higher level of exchange rate volatility experience during these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
the estimated var for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the increased var for foreign currency exchange risks primarily reflects an increase in the size of the investment portfolio driven by the acquisition of the star and edison businesses on february   as well as increased volatility in exchange rates for japanese yen and korean won 

table of contents derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
derivatives also include guarantees we provide on investment only  fee based stable value products  which are classified as interest rate derivatives 
we are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
additionally  we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions 
we manage credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties  and by obtaining collateral where appropriate 
additionally  limits are set on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities and credit risk as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  as well as equity prices  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts 
the notional amount of derivative instruments increased billion in  from billion as of december  to billion as of december   driven by an increase in interest rate derivatives  primarily related to our variable annuity hedging activities  and an increase in investment only  fee based stable value products sold in our retirement segment 
we use credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments  and purchase credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio 
for additional information regarding our exposure to credit derivatives  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations realized investment gains and losses and general account investments general account investments fixed maturity securities credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities 
trading activities our derivatives trading operations engage in trading in a non dealer capacity  maintaining trading positions to manage interest rate  currency  credit and equity exposures in our insurance  investment and international businesses  and treasury operations 
our derivative transactions involve both exchange listed and over the counter contracts and are generally short term in duration 
market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
prior to the sale of our global commodities business on july   our trading activities included those in which we acted as a broker  buying and selling exchange listed contracts for our customers  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors 
the total var for our trading activities  which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  the total average daily var for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodities price risk  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during both and 
table of contents limitations of var models although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
