item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation production and reserve information 
company reserve estimates our proved reserve information as of december  included in this annual report on form k was estimated by netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai  independent petroleum engineers 
a copy of nsai s summary reserve report is included as exhibit to this annual report on form k 
see note supplemental oil and gas reserve information unaudited to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in accordance with sec guidelines  nsai s estimates of future net revenues from our properties  and the pre tax present value of discounted future net cash flows pv and standardized measure thereof  were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions  which requires the use of the month average price for each product  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
the tables below set forth information as of december  with respect to our estimated proved reserves  the associated present value of discounted future net cash flows and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
neither the pv nor the after tax standardized measure is intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves we own 
the average prices weighted by production over the lives of the proved reserves used in the reserve report were per mcf of gas and per bbl of oil 
all of our proved undeveloped reserves as of december  became uneconomic at these prices and as a result were not included in the december  reserve estimates 
all of our proved reserves are located within the state of utah 

table of contents mcf of gas bbls of oil total mcfe total proved reserve quantities proved undeveloped proved developed total present value of discounted future net cash flows a a present value of discounted future net cash flows represents the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs  using the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december  without giving effect to derivative transactions  and were held constant throughout the life of the properties 
the average prices weighted by production over the lives of the proved reserves used in the reserve report were per mcf of gas and per bbl of oil 
all of our proved undeveloped reserves became uneconomic at these prices and as a result were not included in the december  reserve estimates 
these prices should not be interpreted as a prediction of future prices 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the pv amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
non gaap present value reconciliation management uses discounted future net cash flows  which are calculated without deducting estimated future income tax expenses  and the present value thereof as one measure of the value of the company s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes 
we also understand that securities analysts and rating agencies use this measure in similar ways 
while future net revenue and present value are based on prices  costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company 
the pv reserve measurement is considered to be a non gaap financial measure  however as of december   the pv and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows are equal because the effects of estimated future income tax expenses are zero

we also maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with nsai to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to nsai in their reserves estimation process 
in the fourth quarter  our technical team meets regularly with representatives of nsai to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in nsai s preparation of the year end reserves estimates 
while we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process  a preliminary copy of the nsai reserve report is reviewed by our audit committee with representatives of nsai and internal technical staff 
additionally  our senior management reviews and approves any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis 
reserve technologies proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
to achieve reasonable certainty  nsai employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include  but are not limited to  well logs  geologic maps and available down well and production data  seismic data and well test data

the table does not include acreage that we have a contractual right to acquire or to earn through drilling projects  or any other acreage for which we have not yet received leasehold assignments 
in certain leases  our ownership is not the same for all depths  therefore  the net acres in these leases are calculated using the greatest ownership interest at any depth 
generally this greater interest represents our ownership in the primary objective formation

as of december   approximately of the gross acreage that we hold is located on federal lands  approximately of the acreage is located on state lands and is located on land owned by individuals 
it has been our experience that the permitting process related to the development of acreage on federal lands is more time consuming and expensive than the permitting process related to acreage on state lands 
we have generally been able to obtain state permits within days  while obtaining federal permits has taken approximately months or longer 
if we are delayed in procuring sufficient drilling permits for our federal properties  we will shift more of our drilling in utah to our state leases 
while such a shift in resources would not necessarily affect the rate of growth of our cash flow  it would result in a slower growth rate of our total proved reserves  because a higher percentage of the wells drilled on the state leases will be drilled on leases to which proved undeveloped reserves may already have been attributed 
additionally  if the development of our acreage located on federal lands is delayed significantly by the permitting process  we may have to operate at a loss for an extended period of time 
such delays could result in impairments of the carrying value of our unproved properties and could impact the ceiling test calculation 
during  we reclassified  of unproved acreage costs in nevada into proved property as we do not have future drilling plans for this acreage 
after this impairment  the aggregate carrying value of our unproved acreage is approximately  as of december  drilling activity the following table sets forth our drilling activity during the years ended december   and as of december   we had two wells in progress and these wells were completed during january

the compliance order alleges that we violated the clean water act by discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to the green river in utah without authorization on two occasions once when we constructed an access road to a future well location in either or and once when we constructed an access road and a well pad in or the compliance order directs us to remove all dredged or fill material alleged to have been placed in the wetlands and to restore the wetlands to their pre impact condition and grade  which would require that we plug and abandon the well alleged to have been installed in a wetlands area 
the compliance order does not seek any civil penalties for the alleged violations 
we disagree with some of the factual contentions in the compliance order  and have had a number of discussions with the epa concerning the order 
if a successful resolution cannot be negotiated  we intend to evaluate our options  which may include challenging the compliance order in federal court  although whether such compliance order may be appealed at this stage of the administrative

the capital expenditure budget will be allocated among our drilling program which includes the drilling of wells  our continued up hole recompletion program targeting natural gas and our additional investment in existing and new california oil and natural gas prospects in the san joaquin basin 
our capital expenditure program will be funded primarily from cash received from the closing of the transaction with wapiti  cash on hand and cash flow from operations

the decrease in production during was primarily due to normal production declines  partially offset by the completion of new and existing wells during our proved reserve quantities decreased by approximately and during the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to production declines during both years that were not offset by the extensions and discoveries in each year 
the revisions of reserve estimates during and were primarily due to better than anticipated well performance related to behind pipe reserves that began producing during both years 
the revisions of reserve estimates during were due primarily to a decrease in the gas price from per mcf at december  to per mcf at december  which caused some of our wells to become uneconomic

table of contents gas oil mcf bbls proved developed reserves balance  december  balance  december  balance  december  liquidity and capital resources general we generate cash from operations from the sale of oil and natural gas  and have relied in the past primarily on the issuance of equity  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and farm out and other similar types of transactions to fund working capital and the acquisition of our prospects and leases 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  and negative working capital of  which includes  of current debt maturities that were repaid in march as discussed below 
on march   we closed the previously announced transaction with wapiti  pursuant to which we i sold to wapiti an undivided interest in certain of our uinta basin producing oil and gas assets for million in cash and million in the form of a promissory note payable by wapiti and ii transferred to wapiti an undivided of our interest in our uinta basin non producing oil and gas assets in exchange for  among other agreements  wapiti s commitment to fund million of the drilling and completion costs associated with the exploration and development of the subject assets 
of wapiti s million funding commitment  million will be paid on our behalf  and we have agreed to provide an additional million of drilling and completion costs 
accordingly  the total program will be million  provided that  if on february   the five year new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas strip pricing is at least mmbtu  the drilling and completion program will be expanded by million to million with wapiti paying for million and us paying million of the additional costs 
we used approximately million of the proceeds from this transaction to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and we will use the remaining proceeds for capital expenditures consisting approximately million for our drilling program which includes the drilling of wells  our continued up hole recompletion program targeting natural gas and for additional investment in existing and new california oil and gas prospects in the san joaquin basin  working capital  acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and other general corporate purposes 
during we received approximately million in net proceeds from two stock offerings 
see further discussion in item business and recent highlights 
our credit facility will mature in june  at which time we will be required to repay all of the outstanding borrowings thereunder 
we are discussing alternative borrowing arrangements with other lenders and while we currently believe that we will be able to find a replacement lender  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all 
for example  our recent results of operations and volatility in oil and gas prices as well as in the domestic credit and capital markets generally may negatively affect the availability and terms of financing 
if we were to secure an alternative borrowing arrangement  we expect that such arrangement will include less 
table of contents favorable terms  including with respect to the cost of borrowing and financial covenants  than those of our previous credit facility 
if we are unable to secure an alternative borrowing arrangement  we will lose a primary source of liquidity and be required to fund our business and operations going forward without outside capital 
we believe that cash on hand including proceeds from the uinta basin transaction as well as future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital purposes and normal capital expenditures through the first quarter of however  there can be no assurance regarding these matters given that we will require significant additional capital to fund our future drilling activities and to meet our future debt maturities 
failure to generate operating cash flow or to obtain additional financing for the development of our properties could result in substantial dilution of our property interests or delay or cause indefinite postponement of further exploration and development of our prospectus with the possible loss of our properties 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including further reducing our exploration and development plans 
in particular  we face uncertainties relating to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund the level of capital expenditures required for oil and gas exploration and production activities and for working capital purposes 
we intend to fund our anticipated cash requirements through the first quarter of  including our capital budget of million  primarily through cash on hand and cash flows from operations  although we cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund such requirements 
our inability to secure replacement financing for the revolving credit facility or otherwise access future borrowings will significantly limit our ability to fund or increase our operating budget and to execute our growth plans 
if we need additional liquidity for future activities  we may be required to consider several options for raising such funds  such as selling additional securities  selling assets or executing farm out or similar arrangements  but we may be unable to complete any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any financing obtained through the sale of our equity will likely result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
capital resources on june   we closed an underwritten registered offering of  units the june offering at a price of per unit  for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock the june warrants 
the shares of common stock and june warrants were issued separately

the net proceeds from the august offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately the warrants are exercisable immediately for a term of sixty months  beginning at issuance  at an initial exercise price of per share  however  the exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable on exercise of the warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of any stock split  reverse stock split  stock dividend  recapitalization  reorganization or similar transaction 
if we make a distribution of our assets to all of our stockholders  holders of the warrants may be entitled to participate 
in the event of a fundamental transaction as defined in the warrants  at the election of a holder of a warrant  we may 
table of contents be required to purchase the holder s warrant for cash in an amount equal to the value of the remaining unexercised portion of the warrant 
subject to certain exceptions  if the average of the daily volume weighted average price of a share of common stock for some period of time equals or exceeds of the initial exercise price of the warrants  and if at the time of such measurement the equity conditions as defined in the warrants are satisfied  then we may  subject to certain conditions  require the holders of the warrants to exercise

forward sales contracts during march  pursuant to the base contract for sale and purchase of natural gas with anadarko energy services company  dated december   we entered into a term sales and transportation transaction to sell up to  mmbtu per day of our gross production through from the uinta basin 
the transaction contains two pricing mechanisms up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the nw rockies first of month price and up to  mmbtu per day will be priced at the first of the month index price as published by gas daily for the north west wyoming poll index price 
we account for our agreement to physically settle our production as an executory contract 
derivatives our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our natural gas derivative instruments consist of a costless collar agreement which contains a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  we will receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
this collar agreement is for  mmbtu day with a call price of mmbtu and a put price of mmbtu for production from january  through december  as of december   natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of three swap agreements for production through december the fair value our derivative instruments was a current asset of   as of december  and  respectively 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our economically hedged 
table of contents production 
see further discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and natural gas properties and reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  the ceiling test provides that capitalized costs less related accumulated depletion and deferred income taxes for each cost center may not exceed the sum of the present value of future net revenue from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves using current prices  excluding the future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  at a discount factor of  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less income tax effects related to differences in the book and tax basis of oil and gas properties 
should the net capitalized costs for a cost center exceed the sum of the components noted above  a ceiling test write down would be recognized to the extent of the excess capitalized costs exceed this ceiling 
as of march   our full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per bbl and per mcf 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended march  there was no additional impairment recorded for the remainder of or during or estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on us because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the overall value of our company 
estimated quantities are affected by changes in commodity prices and actual well performance 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved properties 
if our reserve quantities change or if additional costs are reclassified from unproved properties into proved properties  depletion expense could be significantly affected 
estimating accumulations of natural gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of our wells have been producing less than ten years  their 
table of contents production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the estimates of our proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as our wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
for example  a decrease in prices used to estimate our reserve quantities as of december  would result in a decrease in the present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing natural gas and oil prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
our management reviews all unproved property each quarter 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that we do not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  we record an impairment of the acreage and reclassify the costs to the full cost pool 
we estimate the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that we have recorded were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by us 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that we do not plan to develop in order to calculate the impairment 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total impairment recorded by us  calculation of depletion expense and the ceiling test analysis 
stock based compensation we account for stock option and sars grants  and restricted stock awards by recognizing compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of option and sars awards 
this model requires us to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of our common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
derivatives we have entered into certain commodity derivative instruments to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
we record all derivative instruments at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we recorded a change in the fair value of commodity derivative instruments of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also recorded a change in the fair value of our outstanding warrants of  during  see note stock offerings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during we recorded a change in fair value of an embedded derivative associated with the exchange 
table of contents of our convertible senior notes due the notes for notes the exchange transaction of  see note convertible senior notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the fair value of the natural gas agreements was a current asset of  the fair value measurement of the commodity derivative assets and liabilities are measured based upon our valuation model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c notional quantities  d current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments and e the counterparty s credit risk 
the unobservable inputs related to the volatility of the oil and gas commodity market are very significant in these calculations 
continued volatility in these markets could have a significant impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
see note fair value measurements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our warrant derivative financial instrument as of december  was a noncurrent liability of  as further described in note stock offerings to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the warrants are valued using a binomial lattice based valuation model 
the lattice based valuation technique is utilized because it embodies all of the requisite assumptions including the underlying price  exercise price  term  volatility  and risk free interest rate that are necessary to measure the fair value of these instruments 
estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may  and are likely to  change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors 
in addition  option based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading price of our common stock  which has a high historical volatility

as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements  gathering  compression  processing and water disposal agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we address these risks through a program of risk management which includes the use of derivative instruments 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments to which we were a party at december   and from which we may incur future gains or losses from changes in commodity prices or market interest rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
hypothetical changes in commodity prices and interest rates chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analyses are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in commodity prices and interest rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
further  our cash equivalents and derivative instruments are exposed to concentrations of credit risk 
we manage and control this risk by placing these funds and contracts with major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
our receivables are comprised of oil and gas revenue receivables and joint interest billings receivable  which amounts are due from a limited number of entities 
therefore  collectability is dependent upon the general economic conditions of the few purchasers and joint interest owners 
the receivables are not collateralized  however  to date  we have had minimal bad debts 
commodity price risk our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our derivative instruments consisted of one costless collar agreement for our production from january  through december  at recent production levels  approximately of our net production volumes have been hedged through these instruments 
the counterparty in each of these instruments is the administrative agent under the credit facility 
as of december   the fair value of these agreements is a current asset of  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
our derivative contracts are described below for our swap instrument  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
our costless collar contains a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments will be due from either party 
the swap and collar contracts allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices that we will receive for our hedged production and to benefit from operating cash flows when market prices are less than the fixed prices of the contracts 
however  we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for the hedged production 
our hedging contracts have no requirements for us to post additional collateral based upon the changes in the market value of our hedge instruments 

table of contents our costless collar agreement as of december  is summarized in the table below agreement type remaining term quantity index price a call price counterparty buyer put price gasco buyer costless collar  mmbtu day nw rockies mmbtu mmbtu a northwest pipeline rocky mountains inside ferc first of month index price 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
based on our average daily production for the year ended december  and including the impact of the commodity derivative instruments in place as of december   our annual revenue would increase or decrease by approximately  for each per bbl change in crude oil prices and  for each per mcf change in natural gas prices 
warrant derivative risk on june   we issued the june warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and on august   we issued the august warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants have an initial exercise price of per share subject to adjustment with a sixty month term  as further described in note stock offerings of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the warrants contain a contingent cash settlement provision at the option of the holder and accordingly  are classified as a derivative liability and are subject to the classification and measurement standards for derivative financial instruments 
estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may  and are likely to  change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors 
in addition  option based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading price of our common stock  which has a high historical volatility 
with all other factors remaining constant as of december  i the warrant derivative liability would decrease by approximately million for a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and would increase by approximately million for a increase in the trading price of our common stock 
ii the warrant derivative liability would increase decrease by approximately  by a increase decrease in the volatility rate 
interest rate risk we do not currently use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
a increase in interest rates on the average borrowings outstanding during would increase interest expense by approximately  per year
