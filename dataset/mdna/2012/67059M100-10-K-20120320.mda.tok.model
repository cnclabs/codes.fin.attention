item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of branded therapeutics for diseases of the central nervous system  including neurological and psychiatric disorders 
our most advanced product candidate  np also referred to as zelrix and our migraine patch  is an active  single use transdermal sumatriptan patch that we are developing for the treatment of migraine 
np uses our proprietary smartrelief technology 
if approved  np will be the first transdermal patch indicated for the treatment of migraine 
following approval  we plan to build our own specialty sales force to launch np in the us along with a partner and intend to seek a partner to market np outside the us we have two other proprietary product candidates in preclinical development that address large market opportunities  np for the continuous symptomatic treatment of parkinson s disease  and np for the long term treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
we are seeking a co development partner for np and we plan to submit an investigational new drug application ind for np in we were incorporated in the state of delaware in january and are a development stage company 
since our inception  we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of np np is the only product candidate for which we have conducted clinical trials  and to date we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products 
as a result  we have generated no product revenue and have never been profitable 
our net loss for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations to date primarily with the proceeds of the sale of common stock  convertible preferred stock  warrants  convertible notes and borrowings under credit facilities 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock  convertible preferred stock  warrants and convertible notes 
since inception  we have also received million of proceeds from term loans 
we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to develop our product candidates  seek marketing approval and eventually commercialize np and our other product candidates 
if we obtain marketing approval for np  we will incur significant sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution expenses 
our future capital needs will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully complete the additional trials  tests  device enhancement  packaging modification and other activities to support the resubmission of our new drug application nda for np and our ability to obtain a waiver of a dermal carcinogenicity study  the timing and outcome of the us food and drug administration s fda review of our nda resubmission for np  including the extent to which the fda may request or require us to provide additional information or undertake additional trials or studies  the cost  scope and timing of activities undertaken to prepare for commercialization of np  the scope  progress  results and costs of development for our other product candidates  
table of contents the extent to which we acquire or invest in new products  businesses and technologies  and the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration  co promotion  distribution or other similar agreements for np and our other product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and interest obligations into the third quarter of we will require additional capital to fund our operations and capital requirements beyond that point 
there is no assurance that such capital will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended december  related to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have prepared our financial statements on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence 
regulatory status we submitted a nda for np to the fda in october in august we received a complete response letter crl from the fda 
a crl is issued by the fda when the questions remain that preclude the fda from approving the nda in its present form 
in the crl  the fda acknowledged that the efficacy of np in the overall migraine population was established 
the crl primarily contained chemistry  manufacturing and safety questions 
in november  we had an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss certain questions contained in the crl and our approach for addressing such questions 
based on the crl and our discussion with fda at this meeting  we believe the primary outstanding issues are product containment and uniformity of dosage 
we are making minor modifications to the product packaging and providing additional data in order to characterize the uniformity of dosage 
demonstrating that np can be used correctly by patients 
we will be conducting a new patient usability study with np s revised packaging 
development and validation of a new in vitro testing method 
we have developed a new in vitro testing method and validation is ongoing 
we believe this new method meets applicable fda criteria 
the new method will be included in our resubmission and used to qualify newly manufactured product 
the potential for np to cause application site adverse events that result in permanent skin effects 
in our phase iii clinical program  consisting of patients applying approximately  np patches  four patients experienced application site adverse events that resulted in a small mark on the skin 
these marks occurred because np was not applied correctly 
to address this issue we are implementing a device enhancement that will prevent np from activating in the event that it is applied incorrectly 
completion of two phase i trials 
one trial is to verify the performance of our planned device enhancement and the other  which has been completed  was a repeat of a phase i trial that assessed the pharmacokinetics of np compared to oral imitrex because the clinical site that performed the original trial did not retain sufficient samples 
pharmacokinetics refers to a drug s absorption  distribution and metabolism in  and excretion from  the body and measures  among other things  bioavailability of a drug  or concentration of drug in the plasma 
justification for waiver of a dermal carcinogenicity study 
in order to qualify for a waiver  we believe we must demonstrate that sumatriptan is not passively absorbed through the skin 
we 
table of contents have clinical and preclinical data confirming that there is no passive absorption and will include these data in our resubmission 
in addition to these primary issues  we are addressing the other questions raised by the fda in the crl 
by providing additional data and following fda recommendations  we believe we can address these questions to the satisfaction of the fda in our nda resubmission 
we expect to resubmit our nda in the first half of after completing the activities discussed above 
we believe our resubmission will result in a six month review period under the prescription drug user fee act  which will be the target date for the fda to complete its review of the nda 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   of which million is required to be maintained under the terms of our loan and security agreement term loan facility 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
during  we used million of cash for operating activities and million for investing activities  which were partially funded from million of net cash provided by financing activities primarily the million of gross proceeds from the issuance of additional debt 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt service and interest obligations into the third quarter of however  changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital faster than we currently anticipate  and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of such circumstances 
we will require additional capital to fund our operations and capital requirements beyond the third quarter of to meet our capital needs  we are considering multiple alternatives  including  but not limited to  additional equity financings  debt financings  corporate collaboration and licensing agreements  and other funding opportunities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction on acceptable terms or otherwise 
furthermore  the covenants and the pledge of our assets as collateral under the term loan facility limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
if we are unable to successfully complete the additional trials  tests  device enhancement  packaging modification and other activities to support the resubmission of our nda in a timely manner  our ability to obtain additional capital may be adversely affected 
until such time as we are able to secure the necessary funding  we plan to continue conserving our capital resources  predominantly by limiting investments to those activities related to the approval of np if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  will result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies  future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
if we are unable to raise the necessary capital  we will need to curtail operations significantly and modify our business strategy which may require us to delay  modify or abandon our operations and plans related to np and our other product candidates  pursue a plan to sell our assets or seek bankruptcy protection 
bankruptcy may result in the termination of agreements pursuant to which we license certain intellectual property rights 
additionally  failure to obtain additional capital may result in an event of default under our term loan facility 
our term loan facility contains customary events of default including upon the occurrence of a payment default  a covenant default  a material adverse change as defined therein and insolvency 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the interest on 
table of contents outstanding loans will be increased by over the rate that would otherwise be applicable 
in addition the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the facility as well as grant the lenders the right to exercise remedies with respect to the collateral which secures the facility 
aspire capital purchase agreement in august  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement purchase agreement with aspire capital fund  llc aspire capital  which provides that aspire capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock over the term of the purchase agreement 
upon execution of the purchase agreement  we issued  shares of common stock to aspire capital as a commitment fee in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement the commitment shares and we sold  shares of common stock to aspire capital at a per share purchase price of resulting in gross proceeds to us of  the initial purchase shares 
we have registered under the securities act of aspire capital s sale of the commitment shares  the initial purchase shares  and  additional shares that we may elect to sell to aspire capital under the purchase agreement 
the conditions to the commencement of sales under the purchase agreement were satisfied on august  as a result  on any trading day on which the closing sale price of common stock is not less than per share  we may direct aspire capital to purchase shares of company common stock at a known per share purchase price based on prevailing market prices  using a formula as set forth in the purchase agreement a regular purchase 
the maximum number of shares that we may direct aspire to purchase on any trading day pursuant to a regular purchase is  shares or such lesser number of shares that results in an aggregate purchase price of not greater than  in addition  on any trading day on which we direct aspire capital to make a regular purchase for the maximum number of shares set forth above  we may also direct aspire capital to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to up to of the aggregate shares of our common stock traded on the nasdaq global market on the next trading day a vwap purchase  subject to a maximum number of shares as we may determine and a minimum trading price  which is equal to the greater of a of the closing price of our common stock on the business day immediately preceding the vwap purchase date or b such higher price as we may set in the vwap purchase notice 
the per share purchase price of common stock sold to aspire capital pursuant to a vwap purchase is equal to of the volume weighted average price for such purchase date 
there are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the purchase agreement  and we will control the timing and amount of any stock sales to aspire capital 
aspire capital has no right to require any sales by us  but is obligated to make purchases from us as we direct in accordance with the purchase agreement 
there are no limitations on use of proceeds  financial or business covenants  restrictions on future financings  rights of first refusal  participation rights  penalties or liquidated damages in the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time  at our discretion  without any penalty or cost to us 
other than the commitment shares and initial purchase shares as referenced above  we have not made any sales to aspire capital during the year ended december  the extent to which we may utilize the purchase agreement as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors  including the prevailing market price of our common stock  the volume of trading in our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure funds from other sources 

table of contents key components of our statement of operations research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing  testing and seeking marketing approval of our product candidates  including expenses associated with regulatory submissions  preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing  personnel related expenses  such as salaries  benefits  travel and other related expenses  including stock based compensation  payments made to third party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf  payments to third party contract research organizations  laboratories and independent contractors  expenses incurred to obtain technology licenses if the technology licensed has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  and facility  maintenance and other related expenses 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
preclinical development expenses and clinical trial expenses for our product candidates are a significant component of our current research and development expenses 
product candidates in later stage clinical development  such as np  generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we track and record information regarding external research and development expenses for each study or trial that we conduct 
from time to time  we use third party contract research organizations  laboratories and independent contractors in preclinical studies 
we recognize the expenses associated with third parties performing these services for us in our preclinical studies based on the percentage of each study completed at the end of each reporting period 
we coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors  including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits  direct pass through costs and other clinical site fees 
from our inception in january through december   we incurred research and development expenses of million  of which million was for the development of np inclusive of million of acquired in process research and development expense in connection with the patent application utilized by np  million was for the development of np and million was for to the development of np the remaining research and development expenses are for amounts incurred that we do not allocate to specific programs  such as personnel related expenses  including salaries and benefits  as well as general fixed costs for our facility and related expenses 
we will continue to incur research and development expenses in related to the development of np and  following the receipt of additional capital  expect to incur research and development expenses in for the development of np these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties regarding timing and cost to completion 
we currently anticipate submitting an ind for np in due to the early stage of development  we are not currently able to determine the duration and completion costs of our np development projects 
we are seeking to partner for the continued development of np 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  marketing  market research and human resource functions 
our selling  general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs not included in research and development expenses  professional fees for legal  including patent related expenses  expenses related to market research and commercialization preparation activities  consulting  tax and accounting services  insurance  depreciation and general corporate expenses 
interest income and interest expense our interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
our interest expense consists primarily of cash and non cash interest costs related to our outstanding debt 
additionally  in connection with some of our debt financings  we issued warrants  the fair value of which we recorded as deferred financing costs 
we amortize these deferred financing costs over the lives of the loans as interest expense in our statement of operations 
prior to our initial public offering ipo  on a quarterly basis these warrants were marked to market  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s gaap  and any change in fair value was recorded as interest expense in our statement of operations 
upon the completion of our ipo  these warrants were reclassified into stockholders equity as they were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and are no longer required to be marked to market at each balance sheet date 
net operating losses and tax loss carryforwards our net loss was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have incurred cumulative net losses of million from inception through december  as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and state research and development credits available to offset future taxable income 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize the benefit of any net operating loss carryforwards and credits  the deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards has been fully offset by a valuation allowance at december  our ipo  together with private placements and other equity financing transactions that have occurred since our inception  may trigger  or may have already triggered  an ownership change pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
if an ownership change is triggered  it will limit our ability to use some of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  since we will need to raise substantial additional funding to finance our operations  we may undergo further ownership changes in the future  which could further limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  if we generate taxable income  our ability to use some of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset us federal taxable income may be subject to limitations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap and are included in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to clinical trial expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under 
table of contents the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to our financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
research and development expenses although we manage the conduct of our own clinical trials  we rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies and to provide services  including data management  statistical analysis and electronic compilation for our clinical trials  as well as for the manufacture of our clinical trial supplies 
at the end of each reporting period  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress towards completion of the related project 
factors that we consider in preparing these estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  milestones achieved and other criteria related to the efforts of our vendors 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to vendors and estimated services provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expenses related to these costs 
we calculate expenses incurred for the manufacture of our clinical supplies using our estimate of costs and capitalize these expenses on our balance sheet to the extent we hold clinical supply materials on hand to be distributed for use in our clinical trials 
we expense these costs as the supplies are consumed in the trials 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of stock options  stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury instruments with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option 
as a newly public company  we do not have sufficient history to estimate the expected life of our options or the volatility of our common stock price 
we use comparable public companies as a basis for our expected volatility to calculate the fair value of our option grants 
we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using comparable companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available 
we use the simplified method  as allowed under the securities and exchange commission s sec accounting guidance  to determine the expected life  which is the midpoint between an option s vesting date and contractual term 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimate and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  stock based compensation could be materially different in the future 
prior to our ipo  the fair value of our common stock underlying grants of common stock options and restricted stock was determined by our board of directors or compensation committee 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
the issuance of asu is intended to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the guidance in asu supersedes the presentation options in asc topic and facilitates convergence of us gaap and ifrs by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requiring that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive 
table of contents statements 
asu is effective for interim periods and years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
the amendments are being made to allow the fasb time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
all other requirements in asu are not affected by this update  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the company does not believe the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue during the year ended december   the company was awarded  of qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp grants under section d of the us internal revenue code in connection with costs incurred during and for the company s np  np and np development programs

the company had no revenues during the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were comprised of the following year ended december  increase decrease in thousands clinical development manufacturing regulatory and quality assurance medical affairs n a compensation and related facilities and related research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in a significant reason for the decrease was a million reduction related to a waiver of the nda filing fee that we had paid to the fda in the fourth quarter of at the time of payment  we expensed the full million for the filing fee 
in march  we received notice from the fda that we qualified for a one time waiver and we would be receiving a refund of the million filing fee  which we received in june as a result  in march  we reversed the previously expensed amount of million which is classified as regulatory expense in the table above 

table of contents exclusive of this one time expense and subsequent reversal  research and development expenses would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million in clinical development expenses were million lower during as a result of a significant spending during for a month  repeat use trial for np initiated in the third quarter of as well as two pharmacokinetic trials and a tolerability trial initiated in early  most of which had concluded by the beginning of these higher clinical development expenses in were partially offset by the initiation  during the second half of  of a phase i bioequivalence trial for np in response to the fda s crl 
exclusive of the nda filing fee and subsequent refund discussed above  regulatory expenses would have been  and million during and  respectively  a decrease of million in this decrease was due primarily to the fact that included extensive consulting costs related to the filing of an electronic nda for np in manufacturing expense increased to million during from million during this increase was due primarily to manufacturing scale up expenses for np as well as expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of in order to address some of the chemistry and manufacturing questions included within the fda s crl 
partially offsetting the higher np manufacturing expenses in was a reduction of million related to the manufacturing development of np the np manufacturing development expenses were curtailed in as we focused our resources on the continued development of np the million of expense for medical affairs resulted from the expansion of our medical affairs function during  which was not initiated until very late in the million increase during for compensation and related expenses was driven by incremental research and development headcount  annual salary increases for research and development personnel  and increased non cash stock compensation expense

decreased spending on np in was primarily the result of our decision to focus our resources on the continued development of np  and therefore we delayed significant manufacturing development for np during modest expenditures on the nonclinical development of np continued throughout personnel related expenses  including salaries and benefits  are included in the table above as general development expenses as we do not allocate these expenses to specific programs 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase resulted partially from greater expenses related to the full year impact of being a public company  such as higher personnel costs due to additional employees  salary increases  higher stock based compensation expense and higher increased financial reporting expense and board of director s fees 
also contributing to the higher expenses was an additional million of expenses related to the growth of our commercial operations as we continued to prepare for the anticipated launch of np  including higher personnel costs and market research and consulting fees

we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in interest rates 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that reasonably possible near term fluctuations in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but may increase the interest expense associated with our debt 
we have no operations outside the us  however  we have an agreement with lts  a manufacturer in germany that provides services to us related to the production and assembly of np our payment obligations under this agreement are denominated in euros 
under this agreement  we paid million in  million in and million in to lts 
because of this agreement  we are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 
we do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro because we believe reasonably possibly near term fluctuations of such exchange rate would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we are currently in the process of transferring these manufacturing activities to one of lts s us subsidiaries and anticipate that our commercial manufacturing activities will be located in the us  thereby substantially eliminating our exposure to fluctuations in the relative values of the us dollar and the euro
