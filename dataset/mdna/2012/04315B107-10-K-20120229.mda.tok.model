these expenses include  but are not limited to  allocation of class b profits interests  change in redemption value of class b profits interests  tax receivable agreement  the de recognition of the deferred tax asset  as well as certain professional and licensing fees within general administrative expenses 
general overview business we are an asset management company that provides investment management services to institutional and mutual fund clients 
we manage and advise proprietary mutual funds  commingled institutional investment vehicles  institutional separate accounts  sub advisory accounts  and a hedge fund 
while our operations and clients are primarily us based  a substantial portion of our aum is invested outside of the us historically  our distribution activities were primarily focused within north america 
in  we opened offices in london  england  to expand our distribution activities to europe and the middle east  and in sydney  australia  to expand our distribution activities in australia  new zealand and parts of asia 
our revenues are primarily billed in us dollars and are calculated based on the us dollar value of the investment assets we manage for clients 
our managed portfolios have exposures to currencies other than the us dollar  which can affect our revenues 
as of december   of our aum were exposed to currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  changes in foreign currency exchange rates will affect our revenues 
our expenses are primarily billed and paid in us dollars and not significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rates  although our shareholder servicing expenses are driven by average daily market value of proprietary fund aum and therefore  indirectly impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 
for select new product initiatives  we invest in the related investment vehicles in order to provide critical mass 
we refer to these investments as seed money investments 
income from seed money investments is included in non operating income 
this income is  by nature  variable 
since the third quarter of  we have made aggregate seed money investments of million 
initial public offering and changes in principals interests prior to the completion of our september   ipo of investors class a common stock  which is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol art  investors was a wholly owned subsidiary of gam holding ag gam  a swiss corporation formerly known as julius baer holding ltd 
additionally  each principal had a class b profits interest in investment adviser  which was accounted for as compensation 
immediately prior to the ipo  each principal exchanged his class b profits interest for a non voting class a membership interest in holdings new class a units 
subsequent to the ipo  the principals new class a units have been accounted for as non controlling interests in holdings 
in  the principals exchanged million of their new class a units for million shares of our class a common stock  reducing their membership interests in holdings to approximately each 
at the time of the exchanges  we issued million shares of class a common stock in a synthetic offering to cover the principals taxes payable on the exchanges 
we did not retain any of the proceeds related to the synthetic offering 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including contingent liabilities  revenues  and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates and may have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
investments owned by the consolidated investment products  and other seed money investments if a seed money investment is required to be consolidated  it is reflected within the consolidated investment products 
in order to maintain consistency of accounting among all seed money investments  we elect the fair value option if a seed money investment is required to be carried under the equity method

table of contents fees receivable and accrued fees  net of allowance for doubtful accounts fees receivable and accrued fees  net of allowance for doubtful accounts represent fees earned that have been  or will be  billed to our clients 
we review receivables and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts if appropriate 
investment management fees investment management fees are recognized as earned 
fees on registered investment companies are computed and billed monthly as a percentage of average daily fair value of the funds aum 
fees on other vehicles and on separate accounts are computed and billed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable investment management agreements 
the investment management agreements for a small number of accounts and an insignificant amount of assets provide for performance fees 
performance fees  if earned  are recognized on the contractually determined measurement date 
performance fee clawback provisions  if any  are recognized when the amount is probable and estimable 
income taxes the majority of our deferred tax asset is recoverable over a year period 
recovery will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income 
uncertainty in income tax positions is accounted for by recognizing in the consolidated financial statements the benefit of a tax position that we have taken in a jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
management considers the facts and circumstances available in order to determine the appropriate tax benefit to recognize including tax legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law 
the ultimate outcome of the examination of a tax position may differ from management s estimate 
these differences could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
interest and penalties relating to tax liabilities are recognized on actual tax liabilities and exposure items 
interest is accrued according to the provisions of the relevant tax law and is reported as interest expense under non operating income loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
penalties are accrued and reported as general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 
contingencies investors accrues for estimated costs  including  if applicable  legal costs  when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact of current developments 
differences could exist between the actual outcome of a contingency and management s estimate 
although we may not have an explicit obligation to do so  we have  at our discretion  reimbursed client accounts for certain operational losses incurred 
economic environment as an investment manager  we derive substantially all of our operating revenues from providing investment management services to our institutional and mutual fund clients 
such revenues are driven by the amount and composition of our aum  as well as by our fee structure  making our business results sensitive to the prevailing global economic climate and its impact on investor sentiment and capital markets 
exhibited pronounced market gyrations in response to continued uncertainty over the state of the global economy and governmental policy responses 
even more unsettling for markets was the still unresolved sovereign debt crisis which became more acute during the third quarter 
the first half of the year proved relatively positive for financial markets overall 
however  this quickly reversed during the second half of the year as concerns over the future of the euro zone and the euro  as well as lingering recollections of the market declines led many investors to sell equities  high yield and other risk assets in favor of the relative safety of artio global investors inc annual report 
table of contents high quality bonds and cash 
despite a strong rebound in october  the vast majority of international equity markets ended substantially down  whereas the us equity market managed to end the year with positive returns 
with double digit declines across international equity markets in us dollar terms  our aum were significantly down for the year 
macro factors will likely continue to shape investor sentiment and drive market movements  particularly with respect to the ongoing sovereign debt crisis 
however  markets appear to reflect potential negative news to a large extent and recent data with respect to the us suggests the world s largest economy may be more resilient than initially thought 
europe continues to suffer the effects of tightened austerity measures amid the sovereign debt crisis and worries of a potential break up of the euro zone 
as headlines relating to this crisis continue  the risk on risk off stance by investors will likely continue for some time 
industry trends overall  equity markets trended downwards throughout our international equity strategies  which comprise of our total aum as of december   are measured against the msci ac world ex usa index  which decreased during heightened volatility may lead to continued de risking among certain investors 
during  high volatility resulted in significant net client cash outflows in certain asset classes within the industry 
industry commentators have identified several industry trends that may affect our client cash flows in the future  including growing interest from us institutions in cross border investing across asset classes  reduction in use of defined benefit plans  growing interest in passive equity  absolute return products and alternative investments  and a move by certain corporate pension plans towards a liability driven investment approach 
appetite for cross border investing across asset classes is constructive for many of our investment strategies  particularly interest from us institutions in global equity as an asset class 
however  events taking place within the euro zone  may curtail the appetite by investors to move away from a home country bias 
in the long term  we expect interest towards cross border investing to continue 
there is a long term trend away from defined benefit plans in favor of defined contribution plans 
this presents both opportunities and risks for active managers 
while there remains a strong case for active investment management across many asset classes  sustained growth in the market share of passive investments is viewed as unfavorable for active managers  such as us  as would a sustained move towards a liability driven investment approach 
expanded interest in both absolute return products and alternative investments present opportunities for active managers 
the extent to which our strategies participate in activity resulting from these trends will depend upon a number of factors  including product design  investment performance and access to decision makers

table of contents key performance indicators our management reviews our performance on a monthly basis  focusing on the indicators described below 
as of and for the year ended december  in millions  except basis points  percentages and per share amounts operating indicators a aum average aum b net client cash flows market appreciation depreciation financial indicators investment management fees effective fee rate basis points c adjusted operating income d adjusted operating margin e adjusted ebitda d adjusted ebitda margin e adjusted compensation ratio d f adjusted net income attributable to artio global investors d diluted earnings per share adjusted diluted earnings per share g a excluding legacy activities 
b average aum is computed on the beginning of first month balance and all end of month balances within the year 
c the effective fee rate is computed by dividing investment management fees by average aum for the year 
d see the adjusted performance measures section of this md a for reconciliations of employee compensation and benefits to adjusted compensation  operating income loss before income tax expense to adjusted operating income  net income loss to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda  and net income loss attributable to artio global investors to adjusted net income attributable to artio global investors 
e adjusted operating and adjusted ebitda margins are calculated by dividing adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda by total revenues and other operating income 
f calculated as adjusted compensation d divided by total revenues and other operating income 
g adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing adjusted net income attributable to artio global investors by adjusted weighted average diluted shares see the adjusted performance measures section of this md a 
operating indicators our revenues are driven by the amount and composition of our aum  as well as by our fee structure 
as a result  management closely monitors our aum 
we believe average aum is more useful than quarter end aum in analyzing performance during a period  as most of our fees are calculated based on daily or monthly aum  rather than quarter end balances of aum 
as noted in the industry trends section of this md a  global markets have generally declined  as has our performance  which has adversely affected our aum and revenues 
as of december   market depreciation decreased aum by billion  or  from december  net client cash flows represent purchases by new or existing clients  less redemptions 
our net client cash flows are driven by the performance of our investment strategies relative to their respective benchmark and or peers  absolute levels of performance  competitiveness of our fee rates  the success of our marketing and client service efforts  as well as clients appetite for risk and the state of equity and fixed income markets overall 
our net client cash flows also reflect client specific actions  such as portfolio rebalancing or decisions to change investment portfolio managers 
net client cash outflows were billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december   while net cash inflows were billion for the year ended december  artio global investors inc annual report 
table of contents in our view  the outflows reflect a variety of contributing factors  including underperformance in our international equity strategies  client rebalancing decisions  asset reallocations and clients adopting a different investment approach 
however  we believe underperformance in our international equity strategies was the primary factor driving net client cash outflows 
net client cash outflows and market depreciation in has resulted in a lower beginning of year aum in than  the impact of which will be fully reflected in our revenues in financial indicators management reviews certain financial ratios to monitor progress with internal forecasts  monitor our business drivers and compare our firm with others in the asset management industry 
the effective fee rate represents the amount of investment management fees we earn divided by the average dollar value of aum we manage 
this information can be used as an indicator of the contribution of our products to revenues 
adjusted operating and adjusted ebitda margins are important indicators of our profitability and the efficiency of our business model 
see the adjusted performance measures section of this md a for a discussion of financial indicators not prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
other ratios shown in the table on page allow us to review expenses in comparison with our revenues 
investment management fees are earned from managing clients assets and fluctuate based on the total value of aum  composition of aum among our investment vehicles and among our investment strategies  and changes in the investment management fee rates on our products 
fees from our international equity strategies are our primary revenue source and as a percentage of investment management fees were approximately in  in and in the decrease in revenue percentage from our international equity strategies reflects net client cash outflows in and  as well as market depreciation in our effective fee rate of basis points has declined slightly in recent years due primarily to an increase in the proportion of our average aum within our fixed income strategies  which typically have average fee rates lower than our equity strategies 
in  we implemented organizational changes  which included a staff reduction 
a charge of million related to the staff reduction includes severance and the acceleration of deferred and share based compensation charges 
our adjusted operating and adjusted ebitda margins in decreased compared to  as revenues declined faster than expenses 
although the decline in aum in has negatively impacted our revenues  we continued to generate solid adjusted operating and adjusted ebitda margins 
we expect our margin to come under additional pressure in  given the significant decline in aum 
adjusted performance measures certain of our financial indicators are adjusted versions of balances in our consolidated financial statements and are not prepared in conformity with gaap 
we believe these adjusted financial indicators are meaningful as they are more representative of our ongoing expense base than their gaap counterparts 
we exclude the one time severance and related costs associated with our staff reduction in  certain compensation costs related to a compensation structure that was discontinued after our initial public offering ipo in and the amortization expense associated with equity awards granted to employees at the time of our ipo 
we also present adjusted net income attributable to artio global investors per diluted share  which assumes the full exchange of our principals non controlling interests for class a common stock at the beginning of each period presented 
this adjustment does not conform with gaap  for those periods in which the shares are antidilutive 
in such periods  the adjustment has the effect of increasing earnings per share 
these adjustments are reflected in adjusted operating income  adjusted operating margin  adjusted compensation ratio  adjusted net income attributable to artio global investors  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin also exclude the effects of non operating income 
we have adjusted income taxes to reflect the appropriate effective tax rate for each period after taking into consideration these non gaap adjustments

table of contents assets under management aum changes to our aum  the distribution of our aum among our investment products and investment strategies  and the effective fee rates on our products  all affect our operating results from one year to another 
the amount and composition of our aum are influenced by a variety of factors including  among other things investment performance  including our investment decisions and fluctuations in both the financial markets and foreign currency exchange rates  client cash flows into and out of our investment products  the mix of aum among our various strategies  and our introduction or closure of investment strategies and products 
we manage assets across different strategies  within six asset classes  including international equity  global equity  us equity  high grade fixed income  high yield  and local emerging markets debt

despite a rebound in markets in october  absolute returns for the full year remained negative for our strategies and the index 
although relative returns versus the index were negative for the first half of  the rapid shift in sentiment amid the deteriorating sovereign debt situation led to the majority of the underperformance of our international equity strategies to occur during the latter half of the year 
given expectations that demand for goods and artio global investors inc annual report 
table of contents services coming from the emerging markets would be stronger than that of the developed world due to limited leverage and low penetration levels  we focused our investment selection on companies geared toward continued growth in the developing world 
this included both developed world based exporters and leading emerging markets based companies 
however  the risk off environment  combined with concerns of a global slow down  adversely impacted the strategies overweight positioning in such investments  driving the bulk of underperformance 
specifically for the year  within the developed world  our overweight positions in certain export oriented consumer related and capital goods stocks contributed to negative performance 
the overweight to developed market materials also had a negative impact  as did stock selection within the energy sector 
while we benefitted from a continued underweight to developed markets financials amid the sovereign debt crisis  stock selection detracted 
the other main source of underperformance was the result of positioning within emerging markets 
specifically  in india  where inflation spikes were most pronounced and interest rate hikes most frequent  our overweight to the market  as well as investments held in banking and infrastructure related stocks  detracted from performance after the country s authorities raised funding costs through tighter monetary policies 
stock selection  as well as an overweight to china  was also a detractor 
russia was also a notable underperformer and our overweight to this market along with stock selection detracted from results 
in particular  positions held within the banking sector were negatively impacted by the full blown banking crisis in nearby western europe 
on a positive note  the underweight position within japan proved beneficial to results 
also contributing to results  was stock selection in korea and taiwan

fair value of aum the valuation policies of the proprietary funds are approved by their boards of directors 
valuation of institutional commingled funds is similar to that of the proprietary funds 
responsibility for the valuation of separate accounts rests with the custodians of our clients accounts 
fair value polices for sub advised accounts are determined by the primary adviser 
fair value measurements are determined using a valuation hierarchy based on the transparency of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
classification within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the valuation hierarchy contains three levels i valuation inputs comprising unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  ii valuation inputs comprising quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured level  and iii valuation inputs that are unobservable and are significant to the fair value measurement level 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
assets for which market quotations are readily available  are valued at fair value on the basis of quotations furnished by a pricing service or provided by securities dealers 
equity investments are generally valued using the last sale price or official closing price taken from the primary market in which each security trades  or if no sales occurred during the day  at the mean of the current quoted bid and asked prices 
fixed income securities are generally valued using prices provided directly by independent third party services or provided directly from one or more broker dealers or market makers 
the pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing  which considers yield or prices with respect to comparable bond quotations from bond dealers or by reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such characteristics as rating  interest rate and maturity date  to determine current value 
assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency are converted into us dollar values 
short term us dollar denominated investments of appropriate credit quality that mature in days or less are valued on the basis of amortized cost 
investments in net asset value based investment vehicles are valued at the net asset value nav of the underlying fund 
artio global investors inc annual report 
table of contents when market quotations or exchange rates are not readily available  or if the primary adviser believes that such market quotations do not accurately reflect fair value  fair values are determined in good faith in accordance with the valuation policies 
for options  swaps and warrants  a fair value price may be determined using an industry accepted modeling tool using inputs  which may include yield data  risk free rate  volatility  contract terms  and others  as applicable 
in addition  we  through our pricing committee  may determine the fair value price based upon multiple factors as set forth in the valuation policies 
these inputs may include prices of similar securities  yield data  the financial condition of the issuer  and other factors  as applicable 
we use both market and income approaches 
the closing prices of domestic or foreign securities may not reflect their market values at the new york market close if an event that materially affects the value of those securities has occurred since the closing prices were established on the domestic or foreign market 
under certain conditions  we fair value foreign securities 
this is generally accomplished by adjusting the closing price for movements in other correlated indices  securities  derivatives  etc 
fair value pricing may cause the value of the security to be different from the closing value on the non us exchange and may affect the calculation of a fund s nav 
certain funds may fair value securities in other situations  for example  when a particular foreign market is closed but the funds are open 
fair value pricing may be applied to both mutual funds and commingled fund assets

fair value techniques were employed as of december   but not as of december  and as a result  a much higher percentage of the overall portfolio was considered to be level as of december  we are not responsible for fair valuing the assets of separate accounts or sub advised accounts  and do not have access to the fair value methodology of the custodians responsible for such valuation
