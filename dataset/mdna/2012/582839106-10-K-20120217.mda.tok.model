significant accounting estimates in presenting our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 

table of contents some of the estimates and assumptions that we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the significant accounting estimates listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
for information on our accounting policies  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
revenue is recognized on the date of receipt by the purchaser 
revenues are reduced at the time of recognition to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience and business trends 
additionally  provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for discounts  wic rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience  updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
we offer sales incentives to customers and consumers through various programs consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances  merchandising funds and consumer coupons 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for these items based on historical experience  updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
wic rebates we participate on a competitive bidding basis in nutrition programs sponsored by states  tribal governments  the commonwealth of puerto rico  and us territories for wic 
under these programs  we reimburse these entities for the difference between our wholesaler list price and the contract price on eligible products 
we account for wic contract rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of wic rebate claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of the wic rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding wic rebates and current contract prices under the wic programs 
we consider levels of inventory in the distribution channel  new wic contracts  terminated wic contracts  changes in existing wic contracts and wic participation  and adjust the accrual periodically throughout the year to reflect actual expense 
wic rebate accruals were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet 
rebates under the wic program reduced revenues by million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales returns we account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns  but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns such as discontinuations and new product introductions 
sales return accruals were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are included in accrued rebates and returns on our balance sheet 
returns reduced sales by million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  including tax rulings  management s assertion that certain foreign earnings and profits are permanently 
table of contents invested abroad and management s estimate of appropriate reserves against uncertain tax positions 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty in tax positions 
the income tax provision prepared in the post split off period reflects a separate return methodology based on the legal structure where we are a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions 
the income tax provision prepared in the period following the ipo but preceding the split off reflects a separate return methodology based on the actual legal entity structure as if we were a separate taxpayer in the respective jurisdictions with certain accommodations pursuant to a tax matters agreement as noted below 
this is in contrast to the pre ipo period in which the income tax provision was prepared on a separate return stand alone methodology reflecting a hypothetical legal entity structure in which we were included in the tax grouping of other bms entities within the respective entity s tax jurisdiction 
the provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable earnings in effect for the years in which those tax attributes are expected to be recovered or paid  and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
the ultimate liability incurred by us may differ from the provision estimates based on a number of factors  including interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long range forecast of future taxable earnings and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made 
changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period  but are not expected to be material to our financial position 
pension and other post retirement benefits our pension plans and post retirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations 
management  in consultation with our actuaries  is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  long term returns on plan assets  retirement  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and post retirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings  projected benefit obligations and future cash funding 
our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and expected long term returns on plan assets 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate assumptions used to value the pension and post retirement benefit obligations reflect the yield to maturity of high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts 
in developing the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors 
we also consider long term historical returns on the asset classes  the investment mix of plan assets  investment manager performance and projected future returns of the asset classes 

table of contents our principal pension plan is the mead johnson company retirement plan in the united states us pension plan  which is a frozen plan and represents approximately of the company s total pension assets and obligations 
the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year are established at the beginning of the plan year and the assumptions used to determine benefit obligation are established as of the balance sheet date 
the key assumptions for the us pension plan were as follows used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended december  discount rate expected long term return on plan assets used to determine benefit obligation as of december  discount rate the obligation for the us pension plan grew by million during  primarily due to the change in the discount rate and the timing of expected payment assumptions 
the change in the discount rate assumption reflected both the assumption used for the timing of expected payments and lower corporate bond rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of our on going business operations 
in addition to our costs for materials  compensation  media  distribution and other purchased services being subject to inflationary pressures  we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates  price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to these risks  we use a variety of contract techniques and financial instruments as described below 
as a policy  we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates 
our primary net foreign currency exposures are the chinese renminbi  the hong kong dollar  the euro  the malaysian ringitt  the mexican peso  the philippine peso  and the canadian dollar 
in addition to these primary exposures  as a global business  we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk in all countries in which we do business whose local reporting currency is not the us dollar 
we use foreign currency contracts to hedge anticipated transactions on certain foreign currencies and designate these derivative instruments as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and then recognized in our statement of earnings when the corresponding hedged item impacts our earnings 
the foreign currency derivatives resulted in losses of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the impact of hedge ineffectiveness on earnings was not significant 
we enter into hedging and other foreign exchange management arrangements to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings to the extent that cost effective derivative financial instruments or other non derivative financial instrument approaches are available 
the intent of gains and losses on hedging transactions is to offset the respective gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
while we attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities  our business will nevertheless remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposures that we will not be able to manage through effective hedging or the use of other financial instruments 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures and the total notional amount of these contracts was million at december   representing a fair value asset of million 
the following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of december  contract amount in millions average contractual exchange rate receive united states dollar pay canadian dollar receive united states dollar pay mexican peso receive united states dollar pay philippine peso 
table of contents all of these derivatives were hedges of anticipated transactions and mature within months 
assuming an unfavorable change in year end exchange rates  the fair value would have changed by million and would have switched to a payable position 
the unfavorable changes would generally have been offset by favorable changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
commodity risk we purchase certain products in the normal course of business  including dairy  agricultural oils  and packaging materials  the costs of which are affected by global commodity changes 
therefore  we are exposed to price volatility related to market conditions outside of our control 
we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to reduce volatility 
generally  these techniques include unit pricing that is based on an average of commodity prices over a contractually defined period of time  timing of purchases  and setting fixed prices with suppliers 
we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partially because of these contract pricing techniques 
as of december   we had no outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
primary exposures include movements in u 
s treasury rates  libor  and commercial paper rates 
the nature and amount of our short term and long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our debt obligations totaled billion
