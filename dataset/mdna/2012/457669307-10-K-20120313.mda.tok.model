item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview insmed incorporated is a development stage biopharmaceutical company with expertise in proprietary  advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery 
we develop innovative inhaled treatments for serious lung infections 
our proprietary liposomal technology is designed specifically for delivery of pharmaceuticals to the lung  and we believe it provides for potential improvements to the conventional inhalation methods of delivering drug to the pulmonary system 
these potential advantages include improvements in efficacy  safety and patient convenience 
our primary focus is on orphan markets with high unmet medical needs  which we believe presents a significant opportunity  as their challenge and complexity best fit our knowledge  know how and expertise 
our strategy is to utilize our patented advanced liposomal technology to develop safe and effective medicines that improve upon standards of care for those orphan respiratory diseases in which patient needs are currently unmet 
our initial primary target indications are pseudomonas aeruginosa hereafter referred to as pseudomonas lung infections in cystic fibrosis cf patients and patients with non tuberculous mycobacterial ntm lung infections 
we completed the merger on december   with transave  a privately held  nj based pharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated and innovative inhaled pharmaceuticals for the site specific treatment of serious lung infections 
our integration with transave was completed in including the relocation of corporate headquarters to monmouth junction  new jersey  and cessation of operations at the richmond  virginia  location as of december  on march   we completed a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock 
unless otherwise noted  the per share amounts in this k give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented 
after giving effect to the merger  former transave stockholders had approximately a equity interest in the combined company on an as converted  fully diluted basis  and legacy insmed incorporated shareholders had a equity interest 
the shares retained by us pursuant to the merger agreement with transave approximately million shares of common stock after giving effect to the conversion of the series b preferred stock and the one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock will be delivered on june  to certain former transave stockholders  subject to reduction for any claims and indemnification payments that are pending 
key components of our statement of operations revenues our revenue consists of secondary revenue streams for iplex expanded access program eap in europe for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  and royalty revenue for the licensing of patent technology for cisplatin lipid complex 
we no longer manufacturer iplex and the cost recovery revenues from our iplex eap in europe ceased in december  when our iplex inventory was fully depleted 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture drug candidates  patent protection costs  amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts primarily depend mainly on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time based fees 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 

index since we began operations in late  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of a number of product candidates 
until the sale of our follow on biologics fob platform on march   our research and development efforts were principally focused on pursuing a dual path strategy involving entry into the fob arena and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
following the business combination with transave  our focus is now principally on our proprietary  advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery 
our initial priority has been to conduct phase studies for arikace in treating cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections and patients with ntm lung infections 
in august the food and drug administration fda placed a clinical hold on our phase clinical trials for arikace in cf patients and ntm patients due to the results of a long term rat carcinogenicity study 
in january following the filing of a complete clinical response to requests for information from the fda  the agency lifted the clinical hold of arikace in the ntm indication noting that the company could initiate a phase clinical trial for patients with ntm under an agreed protocol 
the clinical hold for arikace in the cf indication in the us currently remains in place  and we continue to have dialogue with the fda to attempt to lift the cf clinical hold 
in february the company announced that it would be initiating the arikace ntm trial as a phase trial  as well as the previously planned phase trial for arikace in the cf indication in europe 
also in february  we filed our complete response to the fda clinical hold on the us study of arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas infection 
we will continue discussions with the fda to pursue removal of the clinical hold on arikace in us for the treatment of cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections 
we are moving forward with the arikace clinical development program in cf in europe 
the european study in cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections will be a randomized  phase trial comparing arikace mg  delivered once daily via an optimized  investigational eflow nebulizer system  to tobi inhaled tobramycin solution  which is a marketed inhaled antibiotic that is delivered twice daily 
the company anticipates that the study will be conducted in approximately patients 
the primary endpoint will be change in pulmonary function fev measured after three day on treatment and three day off treatment cycles about six months 
a key secondary endpoint will be time to pulmonary exacerbation 
the study design was previously agreed upon by insmed and the european medicines agency 
eligible patients will have the option to participate in a longer term open label safety study 
the company expects to begin enrolling patients in the phase european clinical study in the second quarter of historically  all of our research and development expenditures related to our proprietary protein platform were interrelated as they are all associated with drugs that modulate igf activity in the human body 
all of these products also share a substantial amount of our common fixed costs such as salaries  facility costs  utilities and maintenance 
given the small portion of research and development expenses that are historically related to products other than iplex we have determined that very limited benefits would be obtained from implementing cost tracking systems that would be necessary to allow for cost information on a product by product basis 
prospectively  all of our currently planned research and development activities are expected to be incurred in the development of arikace 
at present  we expect research of arikace in the cf and ntm indications to represent our main development effort for the remainder of and the foreseeable future 
our clinical trials with our product candidates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that the fda clinical hold for arikace in the cf indication in the us could remain in place or that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
in addition  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and 
index the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may also be subject to delays or rejections based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect or our inability to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our proposed clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates and particularly those that are in the preclinical or early clinical trial stage must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
some of these product candidates may never reach the clinical trial stage of research and development 
in august  we announced that in separate actions the fda had placed a clinical hold on our phase clinical trials for arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections and for patients with ntm lung infections 
the fda informed us that this decision was based on an initial review of the results of a long term rat inhalation carcinogenicity study with arikace 
in august  we announced that the fda had placed the clinical trial programs for cf and ntm on clinical hold due to findings from a two year rat inhalation carcinogenicity study 
as part of the study  rats were given arikace daily by inhalation for almost two years 
two of the rats receiving the highest dose had a single lung tumor 
these rats received arikace doses that are much greater than the doses to be administered to humans 
the relevance of the observed rat tumors to the use of arikace in humans is unknown 
arikace was not associated with changes that may lead to tumors in shorter term studies that we conducted in other animals 
additionally  in a standard series of tests that we performed  arikace was not shown to be genotoxic 
the fda requested additional information on arikace and data from the rat study 
as a result of the clinical hold  we suspended initiation of the arikace phase clinical trial programs  including the recruitment and enrollment of patients 
we provided the requested information to the fda in august and were informed by the fda that  based on its review of the information provided to date  including the rat inhalation carcinogenicity study results  the fda had insufficient information to assess the risks for arikace in cf patients 
in october  the fda notified us that the fda was continuing the clinical hold previously placed on our phase clinical trial for arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections and in patients with ntm lung infections 
regarding the clinical hold for cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections  the fda requested additional information from the us  including that we conduct a nine month dog inhalation toxicity study of arikace to determine if the findings of the rat inhalation carcinogenicity study are also observed in a non rodent model and to propose a cf patient population disease state in which the risk benefit profile of arikace may be more favorable 
we were informed during further dialogue with the fda that if we chose to proceed  the required nine month dog inhalation toxicity study of arikace could be conducted in parallel with the cf phase clinical trials in human subjects 
regarding the clinical hold for patients with ntm lung infections  the fda requested we conduct a phase clinical trial in adult age and older ntm patients to provide proof of concept efficacy and safety data for arikace in ntm patients 
in january  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in patients with ntm lung infections 
we intend to conduct  as requested by the fda  a phase clinical trial in adult ntm patients to provide proof of concept efficacy and safety data for arikace in ntm patients 
we expect to begin enrolling patients in the phase clinical trial in mid we have also begun the work required to allow the company to initiate the nine month dog inhalation toxicity study in the second quarter of in february  we filed our complete response to the fda clinical hold on the us study of arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas infection 
we will continue discussions with the fda to pursue removal of the clinical hold on arikace in us for the treatment of cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections 
as preclinical studies and clinical trials progress  we may determine that collaborative relationships will be necessary to help us further develop or to commercialize our product candidates  but such relationships may be difficult or impossible to arrange 
our projects or intended projects may also be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and may require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding the period in which material net cash inflows from any of these projects is expected to become available  if at all 

index general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  market research and human resource functions  and professional fees for legal  including patent related expenses  consulting  tax and accounting services 
our general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs not included in research and development expenses  insurance  depreciation and general corporate expenses 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase with the continued development and commercialization of our product candidates 
impairment loss impairment loss consists of the write down of the carrying amounts of in process research and development intangible and goodwill assets 
investment income and interest expense investment income consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
short term investments are available for sale and consist primarily of short term municipal bonds  us treasuries and mutual funds 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to convertible notes that were fully repaid in march results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per common share basic and diluted compared with a net loss of million or per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  the net loss attributable to common stockholders in includes the million non cash charge from the impairment adjustment in the third quarter of and the conversion of the series b preferred stock and a non cash charge incurred in the first quarter of for the beneficial conversion feature of the series b preferred stock in the amount of million  which increased net loss available to holders of our common shares and  in turn  increased our loss per common share on a basic and diluted basis by for the year ended december  the charge represents the difference between the conversion price of the series b preferred stock of per share and its carrying value of per share 
the carrying value of the series b preferred stock was based on its fair value at issuance  which was estimated using the common stock price reduced for a lack of marketability between the issuance date and the anticipated date of conversion 
revenue for the year ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared with million for the year ended december  the million reduction was primarily due to year over year decrease of million in cost recovery from our iplex eap in europe  offset with million in license fees from the licensing of patent technology related to insmeds cisplatin lipid complex 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  comprised the following 

index year ended december  increase decrease in thousands clinical development clinical manufacturing regulatory and quality assurance compensation and related research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in is solely attributable to the research and development of arikace program and the manufacturing of supply to support the planned studies 
clinical development expenses increased million in compared with as a result of the planning efforts for the arikace studies and the final payments for an earlier carcinogenicity study associated with the arikace development program 
the million increase in clinical manufacturing expenses from to is attributable to the manufacturing of arikace for use in these studies 
the regulatory and quality assurance increase of million in the year ended compared with is also attributable to the planning associated with the clinical studies  noted above 
higher compensation and related expenses of million are attributable to increased headcount and average per salary headcount associated with the development of arikace 
overall research and development headcount increased from approximately as of december  to as of december  due primarily to the introduction of the arikace development program  which became our lead development program following the merger with transave in december general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase was due primarily to a million charge in the fourth quarter of resulting from the closure of the richmond office following cessation of iplex eap activities in december and to an increase in headcount and average per salary headcount to provide administrative support for the full scale development of arikace 
overall general and administrative headcount increased from approximately as of december  to as of december  in support of the larger business and development program following the merger with transave in december impairment loss impairment loss was million for the year ended december  compared with zero for the same period in the million non cash charge was recorded in the third quarter of reflecting the decline in the fair value of in process research and development  or ipr d intangible and goodwill assets due to the material impact of a clinical hold on our arikace development program 
in january  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in the ntm indication 
in february the company announced that it would be initiating the arikace ntm trial as a phase trial  as well as the previously planned phase trial for arikace in the cf indication in europe 
also in february  we filed our complete response to the fda clinical hold on the us study of arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas infection 
we will continue discussions with the fda to pursue removal of the clinical hold on arikace in us for the treatment of cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections 
as a result of these events  the company believes that the october  valuation of the overall ipr d is reasonable and that no additional impairment of ipr d exists as of december  the company used the multi period excess earnings method mpeem  which is a form of the income approach to derive the fair value of ipr d intangible and goodwill assets 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
a market based valuation approach was not considered given a lack of revenues and profits for the company 
this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with our business plans 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset  and potentially result in different impacts to insmed s results of operations 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 

index investment income and interest expense investment income  net of interest expense  increased to million in from million in the million increase is a result of improved returns on our short term investments totaling million as of december   despite a decrease in overall short term investment balances year over year 
the reduction in interest expense in compared with was entirely due to the elimination of convertible notes  which were fully repaid in march comparison of years ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  was million or per common share basic and diluted  compared with net income of million  or per common share basic and per common share diluted  for the year ended december  the million variance from to was due to a million after tax gain on the sale of our fob assets to merck co  inc  in revenue for the year ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to a year over year decrease of million in cost recovery from our iplex eap in europe  a million reduction in grant revenue related to the receipt of a million grant from the muscular dystrophy association and million in reduced royalties 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and comprised the following year ended december  increase decrease in thousands clinical development clinical manufacturing regulatory and quality assurance compensation and related research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease of million in is attributable to a reduction in manufacturing costs following the sale of insmed s fob assets in march  partially offset by the arikace related research and development expenses incurred in december general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase was due largely to the increased finance  legal and consulting fees related to the business combination with transave on december  
index investment income and interest expense investment income  net of interest expense increased to million in from less than million in the increase is a result of increased cash position from to  and improved returns on our short term investments totaling million as of december  the reduction in interest expense in compared with was due to the elimination of debt discount amortization 
gain on sale of asset  net the gain on sale of asset  net decrease to zero in from million in  represents the gain on sale of the company s fob assets to merck in liquidity and capital resources overview there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point where the us fda approval for sales is received 
we have funded our operations to date through public and private placements of debt and equity securities and the proceeds from the sale of our fob platform to merck 
we will continue to incur losses to the extent we expand our research and development and do not expect material revenues for at least the next several years 
furthermore  revenues from our eap in italy associated with cost recovery terminated in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had total cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and certificate of deposits on hand of million  consisting of million in cash and short term investments and million in a certificate of deposit  as compared with million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and certificate of deposit on hand as of december  the million decrease in total cash and investments was due to the funding of operations  primarily research and development activities 
our working capital was million as of december  even though we believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for  our business strategy in the future may require us to raise additional capital either through licensing  debt or equity sales 
in the future  we may require additional funds for the continued development of our potential product candidates or to pursue the license of complementary technologies 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available when we need them or on favorable terms 
if at any time we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  restrict or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
we could enter into agreement with collaborative partners in order to fund operations through milestone payments  license fees and equity investments 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in related primarily to a net loss of million from higher operating expenses and decreased revenues  partially offset by a non cash charge of million for intangible and goodwill impairment loss 
net cash used in operating activities in related to a net loss of million and a million increase in working capital 
net cash used in operating activities in related primarily to the add back for gain on sale of fob assets of million and an increase in working capital of million offset by net income of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of million from the sale of short term investments partially offset by asset purchases of million 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of million from the sale of short term investments partially offset by million used in the merger 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of million cash received from the sale of fob assets partially offset by million used in the purchase of short term investments 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily a result of capital lease obligation payments 
net cash used in financing activities in was due to the final payment of the convertible notes 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of the conversion of warrants to shares and proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by repayments on convertible notes 

index contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts as set forth below payments due by years in thousands total operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors 
in particular  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policies discussed below are those we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred except for purchased in process research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  cost to develop and manufacture products  patent protection costs and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with third party organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts primarily depend on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales when the goods are delivered and title passes to the customer 
at the time of sale  estimates for sales deductions  including rebates to government agencies  are recorded 
these provisions are provided for in the same period the related product sales are recorded 
following our settlement agreement with tercica  inc now ipsen  inc  and genentech  inc 
now hoffman laroche ltd 
or roche  on march   we ceased to supply iplex to patients and discontinued sales of iplex for short stature disorders as of march  revenue from our eap in italy is recognized when the drugs have been provided to program patients and collectability is assured 
royalties that were paid to tercica and genentech are netted against eap revenue 
license fee income is recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and payments are due 
grant revenue is recognized once payment has been due 

index beneficial conversion charge bcc when issuing debt or equity securities that are convertible into common stock at a discount from the fair value of the common stock at the date the debt or equity financing is committed  we are required to record a beneficial conversion charge bcc in accordance with accounting standards codification asc this bcc is measured as the difference between the fair values of the securities at the time of issue  in this case  and the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date  which was 
the carrying value of the preferred stock was based on its fair value at issuance  which was estimated using the common stock price reduced for a lack of marketability between the issuance date and the anticipated date of conversion 
the bcc is recorded as a non cash charge to earnings 
a bcc of million was recognized at the time of the series b preferred stock conversions and represents a discount on the fair value of our common stock purchased by the note holders 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information about the beneficial conversion feature 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
currently  we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this option valuation model 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized during the year included a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair valued
