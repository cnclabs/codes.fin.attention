our actual results may differ materially 
overview we are focused on the development and commercialization of treatments based on transplanting human neural stem cells and small molecule compounds 
we have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts in the area of neural stem cell research 
we own or exclusively license twenty five issued patents and twenty nine patent pending applications in the field of regenerative medicine and related technologies 
we believe our technology base  in combination with our know how  and collaborative projects with major research institutions  provide a competitive advantage and will facilitate the development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of neurodegenerative conditions and in regenerative repair of acute disease 
regenerative medicine is a young and emerging field 
regenerative medicine is the process of creating living  functional tissues to repair or replace tissue or organ function lost due to age  disease  damage  or congenital defects 
there can be no assurances that our intellectual property portfolio will ultimately produce viable commercialized products and processes 
even if we are able to produce a commercially viable product  there are strong competitors in this field and our products may not be able to successfully compete against them 
all of our research efforts to date are at the pre clinical or clinical stage of development 
we are focused on leveraging our key assets  including our intellectual property  our scientific team and our facilities  to advance our technologies 
in addition  we are pursuing strategic collaborations with members of academia 
research we have devoted substantial resources to our research programs to isolate and develop a series of neural stem cell banks that we believe can serve as a basis for therapeutic products as well as developing our pharmaceutical compounds 
this research is conducted internally  through the use of third party laboratories and consulting companies under our direct supervision  and through collaboration with academic institutes 
operating strategy we employ an outsourcing strategy where we outsource all of our good laboratory practices glp preclinical development activities and good manufacturing practices gmp manufacturing and clinical development activities to contract research organizations cro and contract manufacturing organizations cmo as well as all non critical corporate functions 
manufacturing is also outsourced to organizations with approved facilities and manufacturing practices 
this outsource model allows us to better manage cash on hand and eliminates non vital expenditures 
it also allows for us to operate with relatively fewer employees and lower fixed costs than that required by our competitors 
trends outlook revenue we generated no revenues from the sale of our products for the years ended december   and we are mainly focused on i successfully managing our two sponsored clinical trials  and ii preparing for the initiation of clinical trials relating to chronic spinal cord injury and iii our research with loma linda university 
we are also pursuing pre clinical studies on other central nervous system indications in preparation for additional clinical trials 
we are not focused at this time on generating revenues 
in august of  we were selected as the primary subcontractor for a department of defense dod contract  awarded to loma linda university  to develop its human neural stem cell technology for the treatment of cancerous brain tumors 
the research contract  entitled research to treat cancerous brain tumors with neural stem cells  will be carried out in collaboration with principal investigator john zhang  md  phd  professor of neurosurgery  loma linda university  in loma linda  ca 
we have recognized revenue related to this contract of  for year ended december  as of december   we have billed and unbilled amounts due from loma linda of  management expects complete collection of these amounts and  therefore  has not recognized any allowance for uncollectible amounts as of december  in november  we were awarded three federal grants  totaling  through the patient protection and affordable care act  which supports investments in qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
the funding will help us move our small molecule treatment for depression into the clinic  and advance our ongoing trial to treat als amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with our spinal cord stem cells 
the third grant will go to developing our igf expressing insulin like growth factor neural stem cell therapy product  which could also target als 
in this program  we are focused on engineering our spinal cord neurons to over express molecules of interest  such as igf we had recognized revenue related to these grants of  during the year ended december  as of december   we had received  of these grant funds 
during the first quarter of  all remaining grant funds were received 
these are one time grants 
the company did not generate any revenue for the year ended december  on a long term basis  we anticipate that our revenue will be derived primarily from licensing fees and sales of our cell based therapy and small molecule compounds 
because we are at such an early stage in the clinical trials process  we are not yet able to accurately predict when we will have a product ready for commercialization  if ever 
research development expenses our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing treatments for central nervous system diseases 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers and academic collaborators for research  testing  contract manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the preparation of regulatory applications and reports 
we focus on the development of treatment candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  and use employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product and we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the future  as funding allows 
to the extent that it is practical  we will continue to outsource much of our efforts  including product manufacture  proof of principle and preclinical testing  toxicology  tumorigenicity  dosing rationale  and development of clinical protocol and investigational new drug ind applications 
this approach allows us to use the best expertise available for each task and permits staging new research projects to fit available cash resources 
we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the people s republic of china this subsidiary primarily conducts research with regard to stem cells 
all payments to or investments in this subsidiary have been expensed 
clinical trials stem cells on september   the us food and drug administration fda approved our first ind to begin phase i clinical studies on our treatment for als or lou gehrig s disease 
in october of  we announced that after reviewing safety data from the first patients  the fda granted approval for the trial to advance to transplanting patients in the cervical upper back region for the last six patients in the trial 
to date  we have treated patients 
on august   we filed our second ind for our proposed phase i clinical trials for chronic spinal cord injury 
in october of  we were notified that our ind for spinal cord injury had been placed on clinical hold 
at the time  the fda provided us with specific comments  questions and recommendations for modifications to our trial protocol as contained in our ind application 
we expect to revisit this ind with the fda with a review of the long term human safety data from our als trial as well as some additional long term animal safety data that was generated for the next phase of the als trial 
we anticipate the study  if approved and commenced  will be a multi site study in the united states 
it is still too early to predict when the trial will be approved to move forward 
pharmaceutical compounds in february of  we commenced a phase ia clinical trial of our drug compound  nsi  which is being developed for the treatment of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric indications 
nsi is the lead compound in our neurogenerative small molecule drug platform 
the phase ia trial tested a single oral administration of nsi in healthy volunteers 
in october of  we completed the phase ia portion of the trial 
in december of  we received approval from the fda to commence the phase ib portion of the trial 
the phase ib portion consists of patients with major depressive disorder mdd receiving daily doses for consecutive days 
we plan on commencing the phase ib portion of the trial by the end of the first quarter of it is still too early in the trials to make any determination as to its level of success  if any 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of the general costs  expenses and salaries for the operation and maintenance of our business 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as we progress from a pre clinical to clinical phase of development 
additionally  we have now transitioned to accelerated filer status with the sec and will no longer be able to use the scaled disclosure afforded to smaller reporting companies 
as a result  we have incurred additional costs and expenses with regard to our legal and financial compliance  including compliance with section b of the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that as a result of our outsource model  our g a expenses related to our core business will increase at a slower rate than that of similar companies 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the notes to financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements use of estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  our management has estimated the expected economic life and value of our licensed technology  our net operating loss for tax purposes and our stock option and warrant expenses related to compensation to employees and directors  consultants and investment banks 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with guidance issued by the sec and financial accounting standards board fasb 
historically  our revenue has been derived primarily from providing treated samples for gene expression data from stem cell experiments  from providing services under various grant programs and through the licensing of the use of our intellectual property 
more recently  we have recognized revenue from federal grants through the patient protection and affordable care act  as well as from our services as principal subcontractor pursuant to a department of defense contract with loma linda university 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods and services has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
intangible and long lived assets we follow fasb guidelines related to the accounting for impairment of long lived assets  which established a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during the years ending december   and  no impairment losses were recognized 
fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred an exit price in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
financial assets recorded at fair value in the accompanying financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels  as defined by the new guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the reporting date 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
the fair valued assets we hold that are generally included in this category are money market securities where fair value is based on publicly quoted prices and included in cash equivalents 
level inputs are other than quoted prices included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the reporting date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
we carry no investments classified as level level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities and which reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the reporting date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
our warranty obligations are considered level effective january   we reclassified the fair value of the common stock purchase warrants  which were outstanding at january   and which have exercise price reset and anti liquidation features  from equity to liability status as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since their date of issue 
on january   we reduced additional paid in capital by million and decreased the beginning retained deficit by 
million as a cumulative effect to establish a long term warrant liability of million to recognize the fair value of such warrants 
on february   all remaining common stock purchase options which have an exercise price reset and an anti liquidation feature expired  effectively  eliminating the derivative liability 
in the twelve months ended december    of the common stock purchase warrants were exercised or forfeited 
the expiration of these common stock purchase warrants resulted in a net gain from the change in fair value of  for the twelve months ended december  in the twelve months ended december    of the common stock purchase warrants were exercised or forfeited 
the fair value of the remaining warrants increased  due to a higher stock price  resulting in a loss from the change in fair value of  for the twelve months ended december for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value in the notes to financial statements of this form k 
accounting for warrants we have adopted fasb guidance related to determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
this guidance applies to any freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative  as defined by the fasb  and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain of our warrants were considered to be derivatives and were valued using various assumptions as they are recorded as liabilities 
research and development costs research and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of patents and technology  which are not capitalizable and charged to operations when incurred 
our research and development costs consist mainly of payroll and payroll related expenses  research supplies and costs incurred in connection with specific research grants 
stock based compensation the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with guidance issued by fasb 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed 
we recognized   and  in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively

we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the people s republic of china 
this subsidiary primarily conducts research with regard to stem cells 
our investment to date is considered immaterial 
all payments to and investments in this subsidiary have been expensed and included in r d costs and  to date  these payments total approximately  research and development expenses totaled  in  compared to  in the decrease of  or from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation and consulting expenses

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private placement of our securities  the exercise of investor warrants  and to a lesser degree from grants and research contracts 
we had  in cash at december  on february   the company closed on a registered direct placement of  shares of common stock 
net proceeds are estimated to be  see subsequent events 
the company has signed a term sheet for new private placement for between  and  on terms similar to the february s placement 
we are confident this new placement will close by the end of the second quarter neuralstem is also in negotiations for licensing agreements for both our stem cell and pharmaceutical products 
the licenses cover distinct geographic regions including mexico  japan  europe and worldwide rights 
generally  these agreements provide for significant initial payments to neuralstem for licensing rights and the licensee s paying for the trials required to bring the product to market in their region 
currently  our monthly cash burn rate is approximately  the burn rate is expected to drop to  in the second quarter as we bring our accounts payable current 
we estimate that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to finance our current operations  pre clinical and clinical work for at least months from december  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing after such time 
several factors will affect our ability to raise additional funding  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our common shares and general market conditions

as a result of the exercises  we received gross proceeds of  incurred issuance costs of  ultimately realizing  in net proceeds 
during  we issued an aggregate of  common shares in exchange for  of prepaid consulting and research and development expenses 
no cash was received as a result of these transactions 
call of series b warrants during the first quarter of  we issued an aggregate of  series b warrants in connection with a private placement of our securities 
the series b warrants contained a call provision allowing us to redeem the warrants for 
per warrant share  upon days notice  provided the following two conditions were met a we receive approval of our ind  and b a registration statement covering the resale of the warrant shares shall be effective 
as a result  series b warrant holders exercised their respective warrants in the first quarter  which resulted in us issuing  common shares and receiving gross proceeds in the amount of  future liquidity needs we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and the proceeds from the offering of our securities  exercise of outstanding warrants and grants to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through the sale of our securities and additional research grants 
on october   our shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to million of our securities was declared effective by the sec 
of this amount  we have i sold million of unit pursuant to our february offering  and ii registered up to million of our common shares for sale from time to time pursuant to our november sales agreement 
we anticipate conducting financing in the future based on our shelf registration statement when and if financing opportunities arise 
in november  we filed a prospectus supplement that relates to the issuance and sale of up to  of our common stock  from time to time through a sales agreement with our sales agent stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated 
pursuant to this sales agreement  we may sell common shares directly into the market through our sales agent from time to time 
we have had no sales of our common stock under this sales agreement 
on february   the company closed on a registered direct placement of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  and  warrants  each with an exercise price of per share and exercisable starting six months from the issuance date for a term of five years 
the company received aggregate gross proceeds of  which will be used for general corporate purposes  including ongoing us clinical trials 
net proceeds were approximately the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter were as follows future minimum operating lease payments amount and thereafter total minimum payments  off balance sheet arrangements none item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to some foreign exchange currency risks because we have a subsidiary located in the people s republic of china 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
at present our capitalization of our foreign subsidiary has been minimal and as a result  our foreign exchange risk has been minimal 
notwithstanding  because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations may in the future have an impact on our financial results if we increase the funding to our subsidiary 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is mitigated by the fact that our foreign subsidiaries pay their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currency 
as of december   currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries 
however  in the future if we increase our funding levels  a weakening of the dollar against the foreign exchange used in the home countries of our foreign subsidiaries could increase our cost of providing additional financing to our foreign subsidiaries in the future 
conversely  a strengthening of the dollar would decrease our cost of making additional investments in those subsidiaries 
much of the foreign currency translation gain recognized as of december  is derived from the translation of the subsidiary accounts for consolidation purposes 
credit risk we place most of our cash in united states banks and we invest some of our cash in interest bearing instruments issued by united states banks 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents 
cash equivalents currently consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolios 
our foreign subsidiary deposits their cash in local banks  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the amount at a bank under the national banking insurance laws  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income
