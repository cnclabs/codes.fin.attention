item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
as a result of our production growth and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in  we began separately reporting our transportation and gathering costs as a component of operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
previously reported transportation and gathering costs were reflected as a component of natural gas revenues and have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation 
accordingly  previously reported operating revenues and operating expenses have increased with no impact on previously reported net income 
on january   the board of directors declared a for split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was distributed on january  to shareholders of record as of january  all common stock accounts and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the for split of our common stock 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed

overview cabot oil gas corporation is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the development  exploitation  exploration  production and marketing of natural gas  crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas liquids from its properties in the continental united states 
we also transport  store  gather and produce natural gas for resale 
our exploitation and exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs 
our program is designed to be disciplined and balanced  with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
we evaluate three types of investment alternatives that compete for available capital drilling opportunities  financial opportunities such as debt repayment or repurchase of common stock  and acquisition opportunities 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time that meet our strategic objectives 
at any one time  one or more of these may not be economically feasible 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the commodity markets has remained prevalent in the last few years 
our realized natural gas and crude oil price was per mcf and per bbl  respectively  in in an effort to manage commodity price risk  we opportunistically enter into natural gas and crude oil price swaps and collars 
these financial instruments are a component of our risk management strategy 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas  ngl and crude oil prices and  therefore  we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and 
table of contents commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
see risk factors natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factors our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item a

we drilled gross wells with a success rate of over in compared to gross wells with a success rate of in total capital and exploration expenditures increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program and increases in our drilling programs in the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 
we believe our cash on hand and operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our budgeted capital and exploration spending between and million 
any additional needs are expected to be funded by borrowings from our credit facility 
our strategy will remain consistent with while we consider acquisitions from time to time  we remain focused on pursuing drilling opportunities that provide more predictable results on our 
table of contents accumulated acreage position 
additionally  we intend to maintain spending discipline and manage our balance sheet in an effort to ensure sufficient liquidity  including cash resources and available credit 
for  we have allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures primarily to the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania  the eagle ford oil shale in south texas and  to a lesser extent  the marmaton oil play in oklahoma 
we believe these strategies are appropriate for our portfolio of projects and the current commodity pricing environment and will continue to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information for further details 
financial condition capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sales of properties and other assets during the year 
these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures  in addition to repayments of debt and related interest  contributions to our pension plans and dividends 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
we generate cash from the sale of natural gas and crude oil 
operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for crude oil and natural gas have historically been volatile  including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years 
in addition  fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues 
our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above 
from time to time  our working capital will reflect a surplus  while at other times it will reflect a deficit 
this fluctuation is not unusual 
we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements 
year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities key components impacting net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased by million over this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses 
this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices 
equivalent production volumes increased by for compared to as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production 
average realized natural gas prices decreased by 
table of contents for compared to average realized crude oil prices decreased by compared to the same period 
net cash provided by operating activities in decreased by million over this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in oil and gas revenues and higher operating and interest expense 
average realized natural gas prices decreased by in compared to and average realized crude oil prices increased by over the same period 
equivalent production volumes increased by in compared to primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production 
see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price  production and operating expense movements 
we are unable to predict future commodity prices and  as a result  cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
realized prices may decline in future periods 
investing activities the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures 
we established the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows 
due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise  our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million from to and increased by million from to the decrease from to was due to an increase of million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of million in capital and exploration expenditures 
the increase from to was due to an increase of million in capital and exploration expenditures partially offset by an increase of million of proceeds from the sale of assets 
financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of million  partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of million 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our unsecured credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and million available for future borrowing 
cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to this was primarily due to an increase in borrowings of million  partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of million  an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs by a total of million and a decrease of million in the tax benefit associated with stock based compensation 
in december  we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weighted average interest rate of  consisting of amounts due in january  and in september  we amended and restated our revolving credit facility credit facility to increase the available credit line to million with an accordion feature allowing us to increase the available credit line to billion  if any one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount  and to extend the term to september the available credit line is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks based on our reserve reports and engineering reports and certain other assets and the outstanding principal balance of our senior notes 

table of contents the amended facility provided for an initial billion borrowing base 
effective april   the lenders under our revolving credit facility approved an increase in our borrowing base from billion to billion as part of the annual redetermination under the terms of the credit facility 
our plan to sell certain oil and gas properties located in colorado  utah and wyoming triggered an interim redetermination of our borrowing base and the billion borrowing base was reaffirmed by the lenders effective september  in june  we amended the agreements governing our senior notes to amend the required asset coverage ratio the present value of our proved reserves plus working capital to debt contained in the agreements 
the amendment also changed the ratio for maximum calculated indebtedness to borrowing base as defined in the credit facility agreement 
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity 
our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt 
management believes that  with internally generated cash  existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility  we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position 
capitalization information about our capitalization is as follows december  dollars in thousands debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization cash and cash equivalents includes million and million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million per share on our common stock 
a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding any significant oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations and  when necessary  borrowings under our credit facility 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 

table of contents the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions acquisitions pipeline and gathering other exploration expense total we plan to drill approximately to gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes between and million in total capital and exploration expenditures  down from million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased drilling activity as a result of lower commodity prices 
we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations include long term debt  interest on long term debt  gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments  hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  are set forth in the following table payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt interest on long term debt gas transportation agreements drilling rig commitments hydraulic fracturing services commitments operating leases total contractual obligations interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our million long term debt outstanding at december  interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december  outstanding balance of million will be outstanding through the september maturity date 
a constant interest rate of was assumed  which was the december  weighted average interest rate 
actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for further information on our obligations under gas transportation agreements  drilling rig commitments  hydraulic fracturing services commitments and operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents amounts related to our asset retirement obligations are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures 
the total amount of asset retirement obligations at december  was million  down from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to million of liabilities divested  million in downward revisions of previous estimates and million in liabilities settled  partially offset by million in accretion expense during and million of liabilities incurred 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
our most significant policies are discussed below 
successful efforts method of accounting we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed 
development costs  including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices 
additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller lents  ltd  independent petroleum engineers  who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate 
for more information regarding reserve estimation  including historical reserve revisions  refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item our rate of recording dd a expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves  which are utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
a five percent positive or negative revision to proved reserves throughout the company would decrease or increase the dd a rate by approximately to per mcfe 
revisions in significant fields may individually affect our dd a rate 
it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of in one of our most productive fields would have a to per mcfe impact on our total dd a rate 
these estimated impacts are based on current data  and actual events could require different adjustments to our dd a rate 
in addition  a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment 
due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process  risks associated with the operations of proved 
table of contents producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis  management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future 
carrying value of oil and gas properties we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset 
if the future undiscounted expected cash flows  based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials  as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices 
in the event that commodity prices remain low or continue to decline  there could be a significant revision in the future 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows 
the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience and average property lives 
average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights 
historically  the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years 
the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling 
we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage  especially in exploratory areas 
if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year  the amortization would increase by approximately million or decrease by approximately million  respectively  per year 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program 
natural gas prices have decreased from an average price of per mmbtu in to an average price of per mmbtu in natural gas prices were per mmbtu in december and have continued to decline to per mmbtu in february natural gas prices represent the first of the month henry hub index price per mmbtu 
oil prices have increased from an average price of per barrel in to an average price of per barrel in any further decline in natural gas prices or quantities could result in an impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
asset retirement obligation the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations  pipelines  processing plants and compressors 
we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred  with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs  timing of settlements  inflation rates and discount rate 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement 
table of contents cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life  while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we follow the accounting prescribed in asc under asc  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each quarterly period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective 
the ineffective portion  if any  of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of our derivative instruments are measured based on quotes from the company s counterparties 
such quotes have been derived using valuation models that consider various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil  volatility factors and interest rates  such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable 
these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness 
the company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which it has derivative transactions 
in times where we have net derivative contract liabilities  our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 
employee benefit plans our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
significant assumptions used to determine our projected pension obligation and related costs include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increases  while the assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under a fair value based method of accounting prescribed under asc under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liability classified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
to calculate the fair value  either a binomial or black scholes valuation model may be used 
the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life  volatility and other factors 
stock based compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stock based compensation

other issues and contingencies regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production  natural gas marketing  gathering and transportation  federal regulation of petroleum and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus working capital to debt of to our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of to at december   we were in compliance in all material respects with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 

table of contents operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks 
see risk factors we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item a 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment under asc  property  plant  and equipment 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the related commodity index falls  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions

table of contents natural gas revenues the increase in natural gas revenues of million  excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above  is primarily due to increased production  partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices 
the increased production is primarily due to increased production associated with our marcellus shale drilling program in northeast pennsylvania  partially offset by decreases in production primarily in east and south texas due to normal production declines  the sale of oil and gas properties in colorado  utah and wyoming and a shift from gas to oil projects 
crude oil and condensate revenues the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of million is primarily due to increased production  partially offset by lower realized oil prices 
the increase in production is primarily due to our drilling program in the eagle ford oil shale in south texas  partially offset by lower production in east texas due to decreased activity

direct operations increased million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production 
contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement 
offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance  subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in compared to coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of transportation and gathering increased by million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in  primarily in northeast pennsylvania 
taxes other than income decreased million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in on qualifying wells  lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense 
exploration decreased million due to lower geophysical and geological costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data  partially offset by higher dry hole costs in related to an exploratory dry hole in montana 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million  of which million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower dd a rate of per mcfe for compared to per mcfe for and a million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations 
the increase in depletion and depreciation was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities 

table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by million from to due to the impairment of two south texas fields recognized as a result of continued price declines and limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in there were no impairments in general and administrative increased by million primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares as a result of our higher average stock price for the month of december compared to the average stock price for the month of december higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk is exposure to oil and natural gas prices 
realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for oil and market prices for north american natural gas production 
commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable 
derivative instruments and hedging activity our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to 
table of contents us of increases in prices  but offer protection in the event of price declines 
further  if our counterparties defaulted  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
please read the discussion below as well as note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
periodically  we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks 
all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes 
as of december   we had derivative contracts open natural gas price swap arrangements  six natural gas basis swaps arrangements  three crude oil price swap arrangements and five natural gas collar arrangements 
during  we entered into new derivative contracts covering anticipated natural gas and crude oil production for   and as of december   we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives commodity and derivative type weighted average contract price volume contract period net unrealized gain loss in thousands derivatives designated as hedging instruments natural gas swaps per mcf  mmcf jan

 the amounts set forth under the net unrealized gain loss column in the tables above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december  and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk of million 
nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions  while our non performance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by our bank 
from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap and collar agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these cash flow hedges are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
under the collar agreements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index price falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
we had natural gas price swaps covering bcf  or  of our natural gas production at an average price of per mcf 
we had one crude oil swap covering mbbl  or  of our crude oil production  at an average price of per bbl 
during  crude oil collars covered mbbl  or of total crude oil production  at an average price of per bbl 
we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is 
table of contents generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity 
although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements  the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of non performance by third parties are substantially smaller 
we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to non performance by third parties 
our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america  bank of montreal  bnp paribas  goldman sachs and jpmorgan 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses  which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities

fair market value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturities of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is the estimated cost to acquire the debt  including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate 
the credit spread is our default or repayment risk 
the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixed rate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt 
the fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us 
we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt 
the carrying amounts and fair values of long term debt are as follows december  december  in thousands carrying amount estimated fair value carrying amount estimated fair value long term debt
