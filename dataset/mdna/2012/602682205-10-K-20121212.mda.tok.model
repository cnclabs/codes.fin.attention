our high performance analog products include high density crosspoint switches  optical drivers  equalization and signal conditioning solutions that solve difficult switching  timing and synchronization challenges in next generation optical networking  enterprise storage and broadcast video transmission applications 
our wan communications portfolio helps optimize today s circuit switched networks that furnish much of the internet s underlying long distance infrastructure 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in a variety of network infrastructure equipment  including communications convergence processing triple play access gateways for voice over internet protocol voip and data processing platforms  broadband customer premises equipment cpe gateways and other equipment that carriers use to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers  internet protocol ip private branch exchange pbx equipment and security appliances used in the enterprise and g g wireless small cell base stations in the carrier infrastructure  high performance analog next generation fiber access network equipment including passive optical networking  or pon  systems  switching and signal conditioning products supporting fiber to the premise  optical transport networks otn  storage and server systems and broadcast video  inclusive of routers and other systems that are driving the migration to g high definition hd transmission  and wan communications circuit switched networking equipment that implements asynchronous transfer mode atm and t e and t e communications protocols 
our customers include alcatel lucent sa  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  hitachi ltd  lm ericsson telephone company  mitsubishi electric corporation  nokia siemens networks and zhongxing telecom equipment corp  among others 
we report on a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on september  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on september  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of network infrastructure equipment 
as a result  we rely on network infrastructure oems to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
our customers may need six months or longer to test and evaluate our products and an additional six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we believe our close relationships with leading network infrastructure oems facilitate early adoption of our products during development of their products  enhance our ability to obtain design wins and encourage adoption of our technology by the industry 
we believe our diverse portfolio of semiconductor solutions has us well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant trends in telecommunications spending  including next generation network convergence  voip fiber access deployment in developing and developed markets  g g wireless infrastructure build out  the adoption of higher speed interconnectivity solutions  and the migration of broadcast video to hd 
we market and sell our semiconductor products directly to network infrastructure oems 
we also sell our products indirectly through electronic component distributors and third party electronic manufacturing service providers  who manufacture products incorporating our semiconductor networking solutions for oems 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our net revenue for fiscal our revenue is well diversified globally  with of fiscal net revenue coming from outside of the americas 
we believe a portion of the products we sell to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region is ultimately shipped to end markets in the americas and europe 
we believe we are well situated in china  where fiber deployments are being rolled out by the country s major telecommunications carriers 
through our oem customers  we are shipping into the fiber to the building fttb deployments of china telecom  china unicom and china mobile 
approximately of our net revenue for fiscal was derived from customers in china 
we have significant research  development  engineering and product design capabilities 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to make  substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the formulation of industry standards 
we spent approximately million on research and development in fiscal we seek to maximize our return on our research and development spending by focusing our research and development investment in what we believe are key growth markets  including voip and other high bandwidth multiservice access applications  high performance analog applications such as optical networking and broadcast video transmission  and wireless infrastructure solutions for base station processing 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we may periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our intellectual property 
we are dependent upon third parties for the development  manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products 
our ability to bring new products to market  to fulfill orders and to achieve long term revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to obtain sufficient external manufacturing capacity  including wafer fabrication capacity 
periods of upturn in the semiconductor industry may be characterized by rapid increases in demand and a shortage of capacity for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
in such periods  we may experience longer lead times or indeterminate delivery schedules  which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
during periods of capacity shortages for manufacturing  assembly and testing services  our primary foundries and other suppliers may devote their limited capacity to fulfill the requirements of their other customers that are larger than we are  or who have superior contractual rights to enforce manufacture of their products  including to the exclusion of producing our products 
the foundries and other suppliers on whom we rely may experience financial difficulties or suffer disruptions in their operations due to causes beyond our control  including deteriorations in general economic conditions  labor strikes  work stoppages  electrical power outages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
we may also incur increased manufacturing costs  including costs of finding acceptable alternative foundries or assembly and test service providers 
in order to achieve sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenue 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating cost structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  when necessary 
our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we believe the market for network infrastructure equipment in general  and for communications semiconductors in particular  offers attractive long term growth prospects due to increasing demand for network capacity  the continued upgrading and expansion of existing networks and the build out of telecommunication networks in developing countries 
however  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in addition  there has been an increasing trend toward industry consolidation  particularly among major network equipment and telecommunications companies 
consolidation in the industry has generally led to pricing pressure and loss of market share 
these factors have caused substantial fluctuations in our revenue and our results of operations in the past  and we may experience cyclical fluctuations in our business in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to inventories  stock based compensation  revenue recognition  income taxes  business combinations  goodwill and other long lived assets and impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand generally over months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
our products are used by oems that have designed our products into network infrastructure equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
in the event that quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally are unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
we base our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories  and the amounts of any write downs  on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
for the majority of our awards  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we classify compensation expense related to these awards in our consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the recipient reports 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from direct product sales  sales to distributors  maintenance contracts  development agreements and the sale and license of intellectual property 
we recognize revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
we recognize revenue on products shipped directly to customers at the time the products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors based on the rights granted to these distributors in our distribution agreements 
we have certain distributors who have been granted return rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers  the magnitude of which is not known at the time products are shipped to the distributor 
the return rights granted to these distributors consist of limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of the products in their inventory twice a year  as well as certain product return rights if the applicable distribution agreement is terminated 
these distributors also receive price concessions because they resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributor s resale is priced at a discount from the distributor s invoice price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of the distributor s original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on sales to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
under these agreements  we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor  at which time our final net sales price is fixed and the distributor s right to return the products expires 
at the time of shipment to these distributors i we record a trade receivable at the invoiced selling price because there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  ii we relieve inventory for the carrying value of products shipped because legal title has passed to the distributor  and iii we record deferred revenue and deferred cost of inventory under the deferred income on sales to distributors caption in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the deferred cost of inventory component of this account for possible impairment by considering potential obsolescence of products that might be returned to us and by considering the potential of resale prices of these products being below our cost 
by reviewing deferred inventory costs in the manner discussed above  we ensure that any portion of deferred inventory costs that are not recoverable from future contractual revenue are charged to cost of sales as an expense 
deferred income on sales to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on sales to distributors  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods is typically less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
in recent years  such concessions have exceeded of list price on average 
for detail of this account balance  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from other distributors at the time of shipment and when title and risk of loss transfer to the distributor  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and when the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
these distributors may also be given business terms to return a portion of inventory  however they do not receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers 
at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed or determinable and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated and accrued 
our products are often integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements through our maintenance contracts for many of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for sales of products where software is not included or is incidental to the equipment  we apply the provisions of asc  revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
revenue from the sale and license of intellectual property is recognized when the above mentioned four revenue recognition criteria are met 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and customer acceptance has been received and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions we have provided a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state deferred tax assets 
if sufficient positive evidence of our ability to generate future u 
s federal and or state taxable income becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we follow asc  income taxes  for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  the new interpretations provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
to the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  such excess is allocated to goodwill 
we determine the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information  including discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates made by management 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  during the measurement period of up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information as to facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date impacting asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred 
goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the acquired net tangible and intangible assets 
other long lived assets include the acquired intangible assets of developed technology  trademarks and trade names  customer relationships and in process research and development  or ipr d 
we currently amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used or  if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  using a straight line amortization method 
we capitalize ipr d projects acquired as part of a business combination 
on completion of each project  ipr d assets will be reclassified to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of the tenth month of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
we have four reporting units wireless  voip  high performance analog hpa and wan 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using the income approach level and level inputs and market approach level inputs to valuation  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  will be recognized as an impairment loss 
the goodwill is allocated to the wireless reporting unit 
for purposes of step one analyses for our annual goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the wireless reporting unit was determined based on the weighted fair value using market and income approach 
determining the fair value of our reporting units is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value under the income approach include the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
the market approach utilized valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from comparable companies in the industry 
the result of the impairment analysis showed that the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
we continue to monitor the impact of recent market and economic events to determine if impairment indicators exist 
should a triggering event occur in  we will perform an interim impairment test 
during development  ipr d is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value to its carrying amount 
we determine the fair value using the income approach level and level inputs 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
once an ipr d project is complete  it becomes a definite long lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment in accordance with our policy for the impairment of other long lived assets 
we continually monitor events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
an indication of impairment exists when the asset carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
when indicators of impairment exist for a long lived asset  the amount of impairment loss is the excess of net book value over fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of certain long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  we early adopted and retrospectively applied the provisions of this guidance 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted these provisions during the second quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance intended to simplify the test for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining if performing a quantitative test is necessary 
the amendments do not change the measurement of impairment losses 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenue the following table summarizes net revenue by product line for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue september  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages communications convergence processing high performance analog wan communications total net product revenue intellectual property net revenue the decrease in our net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower sales volumes for our communications convergence processing products  wan communications products and intellectual property revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in demand for our high performance analog products 
net revenue from our communications convergence processing products decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to a decrease in net revenue from a slowdown in carrier capital expenditures in g equipment  which resulted in fewer shipments of wireless media gateways used in terminating calls between the public telephone switched networks ptsn and mobile networks 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in shipments of products for small cell base stations of million resulting from our acquisition of picochip  which closed on february  net revenue from high performance analog products increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to increased demand for optical physical media devices  as well as an increase in demand for crosspoint switches 
net revenue from wan communications products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a slowdown in demand at several large customers  particularly in legacy atm based systems 
wan communications products represent a legacy business for us  as we have shifted almost all of our research and development investment into our growth businesses of cpe  wireless and high performance analog products 
net revenue from intellectual property licensing and sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the timing of intellectual property sales 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we may periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our patents 
the following table summarizes net revenue by product line for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages communications convergence processing high performance analog wan communications total net product revenue intellectual property net revenue the decrease in our net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal mainly reflects lower sales volumes in our wan communications products and lower revenue from the sale of intellectual property 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in our communications convergence processing products and our high performance analog products 
net revenue from our wan communications products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a slowdown in demand at several large customers  particularly in atm based systems 
wan communications products represent a legacy business for us  as we have shifted almost all of our research and development investment into our two growth businesses of communications convergence processing products and high performance analog products 
net revenue from intellectual property licensing and sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decline in intellectual property sales in fiscal net revenue from our communications convergence processing products increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to an increase in shipments of cpe products  which are used in broadband cpe gateways and other equipment that service providers are deploying in order to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers 
within communications convergence processing  we also experienced an increase in shipments for fttb deployments  particularly to customers in china 
net revenue from high performance analog products increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased demand for physical media devices  which are primarily used in equipment for fiber to the premise deployments 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenue less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties  including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd 
tsmc  amkor technology  inc  unisem  inc  jazz semiconductor  inc and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc ase  for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
cost of goods sold primarily consisted of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalty and other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  asset impairments  amortization of the cost of mask sets purchased  and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
the following table presents gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue september  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages gross margin our gross margin for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a million  or  decrease in product revenue  and a million decrease in intellectual property revenue 
the decrease in gross margin was also due to million of asset impairments recorded in cost of goods sold  which related to the impairment of an intellectual property license and a photomask during the third quarter of fiscal  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  and million from the write up to fair value of acquired inventory and amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the picochip acquisition 
the decrease in our gross margin as a percent of net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was driven primarily by a change in product mix  as well as a decrease in intellectual property revenue  which had little associated cost  and the asset impairments

the following table presents interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages interest expense the decline in our interest expense charge in fiscal compared to fiscal corresponded to the decrease in our overall debt balance during that period 
in november  we repaid the remaining million due under our convertible senior notes  thereby decreasing our interest expense related to these notes for the remainder of fiscal as a result of adopting asc on october   we have separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our convertible senior notes  retrospectively  which resulted in recognizing interest expense based on the entity s borrowing rate at the time of issuance for similar unsecured senior debt without an equity conversion feature 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of asc other income  net other income  net  principally consisted of the change in fair value of contingent consideration  income from reimbursable foreign r d incentives  interest income  foreign exchange gains and losses and other non operating gains and losses 
the following table presents other income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue september  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages other income  net the increase in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected a gain of million related to the revaluation of our contingent consideration and an increase of  in net foreign exchange gains 
the increase to other income  net  was partially offset by a  decrease in reimbursable foreign research and development credits 
year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages other income  net the increase in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflected million in reimbursable foreign research and development credits recorded in other income in fiscal this increase in other income was partially offset by approximately  in net foreign exchange losses recorded in fiscal compared to  in net foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal provision for income taxes the following tables present provision for income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue september  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal and principally consisted of income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal principally consisted of income tax due on operating income generated in the us a substantial portion of this operating income was offset by previously generated net operating losses  thereby reducing the effective tax rate on us earnings 
as of september   we had a valuation allowance of million against our us federal and state deferred tax assets which reduces their carrying value to zero because we continue to believe that it is unlikely that we will realize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of future income tax payments 
we have considered both positive and negative evidence in reaching this determination and placed considerable weight upon the cumulative losses over the past three year period 
as of september   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including the net operating loss carryforwards we retained in the distribution 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to retain or fully utilize such net operating loss carryforwards  or that such net operating loss carryforwards will not be significantly limited in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our existing cash and cash equivalent balance 
in order to achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses  increase our gross margin and or increase revenue 
we have recently completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating expense structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  if necessary 
in addition  we may commit to additional restructurings to help implement strategic initiatives 
these restructurings and other cost saving measures alone may not allow us to achieve profitability 
our ability to maintain  or increase  current revenue levels to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers and enterprises  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions  and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we may be unable to increase current revenue levels or sustain past and future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not be able to achieve profitability 
on february   we completed the acquisition of picochip 
we paid net cash of approximately million less certain deductions and issued an aggregate of million shares of our authorized common stock  par value per share  to the stockholders of picochip 
we have also become obligated to make an additional earnout payment  which was contingent on the achievement of a milestone relating to certain product developments 
as of september   the estimated amount payable on this earnout was million 
earnout payments will be paid in the first quarter of calendar  and we may make earnout payments in the form of cash  stock or any combination thereof 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations and our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations  anticipated capital expenditures  working capital and other financing requirements  including interest payments on debt obligations  for at least the next months 
we have  of principal payments due in march and in june on our term loan with svb and million of principal payments due in august on our convertible notes 
we have no other principal payments on debt obligations for the next months 
we may acquire our debt securities through privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchange offers for new debt or other securities  redemptions or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine appropriate 
we will need to continue a focused program of capital expenditures to meet our research and development and corporate requirements 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
in order to fund capital expenditures  increase our working capital  re pay debt or complete any acquisitions  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we may also need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels 
however  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  particularly in light of recent economic conditions in the capital markets

our net days sales outstanding increased from days in the fourth quarter of fiscal to days in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  restructuring related payments made during fiscal were significantly lower than payments made in fiscal partially offsetting the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in restructuring related payments was an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  due to our fiscal management bonus accrual  as well as the timing of vendor payments

financing activities provided cash for fiscal due primarily to three significant items 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we used cash when we paid million to retire the remaining principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which matured in november offsetting this use of cash was million in net proceeds we received from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock in an offering that was completed in the second quarter of fiscal we also generated cash from financing activities of million in proceeds received in conjunction with the exercise of stock options in fiscal revolving credit facilities and long term debt convertible senior notes on june   we sold million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due for net proceeds of million

the effective interest rate was for fiscal the interest expense for the million convertible debt for fiscal was  the convertible notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
this is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock

as of september   no events of default have occurred 
for financial accounting purposes  the requirements for us to make additional interest payments in the event of early redemption by us and to make additional interest payments in the event that we do not timely file certain periodic reports with the sec are embedded derivatives 
as of september   the fair value of these embedded derivatives has been estimated and is not significant

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
at september   our debt consisted of a revolving credit facility  a term loan facility and short term and long term convertible senior notes 
our revolving credit facility and term loan facility carry variable interest rates and the interest payments are therefore subject to interest rate risk  while the principal is not subject to interest rate risk 
we have the option to choose  with a few exceptions  whether the term loan facility and revolving credit facility bear interest based on a base rate  which is the prime rate published in the wall street journal  or a libor rate  which has a floor of 
if the prime rate or libor rate changed by  thereby changing our effective borrowing rate by the same amount  cash interest expense related to the credit facility and term loan facility would change by approximately  annually

consequently  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to any significant interest rate risk relating to our convertible senior notes 
the fair value of the debt could increase or decrease if interest rates decreases or increase  respectively  and that could impact our ability and cost to negotiate a settlement of such notes prior to maturity 
foreign exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we face foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  our foreign exchange risks are not hedged  however  from time to time  we may utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
these hedging transactions are intended to offset the gains and losses we experience on foreign currency transactions with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign exchange gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we held no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at september   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
