executive summary general tredegar is primarily a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of all of our businesses are provided on pages sales were million in compared to million in income from continuing operations was million cents per diluted share in  compared with million cents per diluted share in losses associated with plant shutdowns  assets impairments and restructurings and gains and losses on the sale of assets  gains or losses on investments accounted for under the fair value method and other items are described in results of continuing operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page film products on october   tac holdings  llc the buyer and tredegar film products corporation  which are indirect and direct  respectively  wholly owned subsidiaries of tredegar  entered into a membership interest purchase agreement the purchase agreement with gaucho holdings  bv the seller  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of vision capital partners vii lp 
on october   under the terms of the purchase agreement  the buyer acquired from the seller of the outstanding equity interests of terphane holdings llc terphane for approximately million subject to the resolution of certain post closing adjustments as provided in the purchase agreement 
terphane is headquartered in s o paulo  brazil and operates manufacturing facilities in cabo de santo agostinho  brazil and bloomfield  new york 
it is a market leading producer of thin polyester films in latin america with a growing presence in strategic niches in the united states us 
polyester films have specialized properties  such as heat resistance and barrier protection  that make them uniquely suited for the fast growing flexible packaging market 
we expect that the acquisition of terphane will allow us to extend our product offerings into adjacent specialty films markets and to expand in latin america 

table of contents a summary of operating results for film products is provided below in thousands  except percentages year ended december favorable unfavorable change sales volume pounds net sales operating profit from ongoing operations net sales sales less freight increased in compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of terphane and an increase in average selling prices from the pass through of higher average resin prices  partially offset by lower volume in surface protection materials and personal care films 
the slowdown in end user demand for large sized lcd panels  particularly in the high end segment  has negatively impacted the volumes of our surface protection materials 
in addition  reduced consumer demand for applications that utilize our premium personal care films has also contributed to the reduction in sales volume 
terphane generated net sales of million subsequent to its acquisition 
operating profit from ongoing operations decreased in compared to due to the lower sales volumes in surface protection materials and personal care films 
the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by a reduction in the unfavorable impact of the lag in the pass through of higher resin costs  additional operating profits generated by the acquisition of terphane  cost reduction efforts and improved manufacturing efficiencies in  and favorable changes in the us dollar value of currencies for operations outside the us film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days 
the estimated impact of the lag in the pass through of changes in average resin costs was a negative million in and a negative million in the estimated favorable impact from us dollar value currencies for operations outside the us was million in compared with terphane had operating profit of million from the acquisition date through december   which included million of one time reimbursements for customs duties 
sales volumes and operating profits in film products are expected to be unfavorably impacted by lower end user demand and competitive pricing pressures for some of our more mature product lines 
we expect to incur some margin compression  which may not fully be offset by costs saving measures and manufacturing efficiency initiatives as we enter into new multi year supply agreements for these mature products 
capital expenditures in film products were million in compared to million in  and are estimated to be approximately million in  which includes approximately million in capital expenditures for a project that will expand our capacity at our newly acquired manufacturing facility in brazil 
the multi year project will increase capacity that primarily serves specialized polyester films customers in latin america 
depreciation expense was million in compared to million in  and is estimated to be approximately million in aluminum extrusions a summary of operating results for aluminum extrusions is provided below in thousands  except percentages year ended december favorable unfavorable change sales volume pounds net sales operating profit loss from ongoing operations the increase in net sales was due to higher volumes and an increase in average selling prices driven by higher average aluminum costs 
sales volume increased in compared to as we developed new customer opportunities and we were able to support key customers who continue to demonstrate strength in a difficult business environment 
the improvement in results from ongoing operations in reflects higher volumes 

table of contents aluminum extrusions continues to concentrate its efforts on controlling costs and effectively managing working capital  as the timing of a meaningful recovery in the us construction market remains uncertain 
in february  we announced that aluminum extrusions would be closing its manufacturing facility in kentland  indiana 
the plant  which employs people and whose core market was residential construction  is scheduled to close by september  we estimate that charges incurred related to the shutdown will be approximately million  and include accelerated depreciation on property  plant and equipment of approximately million  severance charges of approximately million and other shutdown related costs of approximately million 
other shutdown related costs are primarily comprised of equipment transfers and plant shutdown charges 
most of these charges  which include cash expenditures of approximately million  are expected to be recognized over the next months 
capital expenditures in aluminum extrusions were million in  compared to million in  and are estimated to be approximately million in depreciation expense was million in  compared to million in  and is estimated to be approximately million in higher depreciation expense in is primarily related to approximately million in accelerated depreciation on property and equipment at the kentland  indiana manufacturing facility 
other the other segment is comprised of the start up operations of bright view technologies bright view and falling springs  llc falling springs 
bright view is a developer and producer of high value microstructure based optical films for the led light emitting diode and fluorescent lighting markets 
the operations of bright view were incorporated into film products effective january  to better leverage efforts to produce films for new market segments 
falling springs develops  owns and operates multiple mitigation banks 
through the establishment of perpetual easements to restore  enhance and preserve wetlands  streams or other protected environmental resources  these mitigation banks create saleable credits that are used by the purchaser of credits to offset the negative environmental impacts from private and public development projects 
net sales for this segment can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as bright view is a late stage development company and falling springs revenue can vary based upon the timing of development projects within its markets 
operating losses from ongoing operations were million in and million in although these companies are in their relative infancy and currently are incurring operating losses  we are encouraged by their progress in developing new products and sustainable business models 
corporate expenses  interest and income taxes pension expense was million in  an unfavorable change of million from pension expense recognized in most of the change is reflected in corporate expenses  net in the segment operating profit table presented on page we contributed approximately million to our pension plans in minimum required contributions to our pension plans in are expected to be million as interest rates and plan asset investment returns declined 
pension expense in is estimated at million 
corporate expenses  net decreased in in comparison to primarily due to lower performance based incentives  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of pension expense noted above 
the effective tax rate used to compute income taxes from continuing operations was in compared with in the change in the effective tax rate for versus was due to numerous factors as shown in the effective income tax rate reconciliation provided in note beginning on page our net debt balance total debt of million in excess of cash and cash equivalents of million at december  was million  compared to a net cash balance cash and cash equivalents of million in excess of total debt of million at december  of million 
in october  we borrowed million under our revolving credit agreement and used approximately million of cash on hand net of cash received to fund the acquisition of terphane 
net cash and net debt are not intended to represent debt or cash as 
table of contents defined by generally accepted accounting principles  but are utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation and we believe that investors also may find net debt or cash helpful for the same purposes 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december st of each year 
our reporting units include  but are not limited to  polyethylene and polypropylene films and pet films which comprise film products as well as aluminum extrusions 
as of december   the only reporting units carrying a goodwill balance were polyethylene and polypropylene films and pet films 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and long lived identifiable assets  we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and comparative enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples 
these calculations require us to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if an impairment exists 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed as to the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets  we have recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations of million in  million in and million in investment accounted for under the fair value method we have invested million in a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives are similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds generally use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   our ownership interest was approximately on a fully diluted basis 
we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the dates of our investments august  and december   we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to the last round of financing  and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates drop to level inputs since there is no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  the investee currently has no product sales 
accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or any other significant financial transaction  fair value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of development and commercialization milestone payments  sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 

table of contents at december  and  the fair value of our investment the carrying value included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet was million and million  respectively 
the fair market valuation of our interest in the specialty pharmaceutical company is sensitive to changes in the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flow projections for the high degree of risk associated with meeting development and commercialization milestones as anticipated 
at december   the effect of a basis point change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have increased or decreased the fair value of our interest in the specialty pharmaceutical company by approximately million 
any future changes in the estimated fair value of our ownership interest will likely be attributed to a new round of financing  a merger or initial public offering or adjustments to the timing or magnitude of cash flows associated with development and commercialization milestones 
adjustments to the estimated fair value of our investment will be made in the period upon which such changes can be quantified 
pension benefits we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have resulted in varying amounts of net pension income or expense  as developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income or expense recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
the weighted average discount rate utilized was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
based on plan changes announced in  pay for active participants of the plan was frozen as of december  a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
the total return on our plan assets  which is primarily affected by the change in fair value of plan assets and current year payments to participants  decreased in  and increased and in and  respectively 
the negative return of on pension assets in was primarily due to the drop in global stock prices 
our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is estimated by asset class and generally based on inflation adjusted historical returns  volatilities  risk premiums and managed asset premiums  were in to and from to we anticipate that our expected long term return on plan assets will be for see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
tax payments resulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority on uncertain tax positions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively million  million and million  respectively  net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us  various states  and jurisdictions outside the us generally  except for refund claims and amended returns  tredegar is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december  and  we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively

recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board completed their joint project on fair value measurement and issued their respective final standards 
the amended fasb guidance results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
many of the changes to us gaap clarified existing guidance 
there were some changes to u 
s gaap  such as the change in the valuation premise and the application of premiums and discounts as well as new disclosure requirements 
the new disclosure requirements include enhanced disclosure for the valuation of all level fair value measurements  disclosure of transfers between level and level fair value measurements on a gross basis  including reasons for those transfers  disclosure about the highest and best use of non financial assets  and disclosure of the fair value hierarchy categorization for those assets whose fair value is disclosed but not recognized on the balance sheet 
the new fasb guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  early application is not permitted 
we intend to comply with the new reporting requirements beginning with the first quarter of  and the new requirements are not expected to materially expand our current financial statement footnote disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that will require entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present the elements of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity will be eliminated 
in december  the fasb issued a final standard to defer the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
companies will still be required to adopt the other requirements contained in the new standard on comprehensive income 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   however early application is permitted 
we intend to comply with the new reporting requirements beginning with the first quarter of in september  the fasb issued guidance that changes the goodwill impairment guidance in order to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual impairment test 
the changes will provide entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test will be required 
otherwise  no further testing will be required 
the revised guidance will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we intend to comply with the new reporting requirements in and do not anticipate that this new guidance will have a material effect on future goodwill impairment testing

business combination accounting principles under us gaap require that we adjust the inventory acquired in the acquisition of terphane to fair value at the date of acquisition 
in particular  finished goods inventory acquired was adjusted to reflect the cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin 
the acquired inventory was sold in the fourth quarter of we believe that the adjustment included in cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of should be removed by investors as a means to determine profit and margins from ongoing operations  which reflect the operating trends of the acquired business

from time to time  we enter into transactions with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the transaction  or the sellers or third parties involved in the transaction agree to indemnify us  for certain liabilities or risks related to the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of goods or services that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification would be subject to an assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances under the terms of the applicable agreement 
further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and material

changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers

the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products is shown in the chart below 
logo resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days see the executive summary on page and the business segment review on page for more information 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note beginning on page for more information

we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the continuing monthly operating profit for our us operations in aluminum extrusions 
in september  we announced an energy surcharge for our aluminum extrusions business in the us to be applied when the previous quarter s nymex natural gas average settlement price is in excess of per mmbtu
