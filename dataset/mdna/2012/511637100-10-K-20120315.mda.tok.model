critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company and lakeland conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates implicit in these financial statements are as follows 
for additional accounting policies and detail  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense 
loan principal considered to be uncollectible by management is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the loan and lease portfolio  
table of contents overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans and leases  and current economic conditions which may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
the evaluation also analyzes historical losses by loan and lease category  and considers the resulting loss rates when determining the reserves on current loan and lease total amounts 
loss estimates for specified problem loans and leases are also detailed 
all of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses may be subject to change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan and lease losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
loans and leases are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that lakeland will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled principal and interest payments 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
regardless of the measurement method  a creditor must measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral when the creditor determines that foreclosure is probable 
most of lakeland s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
lakeland groups impaired commercial loans under  into a homogeneous pool and collectively evaluates them 
interest received on impaired loans and leases may be recorded as interest income 
however  if management is not reasonably certain that an impaired loan and lease will be repaid in full  or if a specific time frame to resolve full collection cannot yet be reasonably determined  all payments received are recorded as reductions of principal 
fair value measurements and fair value of financial instruments 
fair values of financial instruments are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost  and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
often  the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  core deposit intangible  deferred loan costs  deferred compensation and valuation reserves on leases held for sale 
the company evaluates tax positions that may be uncertain using a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
additional information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions is set forth in note to the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein 

table of contents goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of november or when circumstances indicate a potential for impairment at the reporting unit level 
us gaap requires at least an annual review of the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill in order to determine if it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if this qualitative test determines it is unlikely less than probability the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value  then the company does not have to perform a step one impairment test 
if the probability is greater than  a step one goodwill impairment test is required 
the step one test compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company has determined that it has one reporting unit  community banking 
the company performed a qualitative analysis to determine whether the weight of evidence  the significance of all identified events and circumstances indicated a greater than likelihood existed that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value and if a step one test would be required 
the company identified nine qualitative assessments that are relative to the banking industry and to the company 
these factors included macroeconomic factors  banking industry conditions  banking merger and acquisition trends  lakeland s historical performance  the company s stock price  the expected performance of lakeland  the change of control premium of the company versus its peers and other miscellaneous factors 
after reviewing and weighting these factors  the company  as well as a third party adviser  determined as of november  that there was a less than probability that the fair value of the company was less than its carrying amount 
therefore  no step one test was required

table of contents net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
the company s net interest income is determined by i the volume of interest earning assets that it holds and the yields that it earns on those assets  and ii the volume of interest bearing liabilities that it has assumed and the rates that it pays on those liabilities 
net interest income increases when the company can use noninterest bearing deposits to fund or support interest earning assets 
net interest income for on a tax equivalent basis was million  representing a decrease of million  or  from the million earned in the decrease in net interest income primarily resulted from a basis point decrease in the yield on interest earning assets  which was partially offset by a basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread as a result declined nine basis points to 
although the net interest spread declined  the decline was mitigated by an increase in income earned on free funds interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities resulting from an increase in average non interest bearing deposits of million 
the components of net interest income will be discussed in greater detail below

residential mortgage loans are placed on non accrual status at the time principal and interest have been in default for a period of days or more  except where there exists sufficient collateral to cover the defaulted principal and interest payments  and management s knowledge of the specific circumstances warrant continued accrual 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and interest payments are four months in arrears unless the obligations are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest thereafter on such charged off consumer loans is taken into income when received only after full recovery of principal 
as a general rule  a non accrual asset may be restored to accrual status when none of its principal or interest is due and unpaid  satisfactory payments have been received for a sustained period usually six months  or when it otherwise becomes well secured and in the process of collection

table of contents the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to loans and leases outstanding reflects management s evaluation of the underlying credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the periodic provisioning for estimated losses included in the consolidated financial statements is the responsibility of management and the board of directors 
the evaluation process is undertaken on a quarterly basis 
methodology employed for assessing the adequacy of the allowance consists of the following criteria the establishment of reserve amounts for all specifically identified classified loans and leases that have been designated as requiring attention by the company or the company s external loan review consultants 
the establishment of reserves for pools of homogeneous types of loans and leases not subject to specific review  including impaired commercial loans under  leases  family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
the establishment of reserve amounts for the non classified loans and leases in each portfolio based upon the historical average loss experience for these portfolios and management s evaluation of key factors 
consideration is given to the results of ongoing credit quality monitoring processes  the adequacy and expertise of the company s lending staff  underwriting policies  loss histories  delinquency trends  and the cyclical nature of economic and business conditions 
since many of the company s loans depend on the sufficiency of collateral as a secondary source of repayment  any adverse trend in the real estate markets could affect underlying values available to protect the company from loss 
a loan is reviewed for charge off when it is placed on non accrual status with a resulting charge off if the loan is not secured by collateral having sufficient liquidation value to repay the loan and all accrued interest and the loan is not in the process of collection 
charge offs are recommended by the chief credit officer and approved by the board on a monthly basis 
while non performing loans and leases increased from million on december  to million on december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was of total loans and leases on december  compared to of total loans and leases on december  the increase in non accrual loans  as discussed above  was in commercial loans secured by real estate  commercial and industrial loans and real estate construction loans 
non accrual leases declined from to by million due to the favorable resolution of several non performing leases 
management believes  based on appraisals and estimated selling costs  that the majority of these loans are well secured and reserves on these loans are adequate 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all accompanying factors related to the loan and lease portfolio  management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate at december  the preceding statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of

lakeland can also generate funds by utilizing long term debt or securities sold under agreements to repurchase that would be collateralized by security or mortgage collateral 
at times the market values of securities collateralizing our securities sold under agreements to repurchase may decline due to changes in interest rates and may necessitate our lenders to issue a margin call which requires the company to pledge additional collateral to meet that margin call

management and the board monitor the company s liquidity through the asset liability committee  which monitors the company s compliance with certain regulatory ratios and other various liquidity guidelines 
the company s management believes that its current level of liquidity is sufficient to meet its current and anticipated operational needs  including current loan commitments  deposit maturities and other obligations 
this constitutes a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from anticipated results due to a variety of factors  including uncertainties relating to general economic conditions  unanticipated decreases in deposits  changes in or failure to comply with governmental regulations  and uncertainties relating to the analysis of the company s assessment of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities and the extent to which market factors indicate that a financial institution such as lakeland should match such assets and liabilities

interest rate risk closely related to the concept of liquidity is the concept of interest rate sensitivity ie  the extent to which assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a financial institution  the company s potential interest rate volatility is a primary component of its market risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the company s nature of operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the company does not own any trading assets and does not have any off balance sheet hedging transactions in place  such as interest rate swaps and caps 
the company s net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
for example  when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  when interest earning assets reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  an increase in market rates could increase net interest income 
the company s board of directors has adopted an asset liability policy designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements 
this policy outlines guidelines and ratios dealing with  among others  liquidity  volatile liability dependence  investment portfolio composition  loan portfolio composition  loan to deposit ratio and gap analysis ratio 
key quantitative measurements include the percentage change of net interest income in various interest rate scenarios net interest income at risk and changes in the market value of equity in various rate environments net portfolio value at risk 
the company s performance as compared to the asset liability policy is monitored by its board of directors 
in addition  to effectively administer the asset liability policy and to monitor exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company maintains an asset liability committee the alco  consisting of the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer  chief retail officer  chief credit officer  certain other senior officers and certain directors 
this committee meets quarterly to review the company s financial results and to develop strategies to implement the asset liability policy and to respond to market conditions 

table of contents the company monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques  including use of an interest rate risk management model 
with the interest rate risk management model  the company projects future net interest income  and then estimates the effect of various changes in interest rates and balance sheet growth rates on that projected net interest income 
the company also uses the interest rate risk management model to calculate the change in net portfolio value over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity modeling is done at a specific point in time and involves a variety of significant estimates and assumptions 
interest rate sensitivity modeling requires  among other things  estimates of how much and when yields and costs on individual categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will respond to general changes in market rates  future cash flows and discount rates 
net interest income simulation considers the relative sensitivities of the balance sheet including the effects of interest rate caps on adjustable rate mortgages and the relatively stable aspects of core deposits 
as such  net interest income simulation is designed to address the probability of interest rate changes and the behavioral response of the balance sheet to those changes 
market value of portfolio equity represents the fair value of the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
changes in estimates and assumptions made for interest rate sensitivity modeling could have a significant impact on projected results and conclusions 
these assumptions could include prepayment rates  sensitivity of non maturity deposits and other similar assumptions 
therefore  if our assumptions should change  this technique may not accurately reflect the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income or net portfolio value 
the starting point or base case for the following table is an estimate of the following year s net interest income assuming that both interest rates and the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities remain at year end levels

there are also other scenarios run that the alco examines that vary depending on the economic environment 
these scenarios include a yield curve flattening scenario and scenarios that show more dramatic changes in rates 
the committee uses the appropriate scenarios  depending on the economic environment  in its interest rate management decisions 

table of contents capital resources stockholders equity decreased from million on december  to million on december  the decrease in stockholders equity from december  to december  was primarily due to redemption of preferred stock from the u 
s treasury department totaling million and the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock of million

the fdic s risk based capital policy statement imposes a minimum capital standard on insured banks 
the minimum ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier i capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the federal reserve board has adopted a similar risk based capital guideline for the company which is computed on a consolidated basis 
in addition  the bank regulators have adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines tier i capital to average quarterly assets  less goodwill for financial institutions 
these guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of for financial institutions that meet certain specified criteria  including that they have the highest regulatory rating 
all other holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of plus an additional cushion of at least to basis points

for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist such as if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  and did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance to help creditors in determining whether a creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties for purposes of determining whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring 
the purpose of this guidance is to eliminate diversity in practice and provide greater comparability between companies financial statements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after june  and should be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption 
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb and the international accounting standards board the iasb issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this guidance is the result of work by the fasb and iasb to develop common requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
as a result  the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the guidance is to be applied prospectively  and early application by public entities is not permitted 
adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance updating the requirements regarding the presentation of comprehensive income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to 
table of contents facilitate convergence of us gaap and ifrs 
under the new guidance  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income can be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the changes in stockholders equity 
this amendment will be applied prospectively and the amendments are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb deferred certain aspects of this guidance related to the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued accounting guidance related to the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
under the new guidance  an entity has the option to first determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if  however  the entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test and then perform the second test  if required 
this amendment is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for the fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this guidance for its goodwill review as of november  adoption did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
effects of inflation the impact of inflation  as it affects banks  differs substantially from the impact on non financial institutions 
banks have assets which are primarily monetary in nature and which tend to move with inflation 
this is especially true for banks with a high percentage of rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a bank can further reduce the impact of inflation with proper management of its rate sensitivity gap 
this gap represents the difference between interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
lakeland attempts to structure its assets and liabilities and manages its gap to protect against substantial changes in interest rate scenarios  in order to minimize the potential effects of inflation
