in light of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate  we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities within our traditional enterprise content management ecm market and also in the broader enterprise information management eim marketplace

we believe we have a strong position in the eim market 
we continue to have over of our revenues from customer support revenues  which are generally a recurring source of income  and we expect this trend will continue 
we also believe that our diversified geographic profile helps strengthen our position and helps to reduce our impact from a downturn in the economy that may occur in any one specific region 
our goal is to build on our leadership in ecm  bpm and cem and to expand our position in ix and discovery  to emerge as the leading vendor in eim 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following i revenue recognition  ii goodwill  iii acquired intangibles  iv restructuring charges  v business combinations  vi foreign currency translation  and vii income taxes 
for detailed discussions please see note significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements

customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
therefore  changes in customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period 
the terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months  with customer renewal options

special charges special charges typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay in connection with restructuring plans relating to employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities  impairment of long lived assets  acquisition related costs and other similar charges 
generally  we implement such plans in the context of integrating existing opentext operations with that of acquired entities 
actions related to such restructuring plans are  more often than not  completed within a period of one year

provision for recovery of income taxes we initiated an internal reorganization of our international subsidiaries in fiscal and continue to integrate acquisitions into this new organizational structure for the following reasons to consolidate our intellectual property within certain jurisdictions  to effect an operational reduction of our global subsidiaries with a view to  eventually  having a single operating legal entity in each jurisdiction  to better safeguard our intellectual property in jurisdictions with well established legal regimes and protections and to simplify the management of our intellectual property ownership 
we operate in several tax jurisdictions and are exposed to various foreign tax rates

use of non gaap financial measures in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with us gaap  the company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with us gaap 
these us gaap financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the company s definition may be different from similar non us gaap financial measures used by other companies and or analysts and may differ from period to period 
thus it may be more difficult to compare the company s financial performance to that of other companies 
however  the company s management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these non us gaap financial measures both in its reconciliation to the us gaap financial measures and its consolidated financial statements  all of which should be considered when evaluating the company s results 
the company uses these non us gaap financial measures to supplement the information provided in its consolidated financial statements  which are presented in accordance with us gaap 
the presentation of us gaap financial measures are not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap  but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such us gaap measures 
opentext strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
the company therefore believes that despite these limitations  it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the us gaap measures with certain non us gaap measures 
non us gaap net income and non us gaap eps are calculated as net income or net income per share on a diluted basis  excluding  where applicable  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  other income expense  share based compensation  and restructuring  all net of tax 
the company s management believes that the presentation of non us gaap net income and non us gaap eps provides useful information to investors because it excludes non operational charges 
the use of the term non operational charge is defined by the company as those that do not impact operating decisions taken by the company s management and is based upon the way the company s management evaluates the performance of the company s business for use in the company s internal reports 
in the course of such evaluation and for the purpose of making operating decisions  the company s management excludes certain items from its analysis  such as amortization of acquired intangible assets  restructuring costs  share based compensation  other income expense and the taxation impact of these items 
these items are excluded based upon the manner in which management evaluates the business of the company and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under us gaap 
the company believes the provision of supplemental non us gaap measures allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the company s core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses  and is therefore a useful indication of opentext s performance or expected performance of recurring operations and facilitates period to period comparison of operating performance 
as a result  the company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide  in addition to us gaap measures  supplementary non us gaap financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results 
the following charts provide unaudited reconciliations of us gaap based financial measures to non us gaap based financial measures for the following periods presented reconciliation of selected gaap based measures to non gaap based measures for the years ended june   and respectively

adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our non gaap based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results 
adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges from our non gaap based operating expenses as special charges are generally incurred in the aftermath of acquisitions and are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results 
adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income expense from our non gaap based operating expenses as other income expense relates primarily to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is hence therefore from our internal analysis of operating results 
adjustment relates to differences between the gaap based tax provision recovery and a non gaap based tax rate  these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of expenses that are excluded for the purpose of calculating non gaap based adjusted net income

we do not hold any securities or other investments at this time 
in accordance with the acquisition of easylink on july  see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements  our cash and cash equivalents was subsequently reduced by a payment of approximately million 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  as well as available credit facilities and committed loan facilities  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  contractual commitments  capital expenditures  and operating needs for the next months 
however  any material or further acquisition related activities may require additional sources of financing 
we do not have any restrictions on repatriation of cash from foreign subsidiaries nor do we expect taxes on repatriation of cash held in foreign subsidiaries to have a material effect on our overall liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
as at june  we accrued for withholding taxes payable of million on a cash distribution of million repatriated from our united states subsidiaries to our canadian parent company made during june the tax of million was subsequently paid in july cash flows provided by operating activities fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased by million primarily due to an increase in net income before the impact of non cash and tax items of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased by million primarily due to an increase in net income before the impact of non cash and tax items of million and an increase in tax related impacts of million 
these increases were offset by working capital changes of million 
cash used in investing activities our cash used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows used in investing activities decreased slightly by million 
the decrease is primarily due to the capital spending we made in fiscal on the construction of the second building at our headquarters in waterloo  ontario that did not reoccur in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows used in investing activities increased by million 
this was primarily due to an increase in acquisition related spending of approximately million  particularly as a result of the metastorm acquisition which alone accounted for million of cash spending in fiscal there was also a short term investment of million from a legacy acquisition that matured during fiscal but the same offsetting impact was not repeated in fiscal the remainder of the change was due to our spending in fiscal on property and equipment  primarily related to the construction of the second building at our headquarters in waterloo  ontario 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities consist of long term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees 
these inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non scheduled repayments of our long term debt financing and  when applicable  the repurchases of our common shares 
fiscal compared to fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million  primarily due to a new debt financing agreement we entered into in november  in which we borrowed million from certain financial institutions see note long term debt to our consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds from the term loan and revolver of million were partially offset by a payment of million made on november  to repay our previously outstanding long term debt 
incremental debt payments on account of the new term loan were an increase of approximately million over fiscal in addition  associated with the new debt financing agreement  we incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs  which is currently being amortized over the term of the loan see note other assets to our consolidated financial statements 
the remainder of the change in financing activities is primarily due to i an increase in the proceeds from stock options exercised by our employees in the amount of million  ii a decrease in spending on the repurchase of our common shares in the amount of million  and iii an increase in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense in the amount of million 
fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities decreased by million primarily due to i an increase in the proceeds from stock options exercised by our employees in the amount of million  ii an increase in excess tax benefits on share based compensation expense in the amount of million  and iii a decrease in spending on the repurchase of our common shares in the amount of million 
the remainder of the change was due to other financing related activities 
we did not enter into any new or additional long term debt arrangements during fiscal long term debt and credit facilities term loan on november   we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement the agreement with certain financial institutions 
the agreement provides for a million term loan facility the term loan and a million committed revolving credit facility the revolver  together referred to as the credit facility 
borrowings under the agreement are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets 
on the same day that we entered into the agreement  we borrowed million under the term loan and used a portion of the proceeds to repay all of our previously outstanding credit facility debt in the amount of million 
as of the date of this filing  we do not have any borrowings under the revolver 
the term loan has a five year term and repayments made under the term loan are equal to of the original principal amount at each quarter for the first two years  for years and and for year during fiscal we paid million on the principal balance of this term loan 
the term loan bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
the material financial covenants under the credit facility are that we must maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than at the end of each financial quarter 
consolidated leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt  including guarantees and letters of credit  over our trailing twelve months net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  restructuring  share based compensation and other miscellaneous charges  all defined as ebitda as per the agreement  and we must maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of or more at the end of each financial quarter 
consolidated interest coverage ratio is defined for this purpose as our consolidated ebitda over our consolidated interest expense  as defined in the agreement 
as of june   we were in compliance with all covenants relating to this credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relate primarily to our term loan 
as of june   we had an outstanding balance of million on the term loan 
the term loan bears a floating interest rate of libor plus a fixed rate of 
as of june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million  assuming that the loan balance as of june  is outstanding for the entire period 
foreign currency risk our reporting currency is the us dollar 
on account of our international operations  a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents is held in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of june   this balance represented approximately of our total cash and cash equivalents 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our reported cash and cash equivalents by approximately 
additionally  we have hedged certain of our canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in canada 
based on the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as at june   a one cent change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates would cause a change of approximately million in the mark to market on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from subsidiaries  other than those located in the us  are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
these functional currencies include euros  canadian dollars  australian dollars and british pounds 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the foreign currency conversion of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income loss for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income loss will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the effect foreign exchange fluctuations will have on our results going forward 
however  if there is a change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  it could have a material effect on our results of operations
