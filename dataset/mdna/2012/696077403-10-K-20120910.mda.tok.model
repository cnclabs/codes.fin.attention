item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report 
critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that our accounting policies and estimates relating to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and stock based compensation charges are the most critical 
revenue recognition revenue from corporate collaborations and licensing agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding and milestone payments 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the related performance period 
we estimate the performance period as the period in which we perform certain development activities under the applicable agreement 
reimbursements for research and development activities are recorded in the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the applicable agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the applicable agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that such milestone is substantive in nature 
revenue from grants is recognized as we provide the services stipulated in the underlying grants based on the time and materials incurred 
the million upfront payment received in january under the astrazeneca agreement and the additional million received pursuant to the september amendment have been recognized as revenue over the period ended january  the completion of the research collaboration portion of the licensing and research collaboration agreement 
accrued expenses third parties perform a significant portion of our development activities 
we review the activities performed under significant contracts each quarter and accrue expenses and the amount of any reimbursement to be received from our collaborators based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
estimating the value or stage of completion of certain services requires judgment based on available information 
if we do not identify services performed for us but not billed by the service provider  or if we underestimate or overestimate the value of services performed as of a given date  reported expenses will be understated or overstated 
stock based compensation the fair value of stock options granted has been calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to make estimates of expected volatility and expected option lives 
we estimate these factors at the time of grant based on our own prior experience  public sources of information and information for comparable companies 
the amount of recorded compensation related to an option grant is not adjusted for subsequent changes in these estimates or for actual experience 
the amount of our recorded compensation is also dependent on our estimates of future option forfeitures and the probability of achievement of performance conditions 
if we initially over estimate future forfeitures  our reported expenses will be understated until such time as we adjust our estimate 
changes in estimated forfeitures will affect our reported expenses in the period of change and future periods 
the amount and timing of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to grants of restricted stock units may be affected by employment terminations 
as a result  stock based compensation charges may vary significantly from period to period 
results of operations year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal  we recognized million in revenue  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal and fiscal consisted of million and million  respectively  of reimbursement of development costs and per employee compensation  earned at the contractual rate 
fiscal revenue also included million of federal grants under the patient protection and affordable care act of research and development research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily the result of costs relating to our on going phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd  which commenced in june research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  pl  peptide melanocortin agonists  obesity  neutrospec and other preclinical programs were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
spending to date has been primarily related to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trials and preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is the result of reducing staffing levels pursuant to our strategic decision announced in september to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials of bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formula of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction 
cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec a previously marketed imaging product on which all work is suspended and other programs which includes pl  other peptide melanocortin agonists  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated 
see item a risk factors 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increases in stock based compensation and professional fees 
income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue for fiscal  we recognized million in revenue  which includes million of federal grants under the patient protection and affordable care act of  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal consisted of million of reimbursement of development costs and per employee compensation  earned at the contractual rate 
revenue from astrazeneca for fiscal consisted of million related to our research services performed  and million related to astrazeneca s up front license fee 
in connection with the completion of the research collaboration portion of the licensing and research collaboration agreement  we recognized as revenue in fiscal all remaining deferred up front license fees received from astrazeneca 
research and development research and development expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is the result of reducing staffing levels pursuant to our strategic decision announced in september to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials of bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formula of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction 
research and development expenses related to our bremelanotide  pl  peptide melanocortin agonists  obesity  neutrospec and other preclinical programs were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
spending to date has been primarily related to our phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd and secondarily to the identification and optimization of lead compounds and to study the effects of melanocortin receptor specific compounds on food intake  obesity and other metabolic parameters and preclinical studies and a phase trial with subcutaneously administered bremelanotide 
the amount of such spending and the nature of future development activities are dependent on a number of factors  including primarily the availability of funds to support future development activities  success of our clinical trials and preclinical and discovery programs  and our ability to progress compounds in addition to bremelanotide and pl into human clinical trials 
the historical amounts of project spending above exclude general research and development spending  which decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is the result of reducing staffing levels pursuant to our strategic decision announced in september to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials of bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formula of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction 
cumulative spending from inception to june  on our bremelanotide  neutrospec a previously marketed imaging product on which all work is suspended and other programs which includes pl  other melanocortin receptor agonists  obesity and other discovery programs amounts to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
due to various risk factors described in this annual report  including the difficulty in currently estimating the costs and timing of future phase clinical trials and larger scale phase and phase clinical trials for any product under development  we cannot predict with reasonable certainty when  if ever  a program will advance to the next stage of development or be successfully completed  or when  if ever  related net cash inflows will be generated

general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is the result of reducing staffing levels pursuant to our strategic decision announced in september to focus resources and efforts on clinical trials of bremelanotide and pl and preclinical development of an inhaled formula of pl and a new peptide drug candidate for sexual dysfunction  offset by the granting of cash and equity bonuses to employees approved by our compensation committee in june income tax benefit income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal relate to the sale of new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of such losses and tax credits that we are able to sell depends on annual pools and allocations established by the state of new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have incurred net operating losses  primarily related to spending on our research and development programs 
we have financed our net operating losses primarily through equity financings and amounts received under collaborative agreements 
our product candidates are at various stages of development and will require significant further research  development and testing and some may never be successfully developed or commercialized 
we may experience uncertainties  delays  difficulties and expenses commonly experienced by early stage biopharmaceutical companies  which may include unanticipated problems and additional costs relating to the development and testing of products in animals and humans  product approval or clearance  regulatory compliance  good manufacturing practices  intellectual property rights  product introduction  marketing  sales and competition  and obtaining sufficient capital 
failure to enter into collaboration agreements and obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates and indications would impact our ability to increase revenues and could make it more difficult to attract investment capital for funding our operations 
any of these possibilities could materially and adversely affect our operations and require us to curtail or cease certain programs 
during fiscal  we used million of cash for our operating activities  compared to million used in fiscal and million used in fiscal higher net cash outflows from operations in fiscal and resulted primarily from lower revenues and the increased costs relating to our on going phase b clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of bremelanotide for the treatment of fsd 
net cash outflows from operations in fiscal were favorably impacted by the decrease in research and development expenses and the receipt of million in additional payments from astrazeneca 
our periodic accounts receivable balances will continue to be highly dependent on the timing of receipts from collaboration partners and the division of development responsibilities between us and our collaboration partners 
during fiscal  cash provided by investing activities consisted mainly of million from the sale of supplies and equipment 
during fiscal  cash provided by investing activities was million from the sale of available for sale investments 
during fiscal  cash provided by investing activities consisted mainly of  from the sale of supplies and equipment 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was  consisting entirely of payments on capital lease obligations 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  primarily from net proceeds pursuant to the completion of our firm commitment public offering that closed on march  offset by payments on capital lease obligations of  and payment of withholding taxes related to restricted stock units of  the offering consisted of the sale of  units at a price to the public of per unit 
the units consisted of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  and series b warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily reflecting the aggregate net proceeds of approximately million from the sales in august  february and june of  units   units and  units  respectively  in registered direct offerings 
each unit from the august offering consisted of one share of common stock and a five year warrant to purchase shares of common stock 
each unit from the february offering consisted of one share of common stock  a series a warrant exercisable for shares of our common stock and a series b warrant exercisable for shares of common stock 
we have incurred cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and our current liabilities were million 
in addition  on july   we closed on a million private placement 
the offering consisted of the sale of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock and series b warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
funds under the management of qvt financial lp paid for each share of common stock and for each series a warrant and each series b warrant  with the warrants exercisable at per share 
the net proceeds to us after deducting the offering expenses were million see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have certain contractual obligations  including an obligation to pay interest on series b warrants and to redeem series b warrants  in the event that the number of our authorized shares of common stock is not increased by specified dates 
if the authorized number of shares of common stock is not increased by september   we are required to commence paying per year interest on the fair value of shares underlying the series b warrants  with a minimum value determination of per share  which would result in a minimum annual interest payment of million 
if the authorized number of shares of common stock is not increased by june   the holders of series b warrants can compel redemption of all or a portion of series b warrants at the average of the highest ten consecutive day dollar volume weighted price average price of our common stock 
the redemption amount payable is a function solely of the ten consecutive day dollar volume weighted price of our common stock  and there is no upper limit on the redemption price 
we may not have sufficient funds to pay redemption prices when due  and in that event will not be able to continue operating as a going concern 
if we have sufficient funds to pay the redemption prices  this will reduce the amount of our capital available for development of our product candidates  and will result in expenditures that provide no economic benefit to our stockholders other than holders of series b warrants 
we have called a special meeting of stockholders for september  to vote on increasing the authorized number of shares of our common stock 
if the stockholders approve the increase  then no interest will be payable on the series b warrants  and the series b warrants will no longer be subject to redemption 
however  there can be no assurance that the stockholders will approve the increase at the special meeting on september  or ever 
assuming stockholder approval of the increase in authorized common stock  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of june   together with the net proceeds from private placement with net proceeds of million  are adequate to fund our planned operations  including completion of our phase b clinical trial with bremelanotide for fsd  through at least calendar year over the next twelve months we intend to focus efforts on preparing for our phase clinical trial with bremelanotide for fsd  assuming that results of the phase b trial support advancing the program  conducting preclinical research on one or more peptide melanocortin agonists for sexual dysfunction and other indications  conducting preclinical research on peptide melanocortin agonists for inflammatory disease related indications  and development and testing of an inhaled formulation of pl if stockholders do not approve the increase in authorized common stock by september   we are contractually obligated to pay interest semi annually on the value of the series b warrants at per year  with minimum annual interest payments of million  and a maximum depending on the average dollar volume weighted price of our common stock 
if stockholders do not approve the increase in authorized common stock by june   holders of series b warrants can require redemption of all or a part of those warrants at a price determined by the ten consecutive day dollar volume weighted price of our common stock 
we cannot predict the redemption price or the number of warrants  if any  which holders will seek to redeem  or whether we will have sufficient funds to pay redemption prices when and if due 
our current cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to complete all of the clinical trials required for product approval for any of our products 
we expect that the phase bremelanotide clinical trial program for fsd  which will not commence before calendar year  will require significant additional resources and capital 
we intend to seek additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements on our product candidates  including bremelanotide for fsd  or other sources 
however  sufficient additional funding to support operations past calendar year  including phase clinical trials with bremelanotide  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we will be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and relinquish  license or otherwise dispose of rights on unfavorable terms to technologies and product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
the nature and timing of our development activities are highly dependent on our financing activities 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over at least the next few years 
to achieve profitability  if ever  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and proposed products  conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market such technologies and proposed products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain  and we do not know whether we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our most significant contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases capital lease obligations total contractual obligations our license agreement related to neutrospec require royalty payments on commercial net sales and payments of up to million contingent on the achievement of specified cumulative net margins on sales by mallinckrodt 
no contingent amounts will be payable related to neutrospec unless we recommence sales and marketing of neutrospec 
we do not expect to make any such contingent payments during the next twelve months
