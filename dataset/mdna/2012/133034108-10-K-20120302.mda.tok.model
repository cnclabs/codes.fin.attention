item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis  which follows  focuses on the factors affecting our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and and financial condition at december  and and  where appropriate  factors that may affect our future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data 
executive overview net income for of million  or per diluted share  was higher than the net income of million  or per diluted share  reported for this financial performance translated to an increase in return on average assets to for  compared to in the following were significant factors influencing the results of fiscal year compared to fiscal year total loans were billion  a decrease of million  or  compared to a year ago 
the decrease in total loans was primarily related to the residential real estate loan portfolio  which declined by million due to the sale of thirty year fixed rate mortgages totaling million 
the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios grew million and million  respectively  while consumer and home equity balances declined million  investments at december  were million  an increase of  compared to december   total deposits of billion at december  increased million  or  compared to december  during  we experienced strong core deposit demand  checking  savings  and money market accounts growth of million  or  which offset the decline in retail certificates of deposit of million  or 
the overall growth across our core deposits reflects excess customer liquidity and success in obtaining several large deposit relationships  stabilized asset quality ratios and a reduction in net loan charge offs for the year resulted in a decline in the loan loss provision to million for compared to million in the allowance for credit losses compared to total loans was and at december  and  respectively  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets amounted to and at december  and  respectively  net interest income  our primary revenue source  increased  or  due to an increase in average earning assets of million or in  partially offset by a decline in our net interest margin of three basis points to during  non interest income increased million  or  primarily due to increases in investment security gains of million  loan servicing income of million and bank owned life insurance earnings and proceeds of  partially offset by the million settlement proceeds received in  and non interest expenses increased million  or  primarily as a result of the prepayment penalty on borrowings of million and increases in compensation and benefit costs of million  partially offset by declines in oreo and collections costs of million and fdic assessment costs of  critical accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
actual results could differ from our current estimates  as a result of changing conditions and future events 
several estimates are particularly critical and are susceptible to significant near term change  including the allowance for credit losses  accounting for acquisitions and our review of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment  valuation of other real estate owned  other than temporary impairment of 
table of contents investments  accounting for postretirement plans  and income taxes 
our significant accounting policies and critical estimates are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for credit losses 
management is committed to maintaining an allowance for loan losses all that is appropriate to absorb likely loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
evaluating the appropriateness of the all is a key management function  one that requires the most significant amount of management estimates and assumptions 
the all  which is established through a charge to the provision for credit losses  consists of two components a contra to total gross loans in the asset section of the balance sheet  and the reserve for unfunded commitments included in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
we regularly evaluate the all for adequacy by taking into consideration  among other factors  historical trends in charge offs and delinquencies  overall risk characteristics and size of the portfolios  ongoing review of significant individual loans  trends in levels of watched or criticized assets  business and economic conditions  local industry trends  evaluation of results of examinations by regulatory authorities and other third parties  and other relevant factors 
in determining the appropriate level of all  we use a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio 
the methodology focuses on four key elements identification of loss allocations for specific loans  loss allocation factors for certain loan types based on credit grade and loss experience  general loss allocations for other environmental factors  and the unallocated portion of the allowance 
the specific loan component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
this methodology is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we use a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of our loans and apply the related loss allocation factors 
in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan  we consider  among other factors  the obligor s debt capacity  financial condition  the level of the obligor s earnings  the amount and sources of repayment  the performance with respect to loan terms  the adequacy of collateral  the level and nature of contingent liabilities  management strength  and the industry in which the obligor operates 
these factors are based on an evaluation of historical information  as well as a subjective assessment and interpretation of current conditions 
emphasizing one factor over another  or considering additional factors that may be relevant in determining the risk rating of a particular loan but which are not currently an explicit part of our methodology  could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan 
three times annually  management conducts a thorough review of adversely risk rated commercial and commercial real estate exposures exceeding certain thresholds to re evaluate the risk rating and identify impaired loans 
this extensive review takes into account the obligor s repayment history and financial condition  collateral value  guarantor support  local economic and industry trends  and other factors relevant to the particular loan relationship 
allocations for impaired loans are based upon discounted cash flows or collateral values and are made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we periodically reassess and revise the loss allocation factors used in the assignment of loss exposure to appropriately reflect our analysis of loss experience 
portfolios of more homogenous populations of loans including home equity and consumer loans are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency rates and other economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements  including interest rates and energy costs 
an additional allocation is determined based on a judgmental process whereby management considers qualitative and quantitative assessments of other environmental factors 
finally  an unallocated portion of the total allowance is maintained to allow for measurement imprecision attributable to uncertainty in the economic environment 
because the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in our market area  concentration of risk  declines in local property values  and the results of regulatory examinations 
while management s evaluation of the all as of december  determined the allowance to be appropriate  
table of contents under adversely different conditions or assumptions  we may need to increase the allowance 
the corporate risk management group reviews the all with the bank s board of directors on a monthly basis 
a more comprehensive review of the all is reviewed with the company s board of directors  as well as the bank s board of directors  on a quarterly basis 
the adequacy of the reserve for unfunded commitments is determined in a similar manner as the all  with the exception that management must also estimate the likelihood of these commitments being funded and becoming loans 
this is accomplished by evaluating the historical utilization of each type of unfunded commitment and estimating the likelihood that the historical utilization rates could change in the future 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions at fair value  which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets and are subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and are evaluated using various fair value techniques 
goodwill impairment evaluations are required to be performed annually and may be required more frequently if certain conditions indicating potential impairment exist 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
if we were to determine that our goodwill was impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on our financial position 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using several standard valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses  as well as an estimation of the impact of business conditions 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different estimates of carrying value 
valuation of other real estate owned oreo 
periodically  we acquire property in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of debt previously contracted 
the valuation of this property is accounted for individually based on its fair value on the date of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  if the fair value of the property less the costs to sell is less than the book value of the loan  a charge or reduction in the all is recorded 
if the value of the property becomes permanently impaired  as determined by an appraisal or an evaluation in accordance with our appraisal policy  we will record the decline by charging against current earnings 
upon acquisition of a property  we use a current appraisal or broker s opinion to substantiate fair value for the property 
other than temporary impairment otti of investments 
we record an investment impairment charge at the point we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining whether an otti has occurred  we review information about the underlying investment that is publicly available  analysts reports  applicable industry data and other pertinent information  and assess our ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future 
the investment is written down to its current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to have occurred 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the future 
effectiveness of hedging derivatives 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
interest rate contracts are used by the company in the management of its interest rate risk position 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings 
when interest rates fluctuate  hedged assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value or cash flows 
gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation or changes in cash flows 
the company utilizes a third party service to evaluate the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis 
the effective portion of a gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income  net of tax  and other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated statements of condition 
the ineffective portions of cash flow hedging transactions are included in other income in the consolidated statements of income  if material 

table of contents accounting for postretirement plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine the expenses for our postretirement plans and related financial disclosure information 
postretirement plan expense is sensitive to changes in the number of eligible employees and their related demographics and to changes in the discount rate and other expected rates  such as medical cost trends rates 
as with the computations on plan expense  cash contribution requirements are also sensitive to such changes 
stock based compensation 
the fair value of restricted stock and stock options is determined on the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense  with a corresponding increase in common stock  over the longer of the service period or performance period  but in no event beyond an employee s retirement date 
for performance based restricted stock  we estimate the degree to which performance conditions will be met to determine the number of shares that will vest and the related compensation expense 
compensation expense is adjusted in the period such estimates change 
non forfeitable dividends  if any  paid on shares of restricted stock are recorded to retained earnings for shares that are expected to vest and to compensation expense for shares that are not expected to vest 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes by deferring income taxes based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated statements of condition 
we must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance for those assets determined not likely to be recoverable 
judgment is required in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities  including projections of future taxable income 
although we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets will be realized 
we are currently under review by the internal revenue service for the year ended december  although not currently under review  income tax returns for the years ended december  and are open to audit by federal and maine authorities 
if we  as a result of an audit  were assessed interest and penalties  the amounts would be recorded through other non interest expense 
non gaap financial measures and reconciliation to gaap in addition to evaluating the company s results of operations in accordance with gaap  management supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures  such as the efficiency and tangible equity ratios  tangible book value per share  and tax equivalent net interest income 
we believe these non gaap financial measures help investors in understanding the company s operating performance and trends and allow for better performance comparisons to other banks 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures remove the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the company s underlying performance 
these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap operating results  nor are they necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other financial institutions 

table of contents efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio  which represents an approximate measure of the cost required for the company to generate a dollar of revenue  is the ratio of i total non interest expense excluding prepayment penalties the numerator to ii net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis plus total non interest income excluding net gains or losses on sale of securities  otti  and proceeds from a legal settlement the denominator

net interest income net interest income is interest earned on loans  securities  and other earning assets  plus loan fees  less the interest paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income  which is our largest source of revenue and accounts for approximately of total revenues  is affected by factors including  but not limited to changes in interest rates  loan and deposit pricing strategies and competitive conditions  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets
