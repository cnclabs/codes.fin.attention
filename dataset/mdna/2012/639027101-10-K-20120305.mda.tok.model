this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item of this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements for the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements 
overview our business  industry and target market nature s sunshine products  inc together with its subsidiaries  is a natural health and wellness company primarily engaged in the manufacturing and direct selling of nutritional and personal care products 
nature s sunshine products  inc is a utah corporation with its principal place of business in provo  utah 
we sell our products to a sales force of independent distributors and managers who use the products themselves or resell them to other distributors or customers 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies 
the company has two reportable business segments that operate under the nature s sunshine products brand and are divided based on their geographic operations in the united states nsp united states and in countries outside the united states nsp international 
we 
table of contents also sell our products through a separate division and operating business segment  synergy worldwide 
synergy worldwide offers marketing plans  distributor compensation plans and product formulations that are sufficiently different from those of nsp united states and nsp international to warrant its treatment as a separately reportable business segment 
we market our products in australia  austria  belarus  canada  the czech republic  colombia  costa rica  denmark  the dominican republic  ecuador  el salvador  finland  germany  guatemala  honduras  hong kong  indonesia  ireland  japan  kazakhstan  latvia  lithuania  malaysia  mexico  mongolia  the netherlands  nicaragua  norway  panama  peru  the philippines  poland  russia  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  taiwan  thailand  ukraine  the united kingdom  the united states  venezuela and vietnam 
we export our products to several other countries  including argentina  australia  chile  israel  new zealand and norway 
in  we experienced an increase in our consolidated net sales of percent 
synergy worldwide experienced an increase in net sales revenue of approximately percent or percent in local currencies excluding the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
nsp international experienced a decrease in net sales of approximately percent compared to the same period in  and a decrease in local currency net sales of percent excluding the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations  while nsp united states net sales decreased approximately percent 
the significant sales revenue growth was from our synergy businesses in europe  korea  and the united states and our nsp russian markets excluding belarus during gains in these markets were partially offset by decreases in our nsp belarus  nsp dominican republic  nsp and synergy japan  and nsp mexico markets 
on july   we entered into a settlement agreement with nutriplus llc nutriplus  from which we acquired certain assets in in order to establish our russian business and to which we agreed to make royalty payments as a percentage of sales from our russian business 
as a result of the settlement  wherein both parties settled all claims in the arbitration and bore their own costs associated with the arbitration  the company agreed to pay nutriplus million for the release of all past and future royalty obligations 
of the million  the company applied million toward previously accrued and expensed but unpaid royalties  and million in exchange for the contract termination and extinguishment of future royalty obligations 
for the year ended december   the company recorded and expensed royalty payments to nutriplus of approximately million included in selling  general and administrative expenses  which was approximately percent of nsp international s revenue and percent of the company s consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   the company recorded and expensed royalty payments to nutriplus of approximately million  which was approximately percent of nsp international s revenue and percent of the company s consolidated revenue 
as a result of the settlement  our operating costs for the year ended december   were reduced by million compared to what they would have been  which resulted in a corresponding increase to operating income of million 
similarly  based on current sales from our russian business  we expect the settlement will result in an annual reduction of to million in operating costs and a corresponding increase in operating income above the level the company would otherwise achieve if the nutriplus royalty obligation remained in effect 
this positive impact on operating costs and operating income will fluctuate with sales volumes in our russian business 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales revenue for the year decreased from percent in the prior year to percent in the current year as a result of revenue growth primarily in synergy worldwide  the reduction of our royalty costs related to our russian business as noted above  and our successful efforts to reduce operating costs in all of our operating segments 
as a result of our overall growth in net sales revenue and reductions in operating expenses  our consolidated operating income for the year increased from percent of net sales revenue in the prior year to percent of net sales revenue in the current year 
excluding the onetime contract termination costs of million due to the nutriplus settlement  operating income would have been percent of net sales revenue in we distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of managers and independent distributors 
typically a person who joins our independent sales force begins as a distributor 
a distributor interested in earning additional income by committing more time and effort to selling our products may earn manager status  which is contingent upon attaining certain purchase levels  recruiting additional distributors and demonstrating leadership abilities 
on a worldwide basis  active managers totaled approximately  and  and active distributors and customers totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the number of active distributors and customers will increase if our existing business grows and we enter new international markets  and if current managers and distributors grow their businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our 
table of contents estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the board of directors and its audit committee 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we believe the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact and any associated risks on our business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition net sales revenue and related volume incentive expenses are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectability is reasonably assured  the amount is fixed and determinable  and title and risk of loss have passed generally  when the merchandise has been delivered 
the amount of the volume incentive is determined based upon the amount of qualifying purchases in a given month 
it is necessary for us to make estimates about the timing of when merchandise has been delivered 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience related to time in transit  timing of when shipments occurred and shipping volumes 
amounts received for undelivered merchandise are recorded as deferred revenue 
from time to time  our us operations extend short term credit associated with product promotions 
in addition for certain of our international operations  we offer credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation 
payments to distributors and managers for sales incentives or rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
payments for sales incentives and rebates are calculated monthly based upon qualifying sales 
membership fees are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the membership primarily one year 
prepaid event registration fees are deferred and recognized as revenues when the related event is held 
a reserve for product returns is recorded based upon historical experience 
we allow distributors or managers to return the unused portion of products within ninety days of purchase if they are not satisfied with the product 
in some of our markets  the requirements to return product are more restrictive 
sales returns for the years  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
this estimated allowance is based primarily on the aging category  historical trends and management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
this reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available 
investments our available for sale investment portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various fixed income securities such as us government and state and municipal bonds  mutual funds  depository certificates and equity securities 
these investments are valued using a quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or b from significant inputs that are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
our trading portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various marketable securities that are valued using quoted prices in active markets 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  we perform an analysis to assess whether it intends to sell or whether it would be more likely than not required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
for all other debt securities that experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary and not related to credit loss  we record a loss  net of any tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the credit loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss when sold 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our 
table of contents cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor and overhead 
to estimate any necessary lower of cost or market adjustments  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning and market conditions 
self insurance liabilities similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of our products results in injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
we have historically had a very limited number of product claims or reports from individuals who have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products 
these matters have historically been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we have established a wholly owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage  and have accrued a reserve that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonable estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon our history 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient  nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we self insure for certain employee medical benefits 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods  and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related assets or groups of assets over their remaining lives in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
an impairment loss is calculated by determining the difference between the carrying values and the fair values of these assets 
we did not consider any of our long lived assets to be impaired during the years ended december   or incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses for incentive trips associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent distributors and managers with paid attendance at our conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned 
we specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual 
actual results could generate liabilities more or less than the amounts recorded 
we have accrued convention and meeting costs of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or non income tax contingencies and when such loss can be reasonably estimated with a range  we record our best estimate within the range related to the contingency 
if there is no best estimate  we record the minimum of the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise the estimates 
revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
our contingencies are discussed in further detail in note  commitment and contingencies  to the notes of our consolidated financial statements  in item  part of this report 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingent reserves reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the company s consolidated income tax expense 

table of contents deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by the company when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and  we had recorded valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  as offsets to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will expire at various dates from through the company had approximately million of foreign tax credits  which begin to expire at various dates starting in changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
share based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their granted date fair values 
we record compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the vesting period of the stock options based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
we estimated forfeiture rate is based upon historical experience 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales revenue costs and expenses cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative contract termination costs operating income other income interest and other income  net interest expense foreign exchange gains  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss 
table of contents year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales revenue consolidated net sales revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  an increase of approximately percent 
the increase in net sales revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  is primarily due to improvements in our synergy worldwide segment  and was partially offset by a decline in our nsp united states and nsp international segments 
nsp united states net sales revenue related to nsp united states for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in  or a decrease of percent in compared to nsp united states managers and distributors are predominantly practitioners of nutritional supplement therapies  as well as retailers and consumers of our products  a segment that continued to be adversely affected by the economic downturn in the united states 
net sales revenue also decreased compared to the same period in the prior year due to the cancellation of some less profitable promotional programs 
the nsp united states segment includes both english and spanish language sales divisions  of which the english language division is approximately percent of segment net sales revenue 
our english language division net sales revenue decreased million for the year ended december   or percent  compared to the same period in our spanish language division net sales revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in while both the english and spanish divisions have been adversely affected by the poor economic environment  the cancellation of some less profitable promotional programs had a more significant impact on our spanish division 
active managers within nsp united states totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
a significant contributor to the decrease in the number of active managers was the discontinuance of a program that allowed distributors to attain manager status by meeting lower performance criteria 
active distributors and customers within nsp united states totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the number of active distributors and customers decreased due to the poor economic environment 
in addition  the number of active distributors also decreased due to the cancellation of some less profitable recruiting and retention programs 
nsp international nsp international reported net sales revenue for the year ended december  of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of approximately percent 
in local currencies  net sales decreased percent  compared to the same period in fluctuation in foreign exchange rates had a million favorable impact on net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in sales is due to lower local currency sales in our dominican republic  japan and mexico markets  which are predominately practitioners of nutritional supplement therapies and retailers or consumers of our products  offset by higher sales in our russian markets  which are traditionally more network marketing oriented  and positive currency fluctuations 
notable activity in the following markets contributed to the results of nsp international in nsp international s russian markets russia  ukraine  belarus and several other eastern european nations  net sales revenues increased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in excluding belarus  net sales revenues increased approximately million or percent  for the year ended december  the russian markets excluding belarus continue to build on the momentum gained in the prior year as a result of improved manager and distributor recruiting efforts and strengthening economies in the region 
however  this growth has been slowed by a growing debt crisis in belarus  which has adversely affected nsp international s belarusian distributors ability to obtain foreign currency to purchase our products and may continue to adversely affect sales going forward 
nsp international s sales in belarus were million lower for the year ended december   compared to the same period in in japan  net sales revenues decreased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   respectively  compared to the same period in in local currency  net sales decreased percent  respectively  compared to the same period in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had a million favorable impact on net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in local currency sales is partially due to the earthquake  tsunami and subsequent nuclear disasters in the spring of  which suppressed consumer confidence and spending and made it difficult to ship ordered products  as well as to retain active distributors 
nsp international s future sales in japan may be adversely affected while the country rebuilds and recovers from these disasters 
in mexico  our net sales revenues decreased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the same periods in in local currency  net sales decreased percent  compared to the same period in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had a million favorable impact on net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in local currency net sales is principally due to the continuing effects of a tax law interpretation by the mexican taxing authority requiring the collection of value added tax on all of our products sold in mexico and our compliance with this interpretation 

table of contents in the dominican republic  net sales revenues decreased approximately million  or percent  for the year ended december   respectively  compared to the same period in the decrease in sales is in part due to the elimination of promotional programs and events which historically had promoted sales growth  but did not produce profitable results

further information related to the nsp united states  nsp international and synergy worldwide business segments is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in  compared to percent in these decreases are primarily due to reductions in product and material write offs  changes in product mix between markets and lower raw material costs  partially offset by increased importation fees related to higher transfer prices within some of our foreign markets 
while the company intends to seek continued cost reductions where possible  pricing pressure on raw materials  fuel costs and other factors could adversely affect our ability to reduce or maintain our current cost of goods sold rate in the future 
volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program  and represent commission payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels 
table of contents and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives vary slightly  on a percentage basis  by product due to our pricing policies and commission plans in place in our various operations 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the decreases are primarily due to reductions in volume incentive rates due to our lower manager and distributor base within nsp united states and an increase in product purchases that pay a lower sales commission rate in synergy worldwide 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent of net sales revenue in  compared to percent in  or by approximately million to million in significant increases to selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  compared to the same period in included million of increased variable costs related to the sales growth of synergy worldwide in europe  korea and the united states as well as nsp international in the russian markets  million of performance based stock compensation costs based upon the company s determination that it is probable that the related performance metrics will be achieved  million of unfavorable currency fluctuations  and million of increased us sales tax related reserve expense due to prior year favorable adjustments of the reserve

we continue to implement cost reduction measures within all of our operating segments wherever possible 
contract termination costs on july   we entered into a settlement agreement with nutriplus  from whom we acquired certain assets in in order to establish our russian business  and to whom we agreed to pay a percentage of net sales in our russian business in the form of a royalty payment  wherein both parties settled all claims in the arbitration  and bore their own costs associated with the arbitration 
as a result of the settlement  the company agreed to pay nutriplus million for the release of all past and future obligations

for the year ended december   the company recorded and expensed royalty payments to nutriplus of approximately million  which was approximately percent of nsp international s revenue and percent of the company s consolidated revenue 
as a result of the settlement  our operating costs are expected to be reduced and our consolidated operating income is expected to be increased by to million annually based on current sales volumes from our russian business 
this expected reduction in operating costs and corresponding increase in consolidated operating income will fluctuate based on future increases or decreases in sales from our russian business 
see note  commitments and contingencies in the condensed notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

operating income for nsp united states increased approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in to million in the increase in operating income is primarily due to significant cost reductions in our selling  general and administrative expenses described above for year ended december  operating income for nsp international decreased approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  from operating income of million to an operating loss million in excluding the nutriplus related contract termination costs of million operating income for nsp international would have been million for the year ended december  the increase in operating income is primarily due to revenue growth in our russian markets excluding belarus  cost reductions within our other foreign markets and positive changes in foreign value added tax reserves 
operating income for synergy worldwide increased approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  from million to million in the increase in operating income is primarily due to growth in sales within its european  korean and us markets 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december   decreased million  compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to prior year foreign exchange gains of million in venezuela as a result of the devaluation of the bolivar and the change to a highly inflationary economy that were non recurring and recognized in  offset by net foreign exchange gains and losses in certain of our other markets based on changes in exchange rates 
the decrease in other net income in has been offset by an increase in interest and other income  net of million due to the receipt of in restricted cash in venezuela that had been previously written down 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following i adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to outside basis calculations under applicable us gaap 
changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and outside basis are expected to be recurring 
ii changes in the unrecognized tax benefits increased the effective tax rate by percent in these net gains and losses were recorded for financial reporting purposes  but were excluded from the calculation of taxable income 
iii foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in this is primarily due to differences between the lower statutory rates in foreign entities compared to the us statutory rate of 
as a net result of these and other differences  the effective tax rate for was less than the statutory rate of percent for the year ended december

volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent commission payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives vary slightly  on a percentage basis  by product due to our pricing policies and commission plans in place in our international operations 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue increased to percent in  compared to percent in the increase is partially due to additional distributors

operating income for nsp united states decreased approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in to million in the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of reduced sales described above and one time charges for severance costs  and was offset by an increase in transfer prices for product sales to our international subsidiaries  primarily nsp international

the improvement was related to growth in sales within the united states  european and korean markets and the profitable opening of a new market in vietnam 
this improvement was also the result of adjustments to the costs of some synergy worldwide products in certain markets due to a change in transfer prices from nsp united states  as well as other significant cost reductions made throughout the course of other income  net other net income for the year ended december   increased million  compared to the same period in the increase in the foreign exchange portion of other net income of million was primarily due to foreign exchange gains in venezuela as a result of the devaluation of the bolivar and the change to highly inflationary accounting  and was offset by net foreign exchange gains and losses in certain of our other markets based upon changes in exchange rates  while the decrease of million in the remaining portion of other income was primarily related to the write down of restricted cash within venezuela 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following 
table of contents i one time bad debt and worthless stock deductions related to the company s exit from brazil decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in ii the amortization of a prepaid tax resulting from a taxable gain on the sale of intercompany assets eliminated for reporting purposes  but recognized for the calculation of the consolidated income tax provision  increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in the prepaid tax was amortized over the respective life of the asset  and will no longer have an impact going forward 
iii adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations increased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to outside basis calculations under applicable us gaap 
changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and outside basis are expected to be recurring 
iv foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent 
this is primarily due to the company not recording a benefit for losses in most jurisdictions where tax losses exist  particularly with respect to the company s markets in asia 
some of these losses may be recurring or may result in benefits in future periods if these markets return to profitability 
v changes in the deferred tax asset valuations allowance increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was primarily the result of reserves being established for certain foreign affiliate deferred tax assets that were not likely to be realized due to recurring losses within the respective tax jurisdictions 
vi foreign exchange gains and losses primarily due to the company s accounting for venezuela becoming a highly inflationary economy and the impact of the devaluation of the bolivar reduced the effective tax rate by percent in these net gains and losses were recorded for financial reporting purposes  but were excluded from the calculation of taxable income 
as a net result of these and other differences  the effective tax rate for was greater than the statutory rate of percent for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including volume incentives  inventory and raw material purchases  capital assets and funding of international expansion

the company has a long term revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to million 
as of december   no amounts were drawn under the credit facility 
we believe that  with this credit facility in place  our working capital requirements can be met for the foreseeable future with cash generated from operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents and draws on the credit facility 
however  among other things  a prolonged economic downturn  a decrease in demand for our products  an unfavorable settlement of our unrecognized tax positions or non income tax contingencies could adversely affect our long term liquidity 
during  we had short term borrowings and repayments of million from our investment brokerage account secured by our available for sale investments in order to generate additional liquidity from month to month based upon our working capital needs

the company provides a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for its officers and certain key employees 
under this plan  participants may defer up to percent of their annual salary and bonus less the participant s share of employment taxes 
the deferrals become an obligation owed to the participant by the company under the plan 
upon separation of the participant from the service of the company  the obligation owed to the participant under the plan will be paid as a lump sum or over a period of either three or five years 
as we cannot easily determine when our officers and key employees will separate from the company  we have classified the obligation greater than five years for payment 
at december   there were million of liabilities 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to grow our international operations 
net sales revenue  operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in international operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in u 
s 
laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our net sales revenue and approximately percent of our operating expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is generally the functional currency  while certain regions  including russia and the ukraine  are served by a us subsidiary through third party entities  for which all business is conducted in us dollars 
we conduct business in twenty three different currencies with exchange rates that are not on a one to one relationship with the us dollar 
all revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  our operating results will be positively or negatively affected by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to another fluctuating currency 
given the uncertainty and diversity of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition  but we have provided consolidated sensitivity analyses below of functional currency reporting currency exchange rate risks 
changes in various currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
additional discussion of the impact on the effect of currency fluctuations has been included in our management s discussion and analysis included in part ii  item of this report 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our net sales revenue  costs and expenses and operating income in connection with strengthening of the us dollar our reporting currency by  and against every other fluctuating functional currency in which we conduct business 
we note that our individual net sales revenue  cost and expense components and our operating income were equally sensitive to increases in the strength of the us dollar against every other fluctuating currency in which we conduct business 
we have excluded the contract termination costs of million in connection with the nutriplus arbitration settlement as it is not subject to fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands with strengthening of us dollar by net sales revenue cost and expenses cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative operating income excluding contract termination costs as noted above  certain of our operations  including russia and the ukraine  are served by a us subsidiary through third party entities  for which all business is conducted in us dollars 
although changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the russian ruble or the ukrainian hryvnia do not result in currency fluctuations within our financial statements  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these other currencies can significantly affect the prices of our products and the purchasing power of our independent managers and distributors within these markets 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities by those balance sheet line items that are subject to exchange rate risk  together with the total gain or loss from the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to our various fluctuating functional currencies 
the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities  taken by balance sheet line items  is somewhat less than the sensitivity of our operating income to increases in the strength of the us dollar in relation to other fluctuating currencies in which we conduct business

none of our liabilities that are denominated in a local currency other than the us dollar and that are subject to exchange rate risk exceeded million upon translation into us dollars 
we use the spot exchange rate for translating balance sheet items from local currencies into our reporting currency 
the respective spot exchange rate for each such local currency meeting the foregoing thresholds is provided in the table as well

we use the annual average exchange rate for translating items from the statement of operations from local currencies into our reporting currency 
year ended december  canada dollar japan yen korea won mexico peso venezuela bolivar the local currency of the foreign subsidiaries is used as the functional currency  except for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies or where the company s operations are served by a us based subsidiary for example  russia and ukraine 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at year end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each year for the results of operations 
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the functional currency in highly inflationary economies is the us dollar and transactions denominated in the local currency are re measured as if the functional currency were the us dollar 
the re measurement of local currencies into us dollars creates translation adjustments  which are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
a country is considered to have a highly inflationary economy if it has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately percent or more over a three year period as well as other qualitative factors including historical inflation rate trends increasing and decreasing  the capital intensiveness of the operation and other pertinent economic factors 
during  venezuela was considered to be highly inflationary  as noted above 
with the exception of venezuela  there were no other countries considered to have a highly inflationary economy during  or as of january   venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy 
accordingly  the us dollar became the functional currency for the company s subsidiary in venezuela 
all gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of its financial statements are determined using official rates 
on january   the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the bolivar against the us dollar 
currency restrictions enacted by the government of venezuela require approval from the government s currency control agency organization in order for the company s subsidiary in venezuela to obtain us dollars at the official exchange rate to pay 
table of contents for imported products or to repatriate dividends back to the company 
prior to january   the market rate  which is substantially lower than the official rate  was available to obtain us dollars or other currencies without approval of the government s currency control organization 
in  the government of venezuela enacted additional currency restrictions  which effectively replaced the market rate with the system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  which is administered by the venezuela central bank 
under sitme  entities domiciled in venezuela can obtain us dollar denominated securities in limited quantities each month through banking institutions approved by the government 
at this time  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the future state of exchange controls in venezuela and its availability of us dollars at the official exchange rate or at the sitme rate 
however  the company has been successful so far repatriating funds from venezuela for imported products using the sitme rate 
the company re measures its results in venezuela at the sitme rate  which was approximately bolivars per us dollar as of december  as a result of the events described in the preceding paragraphs  the company recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of in connection with the re measurement of its balance sheet to reflect the highly inflationary designation and the devaluation due to the negative position of the company s venezuelan subsidiary s net monetary assets  which is recorded in foreign exchange gains or losses  a part of other income 
the success of future operations will be affected by several factors  including the company s ability to take actions to mitigate the effect of devaluation  further actions of the venezuelan government and economic conditions in venezuela  such as inflation and consumer spending 
during and  the company s venezuelan subsidiary s net sales revenue represented approximately percent and percent of consolidated net sales revenue  respectively 
the company s venezuelan subsidiary held total assets of approximately million and million which includes an intercompany receivable denominated in us dollars of million and million and net assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
these objectives are accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities 
on december   we had investments of million of which million were municipal obligations  which carry an average fixed interest rate of percent and mature over a year period 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations
