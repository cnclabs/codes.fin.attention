overview we are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics  cytokines or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we have also been one of the first companies to test antibody combinations as a possibly improved method of cancer therapy  and as a result have also embarked on the development of bispecific bifunctional monoclonal antibodies targeting two distinct antigens on the same cancer cells 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately active patents in the us and more than other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we have continued to transition our focus away from the development and commercialization of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we manufacture and commercialize our leukoscan product in territories where regulatory approvals have previously been granted 
leukoscan is indicated for diagnostic imaging for determining the location and extent of infection inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis  including patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
from inception in through june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
see risk factors under item a in this annual report on form k for other factors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have accounted for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables as a separate unit of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
effective july   we apply asu multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  to our revenue arrangements containing multiple deliverables that were entered into or which significantly modified existing arrangements 
we allocate revenue consideration  excluding contingent consideration  based on the relative selling prices of the separate units of accounting contained within an arrangement containing multiple deliverables 
selling prices are determined using fair value  when available  or our estimate of selling price when fair value is not available for a given unit of accounting 
in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition at the inception of a collaboration agreement 
the criteria requires that i we determine if the milestone is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the milestone is achieved 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts based on historical trends  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive income loss 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income loss 
stock based compensation we currently have an employee share option plan  or the plan  which permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees for up to million shares of common stock 
a summary of this plan is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant  those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have seven year contractual terms 
certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the plan 
the fair value of each option granted during the years ended june   and is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in the following table years ended june  expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate the weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during the years ended june   and were  and per share  respectively 
we used historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected stock price volatility was calculated using our daily stock trading history 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have a total of  shares underlying non vested options and restricted stock grants outstanding as of june  as of june   and there was million  million and million  respectively  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the weighted average remaining contractual terms of the exercisable shares is years and years as of june  and  respectively 
reimbursement of research development costs research and development costs that are reimbursable under collaboration agreements are included as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we record these reimbursements as a reduction of research and development expenses as our partner in the collaboration agreement has the financial risks and responsibility for conducting these research and development activities 
impairment of assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of our ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
based on our review  we believe there is no impairment at june  life insurance policies we have life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  which are for the benefit of the company 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  we recognize the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset on the balance sheet 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in license fee revenue 
in fiscal  million of license fee revenue was earned under the terms of the amendment agreement with ucb whereby ucb received the right to sublicense to a third party subject to our consent of the sublicensee and sublicensing agreement  a license to develop  manufacture  market and sell our drug epratuzumab  for the united states and certain other territories 
during the fiscal year  we recognized as revenue the receipt of million for milestone payments under the terms of the nycomed agreement 
product sales of leukoscan in europe were comparable for each of the years ended june  and at million and million  respectively 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or due to a decline in government funded research grants 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of million or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  this decrease resulted primarily from million of lower spending for clinical trials  partially offset by higher outside services 
reimbursement of research and development expenses for the fiscal year increased to million compared to million in fiscal  but is expected to decline significantly subsequent to june  cost of goods sold was million in each of the fiscal years ended june  and gross profit margins were for both the and fiscal years 
sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at million for both the and fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased by million or from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to million of decreased legal expenses principally related to lower expenses pertaining to the finra arbitration hearing and other legal matters for the year ended this decrease in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by recognition of additional incentive compensation to our chairman in accordance with his employment agreement resulting from the company s profitability for the fiscal year 
on october   we were awarded a cash grant of approximately million under the qtdp program administered under section d of the internal revenue code 
we recognized the full million of the grant as of the date of notification since we had already incurred all of the qualifying expenses as of the date of notification 
since this program was non recurring in nature  we elected to classify this payment as other income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss for the year ended june  there was no similar program in the fiscal year ended june  a gain of million was reported for the year ended june  on the sales and redemptions of ars with a carrying value of million par value of million 
there were no such sales for the fiscal year ended june  interest and other income of thousand for the year ended june  decreased by million from million for the same period in this decline was primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of million from an insurance claim for equipment failure 
income tax expense of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  was the result of income taxes for the domestic and foreign operations 
net income attributable to immunomedics  inc common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share as compared to net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of million or 
the fiscal year did not reflect any license fee revenues from either the ucb agreement or the nycomed agreement  which had amounted to million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year 
in august  we received notice from ucb relieving us of our responsibilities for the manufacturing of epratuzumab  the only remaining obligation under the ucb agreement  thus allowing us to record as revenue the full amount of the remaining deferred license fee revenue 
in march  we had completed amortization of the remaining upfront fees deferred under the nycomed agreement 
during both the and fiscal years  we recognized as revenue the receipt of million for milestone payments under the terms of the nycomed agreement 
product sales for the year ended june  were million  as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of million or due primarily to higher sales volume of leukoscan in europe over the previous year 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were million as compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million  or  due to the timing and size of the grant programs in the fiscal year 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million as compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of million or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june   due primarily to a million decrease of research and development expense reimbursement  million of higher spending for clinical trials  and million for higher patent related expenses  partially offset by reduced materials and lab supplies 
reimbursement of research and development expenses for the fiscal year declined to approximately million compared to million in fiscal cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended june  decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal year ended june  during the year ended june   cost of goods sold included million of expense as a result of the inventory reserve on certain of our leukoscan work in process inventories  which were deemed to be unsaleable due to a third party manufacturer s process deviation that resulted in product that did not meet our quality control standards 
excluding the impact of an inventory reserve adjustment for work in process  gross profit margins were for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  sales and marketing expenses remained unchanged at million for both the and fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by million  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to increased legal expenses of million pertaining primarily to the finra arbitration hearing related to our ars and other legal matters  as well as increased employee related costs of million 
this was partially offset by the recognition in fiscal year of million of additional incentive compensation to our chairman in accordance with his employment agreement  resulting from our profitability for the fiscal year 
on october   we received notification from the department of the treasury that we had been awarded a total cash grant of approximately million under the qtdp program administered under section d of the internal revenue code  of which approximately million relates to qualifying expenses we had previously incurred during the fiscal year and the cash was received during the second quarter of fiscal the remainder of the grant of approximately million was received during the first quarter of fiscal based on qualifying expenses we had incurred during the fiscal year 
we recognized the full million of the grant as of the date of notification since we had already incurred all of the qualifying expenses 
a gain of million was reported for the year ended june  on the sales and redemptions of ars with a carrying value of million par value of million  as compared to a million gain on the sale of ars that had a carrying value of million par value of million for the same period in see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities 
interest and other income of million for the year ended june  decreased by million from million for the same period in this decline was primarily the result of lower rates of return on investments and lower cash balances during the fiscal year 
this decline for the fiscal year included the lower level of the amortization of the discount for the ars of million  as compared to million for the previous fiscal year 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of million as a result of our sale of approximately million of new jersey state net operating losses or nol s 
there were no comparable sales of nol s in fiscal for both the and fiscal years we recorded a federal income tax provision of million 
the fiscal year provision was offset by a federal tax refund received for the fiscal year alternative minimum tax paid as provided by the federal troubled asset relief program 
in addition  for the fiscal year we recorded a million reduction of tax obligations of our foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a  tax provision for our foreign subsidiaries 
net loss allocable to immunomedics  inc common stockholders for fiscal year is million  or per share  as compared to net income of million  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our product candidates in development were million for fiscal year ended june   million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses decreased by million in fiscal year  or  as compared to fiscal year research and development expenses increased million in fiscal year  or  as compared to fiscal we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple product candidates at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consist of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs increased by million  or  for the year ended june  compared to june  research costs decreased by million  or  for the year ended june  compared to the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs were million in fiscal as compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to salary increases and lower employee turnover resulting in fewer open positions during the year 
personnel costs were million for both and  with salary increases in offset by employee turnover 
the use of outside research and testing services in fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  over the use of outside research and testing services in fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to this decrease was primarily the result of outside research and testing procedures that were unnecessary for fiscal indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to research based on research spending levels for fiscal were million as compared to million in  an increase of million or  primarily as a result of increased employee related costs 
for fiscal  these expenses decreased by million  or  to million as compared to  primarily resulting from the decline of research spending as compared to product development spending  resulting in a lower allocation percentage of general and administrative costs 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by million or to million as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total increased by million  or  to million as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following in fiscal  and the company has benefited from cost efficiencies realized on labor and overhead as a result of continued efforts on the development of veltuzumab for nycomed  for which the company has been reimbursed 
in fiscal  the level of reimbursement received from nycomed increased million  from million received in  to million 
in fiscal  the level of reimbursement received from nycomed declined million  from million received in  to million received in the company expects the reimbursement from nycomed for fiscal to decline as compared to the level 
clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or from this reduction was primarily the result of the completion of the clivatuzumab tetraxetan hpam phase iib clinical trial during the fiscal year 
clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million  or  over  a result of increased patient enrollment for clivatuzumab tetraxetan hpam and milatuzumab clinical trials 
personnel costs in fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to  with salary increases in offset by lower employee levels during the year 
personnel costs in were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to  primarily due to salary increases and higher staffing levels 
patent expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from this reduction was primarily due to the completion of patent related expenses for legal actions during the fiscal year  resulting in lower professional fees 
patent expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from this increase was the result of higher professional fees incurred for patent litigation defense during the year 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from this reduction was primarily the result of lower levels of clinical trial participation during the year  partially offset by a slightly higher level of manufacturing development requirements for veltuzumab product for takeda nycomed 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  over this reduction was primarily the result of reduced levels of production of veltuzumab as requested by nycomed  partially offset by higher levels of clinical trial participation 
expenses for outside testing were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from this increase was the result of increased testing for process validations and offsite lyophilization for product development 
expenses for outside testing were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from this decline was primarily the result of reduced testing involving nycomed related production 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to development based on spending levels increased by million or to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased employee related costs 
indirect administrative and support services that are allocated to development based on development spending levels increased by million or to million in fiscal year as compared to  primarily resulting from increased product development spending  resulting in a higher allocation percentage of general and administrative costs 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period years i ii iii the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient follow up in light of trial results  the number of clinical sites required for trials  and the number of patients that ultimately participate 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  immunomedics principal sources of funds have been the private and public sale of debt and equity securities and revenues from licensing  which provided up front and milestone payments  as well as funding of development costs and other licensing possibilities 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need to complete its pipeline of research and development programs  on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if the company were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the terms of any such debt or equity financing may include covenants which may limit our future ability to manage the business 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended june  the increase in the current fiscal year s cash flow provided by operations is primarily due to the receipt of million as part of the ucb amendment agreement  offset in part by the milestone payments totaling million that were received from nycomed in and the non recurring million received under the qtdp program in the fiscal year 
for fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million as compared to million used in operations for fiscal this increase in the cash flow used in operations was primarily the result of higher research and development expenses as a result of reduced level of research and development expense reimbursements and increased legal and clinical trial expense levels 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year 
the decrease in cash flow from investing activities for the fiscal year is primarily due to the prior year s receipt of million from the proceeds for the sales of auction rate securities and million in proceeds from an insurance claim  which were not repeated in the fiscal year 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million  resulting primarily from the issuance of a warrant to acquire  shares of the company s common stock to ucb as part of the ucb amendment agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was million  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
at june   we had working capital of million  representing an increase of million from the million in working capital that the company had at june  this increase in working capital was primarily a result of the million net cash provided by operations 
at june   we had working capital of million  representing a decrease of million from the million in working capital that the company had at june  this decline in working capital was caused by million of cash used in operations offset in part by million in proceeds received from the sale of non current auction rate securities 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at june  represented an increase of million from million at june  the increase for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the million in cash provided by operations and million in net cash flow from financing activities  principally the issuance of common stock purchase warrants to ucb 
our cash and cash equivalents of million at june  represented a decrease of million from million at june  the decline for fiscal year was primarily attributable to our use of cash in operations  partially offset by the sales and redemptions of million of certain ars 
other liquidity matters we have million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at june  based on our expected cash utilization rate  we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements in fiscal year  are expected to increase to million  an increase over fiscal year due to increased spending for research and development  lower reimbursement from nycomed and increased clinical trial activities including further clinical development of clivatuzumab in patients with pancreatic cancer  as well as a number of new clinical studies that are supported by us and our corporate partners  which is partially offset by lower legal and professional fees 
we are also evaluating plans to initiate a phase iii registration trial of clivatuzumab in patients with pancreatic cancer 
we will need to secure additional funding to advance clivatuzumab into this phase iii trial 
we expect research and development activities to continue to expand over time  and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to continue to conduct development of product candidates in line with our pipeline included in our long term corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to conduct our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
our ability to raise capital through public and private debt or equity financings may be negatively impacted by the current weak economy 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available when we need it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  our ability to continue our business would be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the terms of any such debt or equity financing may include covenants which may limit our future ability to manage the business 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources  when necessary  to fund our strategic priorities 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility and employment contracts in effect for our chairman of the board  chief medical officer and chief scientific officer and the president chief executive officer 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation thereafter total operating lease employment contracts total in february  we renewed our operating lease for our morris plains  new jersey facility for an additional term of years expiring in october at a base annual rate of million  which has a fixed rate through october and increases thereafter every five years 
the lease amendments included an additional  square feet  enabling us to lease the entire facility 
included are amounts due under employment contracts with david m 
goldenberg  our chief medical officer and chief scientific officer  through and cynthia sullivan  our president and chief executive officer  through the five year employment contract with david m 
goldenberg was entered into effective july  this contract also included a minimum royalty agreement  a percentage of the consideration the company receives from licensing agreements  sales of intellectual properties and disposition of undeveloped assets  as disclosed in the employment agreement 
the amounts included above are only the minimum payments and do not include possible adjustments to existing salaries  additional incentive compensation or potential bonus payments as set forth in the employment contract 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs  to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
we adopted this guidance on january   as required  which did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  an amendment of the codification topic  comprehensive income  or asu asu increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and facilitates convergence of gaap and international financial reporting standards by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
asu requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present i each component of net income along with total net income  ii each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and iii a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu does not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects  and the tax effect for each component must be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or presented in the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
asu does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
we have adopted the single continuous statement approach and have presented the statement of comprehensive income loss retrospectively for all fiscal years 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu eliminated the requirement to reflect reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
this had no impact on the our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
we have not entered into and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments
