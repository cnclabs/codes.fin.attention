there has been no significant change in the types of services offered by the bank since its inception 
the company has no present plans regarding a new line of business requiring the investment of a material amount of total assets 
most of the company s business originates from san luis obispo and santa barbara counties and there is no emphasis on foreign sources and application of funds 
the company s business  based upon performance to date  does not appear to be seasonal 
the company does not have any customers that represent more than of the company s consolidated revenues  and it operates in a single segment

the bank holds service marks issued by the us patent and trademark office for the acorn design  the oakley design  deeply rooted in your hometown and heritage oaks bank expect more 
acquisition and dispositions our strategy is to increase the company s earning assets and deposits both through organic growth and  when appropriate  through acquisitions 
historically  the company s acquisitions have focused on expansion and diversification of the markets the company serves  or strengthening its competitive position in existing markets  as evidenced by the company s acquisition of hacienda bank in  which expanded the bank s position in northern santa barbara county and business first national bank business first in  which added two branches to the bank s network and marked the company s entry into southern santa barbara county 
both of these acquisitions were merged into the bank 
however  due to restrictions placed on the company by the consent order and written agreement as more fully discussed later in this business section  the company has been precluded from undertaking any acquisitions since march of the company continues to believe that strategic acquisitions will continue to be an element of its long term growth potential and at such time as the consent order and written agreement are lifted  the company will again begin evaluating acquisition opportunities that are consistent with its strategic growth plans 

table of contents employees as of december   the bank had full time equivalent employees 
the bank s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and the bank has not experienced a work stoppage 
the bank believes that its employee relations are positive 
local economic climate the economy in the company s primary market area san luis obispo and santa barbara counties is based primarily on agriculture  tourism  light industry  oil and retail trade 
additionally  the local economy in san luis obispo county and to a lesser degree santa barbara county is dependent on the level of employment generated by state and local government agencies 
services supporting these industries have also developed in the areas of medical  financial and educational services 
the population of san luis obispo county  the city of santa maria in northern santa barbara county  and the city of santa barbara totaled approximately   and  respectively  according to the most recent economic data provided by the us census bureau 
the moderate climate allows a year round growing season in the local economy s agricultural sector 
the central coast s leading agricultural industry is the production of wine grapes and the related production of premium quality wines 
vineyards in production have grown significantly over the past several years throughout the company s service area 
in addition  cattle ranching represents a major part of the agriculture industry in the company s market 
furthermore  access to numerous recreational activities and destinations including lakes  mountains and beaches provide a relatively stable tourist industry from many areas including the los angeles orange county basin  the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley 
the general business climate in through proved to be challenging not only on the national level  but within the state of california and more specifically the company s primary market area 
as the real estate market and general economic conditions waned throughout those years  the ability of borrowers to satisfy their obligations to the financial sector languished 
although the company s primary market area has historically witnessed a more stable level of economic activity  the weakened state of the real estate market in conjunction with a decline in economic activity in the company s primary market negatively impacted the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
the labor market information published by the california employment development department in december shows the unemployment rate within california to be approximately  which is down modestly from its recent highs 
within the company s primary market area  the labor market information also shows the unemployment rate within san luis obispo and santa barbara major metropolitan areas improving in  as these areas exited with unemployment levels below 
management remains cautiously optimistic that has shown what appear to be the early signs that the company s primary market  may be beginning to stabilize as compared to the significant downward trends experienced during  and the signs of stabilization are not only reflected in the improving unemployment rates mentioned above  but we are also seeing a general improvement in the financial information being provided by our customers as part of their regular loan reviews 
additionally  several local economists have recently reported that the improvements in unemployment  the tourism industry  housing and household income are all indicators of stabilization in our primary markets 
however  there can be no guarantee that the impacts of growing concerns about the global economy may not have trickle down effects on the local economy in which the company operates 
should global economic conditions worsen and eventually affect our local economy  it could negatively impact the financial condition of borrowers to whom the company has extended credit 
in this instance  the company may suffer credit losses and be required to make further significant provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
competition banking and the financial services industry in california generally  and in the company s service area specifically  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the organization of new banking entities 
as it relates to lending opportunities  the other factor that has arisen over the last few years has been increased competition due to a smaller pool of quality lending opportunities as a result of the economic climate experienced since in order to compete with other financial institutions in its service area  the bank relies principally upon direct personal contact by officers  directors  employees  local advertising programs  and specialized services 
the bank emphasizes to customers the advantages of dealing with a locally owned and community oriented institution 
the bank also seeks to provide special services and programs for individuals in its primary service area who are employed in the agricultural  professional and business fields  such as loans for equipment  tools of trade or expansion of practices or businesses 
larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of larger marketing campaigns and greater branch distribution 

table of contents they also provide services  such as trust services  international banking  discount brokerage and insurance services  which the bank is not currently authorized or prepared to offer 
to compensate for this  the bank has made arrangements with correspondent banks and with others to provide such services for its customers 
for borrowers requiring loans in excess of the bank s legal lending limits  the bank offers loans on a participating basis with correspondent banks and with other independent banks and will retain the portion of such loans that are within its lending limit 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes involving frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services that have further increased competition 
there is no assurance that these technological improvements  if made  will increase the company s operational efficiency or that the company will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
effect of government policies and recent legislation banking is a business that depends largely on interest rate differentials to generate profits 
in general  the difference between the interest rate received by the company on loans extended to its customers and interest earned on securities held in its investment portfolio and the interest rate paid by the company on deposits and other borrowings comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment 
the commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board  which are often implemented to address the economic conditions being experienced 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation  combating recession and providing liquidity through its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits 
such interest rates also effect the bank s pricing on loans and what is paid on deposits 
the nature and impact on the company from future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies  as is more fully discussed in supervision and regulation  below 
supervision and regulation regulatory order and written agreement the bank became subject to a consent order the order  effective march   with the fdic  its principal federal banking regulator  and the dfi which requires the bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
the bank s stipulation to the issuance by the fdic and the dfi of the order resulted from certain findings in a report of examination roe resulting from an examination of the bank conducted in september in stipulating to the issuance of the order  the bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions in the roe 
on march   the company entered into a written agreement the written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco frb  which requires the company to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
under the written agreement  the company is required to develop and submit for approval  a plan to maintain sufficient capital at the company and the bank within days of the date of the written agreement 
the written agreement further provides  among other things  that the company shall not declare or pay dividends without prior approval of the frb  take dividends from the bank  make any distribution of interest  principal or other sums on subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  incur  increase  or guarantee any debt 
the company submitted the required capital plan within the time required and has not paid any dividends to its stockholders  taken any dividends from the bank or paid any interest  principal or other sums on its outstanding subordinated debt or trust preferred securities  nor has it incurred  increased or guaranteed any debt since the issuance of the written order and written agreement 

table of contents under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures as more fully discussed below 
the bank immediately took steps to comply with the order  the most significant of which was the completion of a capital raise of approximately million in march the bank will continue to take all steps necessary to achieve full compliance with the order 
among the corrective actions required are for the bank to develop and adopt a plan to maintain the minimum capital requirements for a well capitalized bank  and to reach and maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at the bank level beginning days from the issuance of the order 
as a result of the capital raise in march and a return to positive operating results in  the bank was able to exceed these minimum requirements and as of december  the bank s leverage ratio and total risk based capital ratio were and  respectively and remain in compliance with the order 
the bank has been in compliance with this provision of the order for eight consecutive quarters 
in addition  pursuant to the order  the bank must retain qualified management  must notify the fdic and the dfi in writing when it proposes to add any individual to its board of directors  employ any new senior executive officer  or increase the duties and responsibilities of a senior executive officer  and must conduct an independent study of management and personnel structure of the bank 
a consultant was retained to complete the required management study  the results of which were approved by the board and an action plan to address the findings of such study was implemented during the bank has notified its regulators and received approval for new or changed executive officer roles since the order s issuance 
under the order  the bank s board of directors was directed to increase its participation in the affairs of the bank  assuming full responsibility for the approval of sound policies and objectives and for the supervision of all the bank s activities 
the board of directors took additional steps to reevaluate such oversight and enhance  where appropriate  the frequency  duration  scope and depth of matters covered at its board meetings in response to the current economic environment and concerns raised in the roe 
in direct response to the roe  a joint regulatory compliance committee of the board of directors was formed at both the bank and company levels to oversee the bank s and company s response to all regulatory matters  including the order and the written agreement 
detailed tracking of the order s requirements  and the bank s progress in responding thereto  are reviewed and reported at such committee meetings  with regular reports then being provided by the committee to the full board 
further  and prior to the issuance of the order  the boards of both the bank and the company directed chairman michael morris to temporarily increase his direct oversight of management to ensure an appropriate response at both the bank and company to the concerns raised in the roe 
as a result of this increased oversight and the changes to management  the bank s position significantly improved in and the order further required the bank to increase its allowance for loan losses alll  as of the date of the roe  by million and to review and revise its alll methodology 
the bank immediately increased the alll as required and revised its policy for determining the adequacy of the alll to include an assessment of market conditions and other qualitative factors 
the bank s policy otherwise continues to provide for a comprehensive determination of the adequacy of its alll  which is reviewed at least once each calendar quarter 
the results of this review are reported to senior management and the board  and any adjustments to the allowance must be recorded in the calendar quarter it is discovered  with an offsetting adjustment to current operating earnings 
since the third quarter of  the company has recorded an additional million of provisions and ended with million in the alll allowance  which represents of gross receivables and of non performing loans 
with respect to classified assets which existed as of the date of the roe  the order also requires the bank to charge off or collect all assets classified as loss and one half of the assets classified as doubtful  and within days of the order  to reduce its level of assets classified as substandard as of the date of the roe to no more than the greater of million or of tier capital plus the alll 
as of december   the bank met the requirement to charge off or collect all assets classified as loss and one half of the assets classified as doubtful as of the date of the roe 
the bank complied with the requirement of the roe in this regard and reduced the specific group of classified assets identified in the roe to less than million or of tier capital plus alll well before the day deadline 
as of december   total classified assets remaining from the specific pool identified in the roe was million or of tier capital plus alll 
although the total level of classified assets as of december  remained elevated  due to the continued migration of loans to classified status during  the bank was able to reduce the level of classified assets significantly in  through a combination of sales of troubled loans  charge offs and recoveries  customer work outs and improvements in customer credit quality 
total classified assets at december  were million or of tier capital plus alll 

table of contents the order requires that the bank develop or revise  adopt and implement a plan  which must be approved by the fdic and dfi  to reduce the concentration in commercial real estate loans  particularly focusing on reducing loans for construction and land development 
in addition  the bank was required to develop a plan for reducing the number of pass graded loans designated as watch list credits to an acceptable level  and develop or revise its written lending and collection policies to provide more effective guidance and control over the bank s lending function 
the bank believes it has accomplished all of these requirements 
the order restricts the bank from taking certain actions without the prior written consent of the fdic and the dfi  including paying cash dividends  and from extending additional credit to certain types of borrowers 
the bank has not paid dividends to the company 
in addition  the company has not paid cash dividends on common stock since the first quarter of nor has it paid cash dividends on series a preferred stock since the order was issued in march in addition  the bank has put processes and controls in place to ensure extensions of credit  directly or indirectly  are not granted to those who are related to borrowers of loans charged off or classified as loss  substandard or doubtful and that new loans or advances to borrowers whose loans are classified substandard or doubtful have prior board approval 
the bank has also acknowledged that neither the loan committee nor the board of directors will approve any extension to a borrower classified substandard or doubtful without first collecting all past due interest in cash 
the order further requires the bank to develop or revise  adopt and implement a revised liquidity policy that adequately addresses liquidity needs and reduces reliance on non core funding sources 
the order also requires the bank to adopt a contingency funding plan to adequately address contingency funding sources and appropriately reduce contingency funding reliance on off balance sheet sources and develop an adequate amount of on balance sheet liquidity for contingency funding purposes 
the bank has since revised its current liquidity policy and has developed a contingency funding plan 
the bank s liquidity ratio has also increased significantly since the order s inception 
the order also requires that the bank prepare and submit a revised business plan  that is to include a comprehensive budget  and a year strategic plan  and to further revise its investment policy 
the bank has since prepared a comprehensive budget  revised the investment policy and developed a revised business plan and year strategic plan  all of which are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis 
management believes it has taken the required steps to substantially address the terms of the order and written agreement 
however ultimately  compliance with the order and written agreement will continue to be determined by the issuing regulatory agencies through quarterly monitoring and future examinations 
the bank s most recent regulatory examination concluded in early and a final report of examination is still pending 
therefore  the company and the bank cannot confirm compliance with the full scope of the order or the written agreement at this time 
the forgoing discussion of the order and written agreement are qualified by reference to the complete text of the order and written agreement  which can be found in the current reports on form k filed with the sec on march   and march   respectively

set forth below is a summary description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the company and the bank 
the description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
the following requirements and limitations are separate and distinct from the order and written agreement  discussed above 
the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act  and is registered as such with  and subject to the supervision of  the federal reserve board

table of contents the company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if  after giving effect to such acquisition of shares  the company would own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank 
prior approval of the federal reserve board is also required for the merger or consolidation of the company with another bank holding company 
the company is prohibited by the bank holding company act  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging  directly or indirectly  in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  the company may  subject to the prior approval of the federal reserve board  engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
see discussion under financial modernization legislation below for additional information 
the federal reserve board may require that the company terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest subsidiaries or affiliates when the federal reserve board determines that the activity or the control or the subsidiary or affiliates constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries 
the federal reserve board also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt

under the federal reserve board s regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe and unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve board s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice  or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations  or both 
the dodd frank act discussed in more detail below added additional guidance regarding the source of strength doctrine and directed the federal bank regulatory agencies to promulgate new regulations to increase the capital requirements for bank holding companies to a level that matches those of their subsidiary banking institutions 
the company and the bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services

capital standards the federal banking agencies have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions resulting in asset recognition on the balance sheet  and the extension of credit facilities such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are determined by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
a banking organization s or holding company s capital is generally classified into one of two tiers 
tier i capital consists primarily of common equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most intangible assets  any disallowed portion of deferred tax assets and certain other limitations 
tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses  cumulative preferred stock  long term preferred stock  eligible term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier ii capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of total qualifying capital to risk adjusted assets of  a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of  and a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio  of 
however  the bank s order requires higher levels of capital including a leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
regulatory agencies have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at levels significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized or increase the minimum amount of capital required for capital adequacy purposes 
such a change could affect the ability of the company to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends 
in addition  the dfi has authority to take possession of the business and properties of a bank in the event that the tangible shareholders equity of a bank is less than the greater of i of the bank s total assets or ii  for additional details see note regulatory matters  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k 
see also capital within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
these actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of deposit insurance  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 

table of contents additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
please also refer to the section entitled regulatory order and written agreement discussed earlier in the supervision and regulation section of item business of this form k 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting  documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
the federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution s noncompliance with one or more standards 
federal deposit insurance reform the fdic currently maintains the deposit insurance fund the dif  which was created in in the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund 
the deposit accounts of our subsidiary bank are insured by the dif to the maximum amount provided by law 
the general insurance limit is thousand  but for non interest bearing transaction accounts  there is unlimited insurance coverage until january  this insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by dif insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any dif insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the dif 
the fdic also has the authority to take enforcement actions against insured institutions 
the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories 
under the rules in effect through march   these rates are applied to the institution s deposits 
each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital  supervisory ratings and other factors 
well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to risk category i 
risk categories ii  iii and iv present progressively greater risks to the dif 
a range of initial base assessment rates applies to each risk category  subject to adjustments based on an institution s unsecured debt  secured liabilities and brokered deposits  such that the total base assessment rates after adjustments range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv 
as required by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  more fully described below  the fdic has adopted rules effective april   under which insurance premium assessments are based on an institution s total assets minus its tangible equity defined as tier capital instead of its deposits 
under these rules  an institution with total assets of less than billion will be assigned to a risk category as described above  and a range of initial base assessment rates will apply to each category  subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and  except for an institution in risk category i  adjustment upward if the institution s brokered deposits exceed of its domestic deposits  to produce total base assessment rates 
total base assessment rates range from to basis points for risk category i  to basis points for risk category ii  to basis points for risk category iii  and to basis points for risk category iv  all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another fdic insured institution 
the fdic may increase or decrease its rates by basis points without further rulemaking 
in an emergency  the fdic may also impose a special assessment 
for a bank that has had total assets of billion or more for four consecutive quarters  effective for assessments for the second quarter of and payable at the end of september  fdic regulations require the bank to be assessed quarterly for deposit insurance under a scorecard method 
the scorecard method uses a performance score and a loss severity score  which are combined and converted into an initial base assessment rate 
the performance score is based on measures of the bank s ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and weighted camels ratings 
the loss severity score is a measure of potential losses to the fdic in the event of the bank s failure 
under a formula  the performance score and loss severity score are combined and converted to a total score that determines the bank s initial base assessment rate 
the fdic has the discretion to alter the total score based on factors not captured by the scorecard 
the resulting initial base assessment rate is subject to adjustments downward based on long term unsecured debt issued by the bank  to adjustment upward based on long term unsecured debt held by the bank that is issued by other fdic insured institutions  and to further adjustment upward if the bank s brokered deposits exceed of its domestic deposits 
modifications to the scorecard method may apply to certain highly complex institutions 

table of contents in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement entered into with the fdic 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
on november   the fdic adopted regulations that required insured depository institutions to prepay on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and all of  and  along with their quarterly risk based assessment for the fourth quarter of because of its condition at the time  the bank was not required to pre pay any assessments 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the fdic has established as the designated reserve ratio drr  that is  the ratio of the dif to insured deposits 
the fdic has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum drr of by september   the deadline imposed by the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the statutory minimum drr to from the former statutory minimum of 
the fdic has not yet announced how it will implement this offset or how larger institutions will be affected by it 
on november  and january   the fdic as mandated by section of the dodd frank act adopted rules providing for unlimited deposit insurance for traditional noninterest bearing transaction accounts and iolta accounts for two years starting december  this coverage applies to all insured deposit institutions  and there is no separate fdic assessment for the insurance 
furthermore  this unlimited coverage is separate from  and in addition to  the coverage provided to depositors with respect to other accounts held at an insured depository institution 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act on july   president obama signed into law the sweeping financial regulatory reform act entitled the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act that implements significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry  including provisions that  among other things centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency within the federal reserve board  the bureau of consumer financial protection  with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts 
smaller financial institutions  including the bank  primarily will be subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws 
apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies 
require the fdic to seek to make its capital requirements for banks countercyclical so that the amount of capital required to be maintained increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction 
change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital 
implement corporate governance revisions  including executive compensation and proxy access by stockholders 

table of contents make permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of securities investor protection corporation protection from  to  and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until january  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions 
repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry more generally 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the company and the bank could require the company and the bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future 
financial services modernization legislation on november   the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act is intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks  insurance companies  the securities industry and other financial service providers 
it provides financial organizations with the flexibility of structuring such affiliations through a holding company structure or through a financial subsidiary of a bank  subject to certain limitations 
the financial services modernization act establishes a new type of bank holding company  known as a financial holding company  which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are financial in nature  which include securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the company has not sought financial holding company status and has no present plans to do so 
the financial services modernization act also sets forth a system of functional regulation that makes the federal reserve board the umbrella supervisor for holding companies  while providing for the supervision of the holding company s subsidiaries by other federal and state agencies 
in addition  the bank is subject to other provisions of the financial services modernization act  including those relating to the community reinvestment act  privacy and safe guarding confidential customer information  regardless of whether the company elects to become a financial holding company or to conduct activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company does not  however  currently intend to file notice with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company  the federal reserve board will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance  resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulatory agency of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
in its last reported examination by the fdic in  the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
the bank was examined for cra compliance in november   but has not received a final rating at this time 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about privacy policies that describe the conditions under which the institutions may disclose non public information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates 
in addition  financial institutions must provide annual privacy policy notices to current customers and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 

table of contents these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with affiliates 
the company and the bank do not believe that the financial services modernization act will have a material adverse effect on its operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company 
usa patriot act of on october   the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or the patriot act  of was signed into law 
among other things  the patriot act i prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  ii imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals  iii requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering compliance program  and iv eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records and to make rules to implement the patriot act 
on march   the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act was signed into law which extended and modified the original act 
while we believe the patriot act  as amended and reauthorized  may  to some degree  affect our operations  we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
transactions between affiliates transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve board issued regulation w on october  which comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
sections a and b and regulation w restrict loans by a depository institution to its affiliates  asset purchases by a depository institution from its affiliates and other transactions between a depository institution and its affiliates 
regulation w unifies in one public document the federal reserve board s interpretations of section a and b 
regulation w had an effective date of april  as the sole active subsidiary of the company  the bank s only affiliate transaction relationship under the auspices of the federal reserve act is its relationship with the company 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following loan transaction characteristics trigger coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 

table of contents in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them  unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
bank secrecy act and money laundering control act in  congress passed the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  otherwise known as the bank secrecy act the bsa  which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions 
the bsa was designed to help identify the source  volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the united states in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking  terrorism and other criminal activities 
the primary tool used to implement bsa requirements is the filing of suspicious activity reports 
today  the bsa requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions 
these programs must  at a minimum  provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance  provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance  designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training 
government actions in response to the financial crises emergency economic stabilization act in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets in recent years  the emergency economic stabilization act eesa was signed into law on october  and established the troubled asset relief program tarp 
as part of tarp  the united states department of the treasury treasury established the capital purchase program cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
in connection with eesa  there have been numerous actions by the frb  congress and the treasury  the fdic  the sec and others to further the economic and banking industry stabilization efforts under eesa 
it remains unclear at this time what further legislative and regulatory measures will be implemented under eesa affecting the company 
the company participated in the cpp and on march  issued and sold  shares of its series a preferred stock to treasury and issued a warrant for the purchase of  shares  in exchange for million 
for further details on the company s participation in the cpp  please see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements filed in this form k 
because of the company s participation in the cpp  it is subject to certain limitations on executive compensation and the payment of dividends 
american recovery and reinvestment act of on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
arra is intended to provide tax breaks for individuals and businesses  direct aid to distressed states and individuals and provide infrastructure spending 
in addition  arra imposes new executive compensation and expenditure limits on all previous and future tarp recipients and expands the class of employees to whom the limits and restrictions apply 
arra also provides the opportunity for additional repayment flexibility for existing tarp recipients 
among other things  arra prohibits the payment of bonuses  other incentive compensation and severance to certain highly paid employees except in the form of restricted stock subject to specified limitations and conditions and requires each tarp recipient to comply with certain other executive compensation related requirements 
these provisions modify the executive compensation provisions that were included in eesa and  in most instances  apply retroactively for so long as any obligation arising from financial assistance provided to the recipient under tarp remains outstanding 

table of contents in addition  arra directs the treasury to review previously paid bonuses  retention awards and other compensation paid to the senior executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees of each tarp recipient to determine whether any such payments were excessive  inconsistent with the purposes of arra or the tarp  or otherwise contrary to the public interest 
if the treasury determines that any such payments have been made by a tarp recipient  the treasury will seek to negotiate with the tarp recipient and the subject employee for appropriate reimbursements to the us government not the tarp recipient with respect to any such compensation or bonuses 
arra also permits the treasury  subject to consultation with the appropriate federal banking agency  to allow a tarp recipient to repay any assistance previously provided to such tarp recipient under the tarp  without regard to whether the tarp recipient has replaced such funds from any source  and without regard to any waiting period 
any tarp recipient that repays its tarp assistance pursuant to this provision would no longer be subject to the executive compensation provisions under arra 
future legislation and regulatory initiatives various other legislative and regulatory initiatives  including proposals to overhaul the banking regulatory system are from time to time introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as regulatory agencies 
future legislation regarding financial institutions may change banking statutes  the operating environment of the company and the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted 
if enacted  the effect of implementing regulations could impact positively or negatively  the financial condition or results of operations of the company and or the bank 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions is unpredictable at this time 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation  if enacted  would have upon its financial condition or operations

risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents risks associated with our business our banking subsidiary is operating under a consent order with the fdic and dfi and the company is operating under a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco to address  among other things  lending  credit and capital related issues 
in light of the challenging operating environment  along with our elevated level of non performing assets  delinquencies and adversely classified assets  we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and additional regulatory restrictions and became subject to certain enforcement actions under a consent order issued by the fdic and dfi to the bank on march  and written agreement with the federal reserve board entered into on march  these enforcement actions followed the fdic s regularly scheduled examination of our banking subsidiary during the fourth quarter of and are based on discussions the bank had with its examiners following the examination 
such enforcement actions place limitations on our business and may adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans 
these enforcement actions require  among other things  the bank to take certain steps to strengthen its balance sheet  such as reducing the level of classified assets  increasing capital levels and addressing other criticisms of the examination 
these enforcement actions are more fully discussed in supervision and regulation regulatory order and written agreement and note regulatory order and written agreement  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k 
if the company fails to comply with these enforcement actions  it may become subject to further regulatory enforcement actions up to and including the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank 
the regulatory agencies have the authority to restrict our operations to those consistent with adequately capitalized institutions 
for example  the regulatory agencies have imposed restrictions that place limitations on our lending activities and our ability to complete acquisitions 
the regulatory agencies also have the power to limit the rates paid by the bank to attract retail deposits in its local markets 
although we have been able to reduce the overall level of classified assets  the level still remains elevated as compared to our long term experience and exposes us to increased lending risk 
further  if our allowance for loan losses is insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio  our earnings may decline if the level of loans the bank currently categorizes as substandard and doubtful do not perform according to their terms and or the underlying collateral for such loans is insufficient to cover the bank s recorded investment  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb potential losses 
this could result in additional loan losses which may adversely impact our operating results 
further  although we have made strides in resolving the level of classified assets in the last year  our level of remaining classified assets will still take time to resolve 
while we believe that we are making progress in identifying and resolving classified assets  no assurance can be given that we will continue to make progress  particularly if the local economies in which we operate suffer further deterioration 
we believe that the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable  estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of such borrowers making payments  as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in additions to our allowance 
our regulators  as an integral part of their regular examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs 
any additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on real estate and any further downturn in the real estate market may hurt our business a significant portion of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate 
although we have seen  what we believe are the early signs of stabilization in the local economies in which we operate  a renewed decline in economic conditions  the local housing market or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans or the value of real estate owned by us  any combination of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
in addition  a large portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate that is subject to risks related to acts of nature  including earthquakes  floods and fires 
to the extent that these events occur  they may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans  which may also negatively impact our financial condition 

table of contents we have a concentration in higher risk commercial real estate loans we have a high concentration in commercial real estate cre loans 
cre loans  as defined by final guidance issued by bank regulators  are defined as construction  land development  other land loans  loans secured by multi family or more units residential properties and loans secured by non farm non residential properties 
following this definition  approximately of our lending portfolio can be classified as cre lending as of december  cre loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than certain other types of lending due  among other things  to the generally large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt 
cash flow may be adversely affected by general economic conditions  which may result in non performance by certain borrowers 
additionally  federal banking regulators recently issued final guidance regarding commercial real estate lending 
this guidance suggests that institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
institutions that have experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate lending or are approaching or exceed certain supervisory criteria that measure an institution s commercial real estate portfolio against its capital levels  may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny because of our commercial real estate portfolio and  as a result  the bank developed and implemented a plan to systematically reduce the amount of loans within this category as required in the consent order issued to the bank on march  liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in general 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations  but our consent order and written agreement prohibit the payment of such dividends without prior regulatory approval which may impair our ability to fulfill our obligations as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities  our preferred stock and other obligations  including any cash dividends 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
as outlined in the consent order and written agreement  previously mentioned  the bank cannot pay any cash dividends or other payments to the holding company without prior written consent of the regulatory authorities 
additionally  the company cannot declare or pay any dividends including those on outstanding preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program or make any distributions of principal  interest or other sums on its trust preferred securities without prior written approval of the federal reserve 
if we defer six dividend payments  the us treasury will have the right to appoint two directors to our board 
as of december   we had deferred payments 
the treasury has assigned an observer to our board of directors  but to date we have not been notified of their intent to appoint directors to our board 
the recent recession and changes in domestic and foreign financial markets have adversely affected our industry and may have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition the recent recession has resulted in significant business failures and job losses 
further  dramatic declines in the housing market with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant losses to many financial institutions 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and volatility in the financial markets may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
although we believe we have seen the early signs of stabilization in these conditions in our local market  these challenging conditions may not improve or may again begin to deteriorate in the near future and we may face the following risks as a result increased regulation of our industry  compliance with which may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 

table of contents the value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected 
higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot accurately predict the effect of the current economic downturn on our future results of operations or market price of our stock the national economy and the financial services sector in particular remain challenged with weakness in the broader economy despite high levels of government stimulus 
we cannot accurately predict the severity or duration of the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted the markets we serve 
any further deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business  financial condition  results of operations  prospects and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline 
financial reform legislation will  among other things  tighten capital standards  create a new consumer financial protection bureau and result in new regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
this law significantly changes the current bank regulatory structure and affects the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
among the many requirements in the dodd frank act for new banking regulations is a requirement for new capital regulations to be adopted within months 
these regulations must be at least as stringent as  and may call for higher levels of capital than  current regulations 
generally  trust preferred securities will no longer be eligible as tier capital  but the company s currently outstanding trust preferred securities will be grandfathered and its currently outstanding tarp preferred securities will continue to qualify as tier capital 
in addition  the fdic  along with other federal bank regulators  is required to seek to make its capital requirements for the banks it regulates  such as the bank  countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act are expected to have a near term impact on us 
for example  one year after the date of its enactment  the dodd frank act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
the dodd frank act also broadened the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution and are generally expected to increase for institutions having total assets in excess of billion 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts and iolta accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  in addition  the dodd frank act increased the authority of the federal reserve board to examine the company and its non bank subsidiaries and gave the federal reserve board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for an electronic debit transaction by a payment card issuer that  together with its affiliates  has assets of billion or more  and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer 
by regulation  the federal reserve board has limited the fees for such a transaction to the sum of cents plus five basis points times the value of the transaction  plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs 
while this rule does not apply to us directly because our asset size is less than billion  such limits place practical limitations in the financial services marketplace on such fees 
the dodd frank act also restricts proprietary trading by banks  bank holding companies and others  and their acquisition and retention of ownership interests in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds  subject to an exception allowing a bank to organize and offer hedge funds and private equity funds to customers if certain conditions are met  including  among others  a requirement that the bank limit its ownership interest in any single fund to and its aggregate investment in all funds to of tier capital  with no director or employee of the bank holding an ownership interest in the fund unless he or she provides services directly to the funds 

table of contents the dodd frank act created a bureau of consumer financial protection the cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than billion in assets 
the cfpb is beginning to issue rules and regulations  among them examination procedures for mortgage loan originators 
it is not yet known the extent to which the regulatory activities of the cfpb will impact our results of operations and financial condition 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company 
however  compliance with this law and its implementing regulations has resulted  and will continue to result  in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
for additional discussion of the dodd frank act  see item business supervision and regulation the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the downgrade of the us credit rrating and europe s debt crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and liquidity 
standard poor s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america from aaa to aa on august  a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
any such adverse impact could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our investment securities are issued by us government agencies and us government sponsored entities 
in addition  the possibility that certain european union eu member states will default on their debt obligations have negatively impacted economic conditions and global markets 
the continued uncertainty over the outcome of international and the eu s financial support programs and the possibility that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles could further disrupt global markets 
the negative impact on economic conditions and global markets could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
fdic deposit insurance assessments may increase substantially which would adversely affect our net earnings although changes to the fdic deposit insurance assessment base rate calculation reduced the level of insurance paid in to million from the million paid in these levels still remain elevated due to the existence of the regulatory order and written agreement 
although the company currently expects the level of deposit insurance premiums to decline over  they remain elevated as compared to pre recession levels  which will impact future operating results 
declines in the value of our investment portfolio securities may result in impairment charges and may adversely affect our financial performance and capital we maintain an investment portfolio that includes  but is not limited to  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and corporate bonds 
although we have seen an improvement in the overall market value of our investment portfolio in  the market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the last few years  largely due to disruptions in the capital markets 
the market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities  or the mortgages underlying the securities  such as ratings downgrades  adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities 
furthermore  problems at the federal and state government levels may trickle down to municipalities and adversely impact our investment in municipal bonds 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment 
we may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other than temporary 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to charge the credit related portion of the other than temporary impairment against earnings  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charges occur 
for a more detailed discussion of investments the company holds  including other than temporary impairment recognized during  please see note investments  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k 

table of contents our business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance and financial condition our earnings and cash flows are highly dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
our net interest income including net interest spread and margin and overall earnings are impacted by changes in interest rates and monetary policy 
changes in interest rates and monetary policy can impact the demand for new loans  the credit profile of our borrowers  the yields earned on loans and securities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the company s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the company s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the company s balance sheet is slightly liability sensitive 
this means that until such time as a substantial portion of the company s variable rate loan portfolio returns to rates above their floor levels  the company would expect all other things being equal to experience a contraction in its net interest income if rates rise and conversely to experience expansion in net interest income  if rates fall 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates such as a sudden and substantial increase in prime and overnight fed funds rates as well as increasing competition may require the bank to increase rates on deposits at a faster pace than the increase in the rate it earns on interest earning assets 
the impact of any sudden and substantial move in interest rates and or increased competition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as the bank s net interest income including the net interest spread and margin may be negatively impacted 
additionally  a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to prepay existing higher rate  fixed rate loans by refinancing to lower interest rates loan 
under those circumstances  we may not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans 
failure to successfully execute our strategy may adversely affect our performance our financial performance and profitability depends on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long term financial performance goals include those stated elsewhere in this section  as well as inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee compensation costs  regulatory compliance  healthcare cost  limitations imposed on us in the consent order and or written agreement  inability to increase non interest income and continuing ability to expand  through de novo branching or identifying acquisition targets at attractive valuation levels 
we face strong competition from financial service and other companies that offer banking service which may adversely impact our business the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition in attracting and retaining core business relationships 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share  decrease loan demand  cause the prices we charge for our services to fall  result in a decline in the rates we charge on loans and or cause higher rates to be paid on deposits 
therefore  our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature and level of competition 
additionally  technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 

table of contents the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them without offering very high compensation 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
because of our participation in the troubled asset relief program tarp  we are subject to several restrictions  including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance apply to us for the period during which the us treasury holds an equity position in us 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include  among other things  ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required claw back of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes  executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation may increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
pursuant to the arra  more commonly known as the economic stimulus recovery package  further compensation restrictions  including significant limitations on incentive compensation  have been imposed on our senior executive officers and most highly compensated employees 
such restrictions and any future restrictions on executive compensation  which may be adopted  could adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified senior executive officers 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks we are subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
we maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
information systems we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 

table of contents we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  the central coast of california is subject to earthquakes and fires 
operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities 
while we have not experienced such an occurrence to date  other severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on third party service providers for key systems the company uses a third party software service provider to perform all of its transaction data processing 
the company also outsources other customer service applications  such as on line banking  ach and wire transfers  to third party vendors 
if these service providers were to experience technical difficulties or incur any extended outages in services  it could have an adverse impact on the company and its customers 
further  if the company was required to switch service providers due to deterioration in service quality or other factors  there is no guarantee that it could obtain comparable services for a comparable price 
we are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance we are a community bank  and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business 
as such  we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation 
this is done  in part  by recruiting  hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve  delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates 
if our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees  or otherwise  our business and  therefore  our operating results may be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to government regulation that may limit or restrict our activities which may adversely impact our operations the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or repeal of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our business 
we anticipate that continued compliance with various regulatory provisions will impact future operating expenses 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects economic conditions which may impact the bank 
new legislative and regulatory proposals may affect our operations and growth proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and financial institutions and federal insurance premiums paid by banks and financial institutions and companies that control such institutions are frequently raised in the us congress  state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities 
the likelihood of any major changes in the future and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine 
similarly  proposals to change the accounting treatment applicable to banks and other depository institutions are frequently raised by the sec  the federal banking agencies  the irs and other appropriate authorities 
the likelihood and impact of any additional future changes in law or regulation and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine at this time 

table of contents risks associated with our stock our participation in the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp may pose certain risks to holders of our common stock under the terms of the cpp  the company sold to the us treasury million in preferred stock and a warrant to purchase approximately million of the company s common stock 
although the company believes that its participation in the cpp is in the best interests of our shareholders in that it enhances company and bank capital and provides additional funds for future growth  it may pose certain risks to the holders of our common stock such as the following under the terms outlined by the us treasury for participants in the cpp  the company issued a warrant to the u 
s treasury to purchase shares of its common stock 
the issuance of this warrant may be dilutive to current common stockholders in that it reduces earnings per common share 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the us treasury has the right to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which would result in an approximate ownership interest 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction and therefore has the ability to become a shareholder of the company and possess voting power 
the preferred equity issued to the us treasury is non voting  however  the terms of the cpp stipulate that the us treasury may vote its senior equity in matters deemed by the us treasury to have an impact on its holdings 
the purchase agreement between the company and the u 
s treasury provides that before the earlier of march  and the date on which all of the shares of the preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without consent of the us treasury  a increase the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share  the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october  or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the preferred stock 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant issued to the us treasury  may have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
although the company does not foresee any material changes to the terms associated with its participation in the cpp  the us government  as a sovereign body  may at any time change the terms of our participation in the cpp and or significantly influence company policy 
for more information about the company s participation in the cpp  see note preferred stock  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k 
our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share and may be dilutive to common stockholders accrued dividends and the accretion on our outstanding preferred stock reduce net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
additionally  our series c preferred stock may be dilutive to common stockholders to the extent the company is profitable and must consider the dilutive nature of these securities in its calculation of earnings per common share 
also  the company s preferred stock will receive preferential treatment in the event of the company s liquidation  dissolution or winding down 
our stock trades less frequently than others although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial service companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 

table of contents our stock price is affected by a variety of factors stock price volatility may make it more difficult for investors to resell their common stock when they want and at prices they find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors discussed in this section  including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  and perceptions in the marketplace regarding our company and or its competitors and the industry in which we operate 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent shareholders from selling their common stock at or above the price they paid 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
any future issuance of preferred or common stock adversely affect the market price of our common stock we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
we frequently evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets  taking into account our regulatory capital ratios  financial condition and other relevant considerations

any future issuances of equity may result in additional common shares outstanding and or reduce the amount of income available to common shareholders 
in addition  we face significant regulatory and other governmental risk as a financial institution and as a participant in the cpp and it is possible that capital requirements and directives may  in the future  require us to change the amount or composition of our current capital including common equity 
as a result we may determine we need  or our regulators may require us to raise additional capital 
there may also be market perceptions regarding the capital we raised in or the need to raise additional capital  which may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders we have supported our continued growth through two issuances of trust preferred securities from two separate special purpose trusts  one of which was dissolved in at december   we had million of trust preferred securities outstanding 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these special purpose trusts are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
further  the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the special purpose trusts are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years during which time no cash dividends may be paid on our common stock 
our common stock is not an insured deposit our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may hinder a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for the years ended december   and the analysis should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview executive summary of operating results for the year ended december   the company reported net income of approximately million or per share on a fully diluted basis 
this compares to a net loss of million or per common share for and a net loss of million or per common share for the improvement in earnings is largely due to lower loan loss provision expense as compared to the prior two years  as well as the reversal of a portion of the million valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets that was established in the latter half of the provision for loan loss decreased to million from the provisions recorded in and of million and million  respectively 
the lower provisioning requirements in were driven by overall improvements in the credit quality of the loan portfolio and lower net charge offs  whereas and were two of the most challenging years in the company s history 
of the million of provisions recorded in  million was attributable to loan sales that were executed to reduce the level of classified and non performing assets in absent the provisions driven by the loan sales  the provision required to cover the net impact of both improved credits and newly identified credit downgrades during would have been million 
the reduced level of provisioning reflects improving trends in credit quality as evidenced by the decline in our historical loss rates  in particular over the company s allowance for loan losses declined to of gross loans receivable from at the end of the decline was due to an improvement in the overall credit profile of the company  including reduced levels of classified and non performing loans  management aggressively addressing credit problems during through work out processes and the sale of pools of classified and non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased as a percentage of non performing loans to at december  from at december   again reflecting the steps that the company took to reduce the level of non performing assets in the other key contributor to the improvement in earnings in was the reversal of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in as compared to the million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance established in the partial reversal of allowance in reflected the impacts of numerous factors  such as improvements in earnings and credit quality that provided adequate positive evidence that million of deferred tax asset for which a valuation allowance had been previously established were now more likely than not recognizable as future tax benefits 
see note income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k for a more detailed discussion of the accounting for the company s deferred tax valuation allowance 
operating results for were also favorably impacted by decreases in non interest expense levels  which were million lower than the primary reduction in non interest expense was due to a million reduction in the level of write downs on foreclosed assets 
the balance of the expense reduction was attributable to a combination of reductions in salary and benefit costs and regulatory assessment costs 
the favorable impacts from reductions in non interest expense were partially offset by declines in non interest income of million 
the decline in non interest income was largely due to a one time gain on the extinguishment of debt  totaling million  which was recognized in the second quarter of related to retirement of junior subordinated debentures  and the net impact in of a million increase in losses recognized on the sale of foreclosed asset  partially offset by a million increase in gains realized on the sale of investment securities 
please see non interest income  and non interest expense under results of operations  below  for additional information related to these components of operating income 
the company believes that the operating results for better reflect the core earnings of the company relative to the earnings in and  which were adversely impacted by the credit issues brought on by the recent financial crisis and resulting national recession 
these trends are not only a result of what appears to be the first signs of some degree of stabilization in the local economies in which the company operates  but also from improvements realized in asset quality through a combination of sales of classified assets and improvement in credit quality during the year 

table of contents the improvements in asset quality since december  are evidenced by the million decline in classified assets  the million decline in impaired loans  the improvement in the coverage of the allowance for loan loss as a percentage of non performing loans to from at december  the decline in special mention risk graded loan balances from million at december  to million at december   the decline in oreo balances outstanding from million at december  to million at december  while the company is cautiously optimistic about the current positive trends in credit quality that we have experienced in  it is unclear as to how the uncertainties in the global economy could impact the local economy  if at all

estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans  the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets and estimates used in the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments 
allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the value of foreclosed real estate  management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and foreclosed real estate and collateral  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
because of these factors  it is reasonably possible that the allowance for loan losses and foreclosed real estate may change in future periods 
see also note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements filed in this form k 
realizability of deferred tax assets the company uses an estimate of its future earnings in determining if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of its deferred tax assets will be realized over the period they are expected to reverse 
if based on all available evidence  the company believes that a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance may be established 
during  the company established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
based on the company s ongoing assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets  it reduced the level of valuation allowance in see also note income taxes  of the consolidated financial statements filed in this form k 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of observable pricing and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no observable pricing and a higher degree of judgment is utilized in measuring the fair value of such instruments 
observable pricing is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction

results of operations net interest income and margin net interest income  the primary component of the net earnings of a financial institution  refers to the difference between the interest paid on deposits and borrowings  and the interest earned on loans and investments 
the net interest margin is the amount of net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
factors considered in the analysis of net interest income are the composition and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amount of non interest bearing liabilities  non accruing loans  and changes in market interest rates 

table of contents the table below sets forth average balance sheet information  interest income and expense  average yields and rates and net interest income and margin for the years ended december   and the average balance of non accruing loans has been included in loan totals

loan fees of   for the years ending december    and respectively have been included in interest income computation 
net interest margin has been calculated by dividing the net interest income by total average earning assets 

table of contents discussion of compared to at december   average earning assets were approximately million lower than that reported at december  this decline was driven by a million reduction in the level of net loans outstanding  due in large part to million of loan sales completed in including the impacts of the million of loans transferred to held for sale status at december  and subsequently sold in january  and million decline in interest bearing funds due from banks  both of which were partially offset by an increase in investment securities  which increased by million over the decline in the overall average earning assets and the change in mix between loans and investment securities were the primary factors contributing to the decline in interest income and yield in  as higher yielding loans that were sold or paid down in  were replaced by lower yielding investment securities 
we continued to experience tepid loan demand through most of  which when combined with increased competition for quality lending opportunities has contributed to the contraction in the loan portfolio in  as customer pay down activity and the sale of classified and non performing loans has outpaced new loan production 
however  we began to see an increase in loan demand at year end which we anticipate will continue in yields on the loan portfolio in were essentially flat compared to  as the impacts of originating and renewing loans in the current historically low interest rate environment  which placed some level of downward pressure on rates  were substantially offset by a reduction in the level of non performing loans 
total forgone interest on impaired loans including interest reversed when a loan is initially placed on non accrual and all interest income lost prospectively was approximately million for  impacting the yield on earning assets by approximately basis points  a decline of million and basis points from at december   average interest bearing liabilities decreased million as compared to december  the decline was largely caused by a reduction in the level of federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  which declined million and time deposits  which declined million 
time deposits and fhlb borrowings tend to be the higher cost elements of our interest bearing liabilities  therefore the decline in such balances led to a significant decline in the amount of interest expense and the cost associated with our interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense declined million from to million in and the average rate declined basis points to 
as a result of the interplay of the above factors  we realized an increase in both net interest income and net interest margin in as compared to discussion of compared to at december   average interest earning assets were approximately million higher than that reported for the year ended december  higher average balances of investment securities stemming from the million in net proceeds the company received from its march private placement  coupled with an increase in average core deposit balances led to the year over year increase in average interest earning assets 
although the increase in investment balances ultimately contributed to a year over year increase in interest income  the lower yields earned on these investments  due in large part to the current lower interest rate environment  contributed to a decline in earning asset yields in during  the company transferred million in loans to non accrual status  which resulted in interest reversals of million  contributing to the year over year decline in interest and fees earned on loans as compared to furthermore  average impaired loan balances in were approximately million higher than that reported for  which placed additional pressure on loan portfolio yields in total forgone interest on impaired loans including interest reversed when a loan is initially placed on non accrual and all interest income lost prospectively totaled approximately million for  impacting the yield on earning assets by approximately basis points 
for forgone interest totaled million and impacted the yield on earning assets by basis points 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million in from the million reported at december  the year over year increase can be attributed to higher average balances of core interest bearing deposits  including increases in money market and time deposit accounts  which resulted from promotional activities and added focus on attracting and retaining core relationships 
the yield on interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   representing a decline of basis points 
in an effort to augment the decline in earning asset yields and reduce pressure on the net interest margin  the company lowered offering rates significantly during the latter half of as a result  the company significantly reduced the cost of money market and time deposits during additionally  the company restructured and paid down higher cost fhlb borrowings during  contributing to the decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
further  in june the company eliminated million in junior subordinated debentures from the balance sheet  associated with the repurchase of trust preferred securities issued by heritage oaks capital trust iii 
these borrowings previously accrued interest at a rate of per annum 

table of contents the lower overall yield on the loan portfolio  coupled with an increase in lower yielding investment securities in resulted in lower earning asset yields  which more than offset savings realized by reducing the cost of our deposit base  leading to a year over year decline in the net interest margin in as compared to the following table sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in interest rates for the three years ended december   and for the year ended  for the year ended  for the year ended  december  december  december  dollar amounts in thousands volume rate total volume rate total volume rate total interest income investments with other banks interest bearing due from federal funds sold investment securities taxable investment securities non taxable taxable equivalent adjustment loans net decrease increase interest expense savings  now  money market time deposits other borrowings federal funds purchased long term borrowings net decrease increase total net increase decrease adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of provision for loan losses as more fully discussed in note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k  the allowance for loan losses has been established by management in order to provide for those loans  which for a variety of reasons  may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable losses during the holding period of the loan and is based on methodologies applied on a consistent basis with the prior year 
management s review of the adequacy of the allowance includes  among other things  an analysis of past loan loss experience and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will likely vary from current estimates 
the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s best estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable estimable losses in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of loans identified as non performing 
for additional information see the allowance for loan losses discussion in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents discussion of compared to the company s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million as compared to that reported in the decrease in the provisions for loan losses can be attributed to a deceleration in the amount of required provisions due to efforts taken to date to identify and address potential credit issues  a decrease in the amount of classified and non performing loans through structured problem loan sales executed in and the overall improving quality of the loan portfolio  as evidenced by the improvements in the loss history over the last year  enhanced procedures around the issuance of new credit over the last couple of years and early signs that the local economies  in which it operates  may be stabilizing after a prolonged period of recession and stagnant recovery  based on recent reports on improved unemployment levels and modest upward trends in commercial real estate leasing activity 
discussion of compared to provisions for loan losses in were million higher than that reported for  which is reflective of additional credit losses the company incurred during as well as continued weakness in economic conditions

see also note borrowings  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k for additional discussion concerning the extinguishment of these borrowings 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in gains and fees attributable to mortgage sales  reflecting lower demand for new and refinance mortgages over most of the year 
although the volume of mortgages funded in was lower than  with the decline in mortgage rates in the second half of the  which fell to new historical levels  and incremental staff being added to the mortgage team  mortgage funding levels increased in the second half of as compared to the first half of the year 
lastly  we experienced an increase in the level of loss on the sale of other real estate owned  as we dramatically reduced the level of foreclosed assets through the sales of such properties  as part of our strategy to reduce non earning assets in partially offsetting these declines in non interest income was a million increase in gains on sales of investment securities  as the investment portfolio in whole returned to a net unrealized gain position and securities were sold  as part of our strategy to change the overall mix of the portfolio in an effort to improve the total return on invested funds  yielded higher gains 
discussion of compared to the majority of the of the increase in non interest income in as compared to was attributable to a million one time gain realized on the extinguishment of million of subordinated debt 
in addition  we realized a million increase in gain and fee income from the sale of mortgages  as the historically low interest environment resulted in renewed activity in the refinance markets for home mortgages 
this in conjunction with further expansion of the mortgage origination team led to increased volume in and consequently higher fee income 

table of contents the other factors that contributed to the variance in non interest income in as compared to included an increase in debit credit card transaction and interchange fee income of million or in the company attributes this growth to an increase in related transactions as well as additional core deposit relationships the bank obtained during the increase in gain on sale of investment securities of million was largely consistent with improvements in the overall performance of the investment portfolio and the investment market in general 
lastly  we realized a nominal gain on the sale of other real estate owned in as compared to the million loss in partially offsetting these favorable changes was a decline in service charges and fee income of million or in management believes the decline within this category can be attributed to better cash management practices by business customers in an effort to control costs in the difficult economic environment

for the years ended december   and the total number of full time equivalent employees were  and  respectively 
discussion of compared to the million reduction in salaries and employee benefits in was largely due to a million reduction in commission expense in part due to decline in the level of mortgages underwritten in  as well as  the implementation of new compensation plans put in place in  a million reduction in bonus compensation due to the elimination of bonuses in pending the lifting of the order and written agreement  a reduction of million due to the establishment of an accrual for compensated absences during the third quarter of  and reductions in other benefit costs of million due to changes in plan benefits  refunds received from the benefit providers as part of their commitment to limit medical benefit costs and the percentage of employer contribution for those benefits 
discussion of compared to the million year over year increase can be attributed to further expansion of the company s management team and special assets department in an effort to address the requirements of the order and written agreement 
additionally  during the company incurred a one time charge of million to update its accrual for compensated absences  contributing further to the year over year increase 

table of contents occupancy and equipment discussion of compared to occupancy costs in  declined modestly largely due to the closure of one of our smallest branches in as part of our goal to improve operating efficiency and due to refunds of previously paid property taxes based on approved petitions to reduce the assessed value of the properties the company owns and leases 
discussion of compared to the million increase within this category can be attributed to an increase in depreciation expense associated with various leasehold improvements and equipment purchases  higher property tax costs  increased licensing costs associated with various process improvement initiatives throughout the organization  and a decline in sublease rental income resulting from the relocation on one branch office during late fdic and other regulatory fees discussion of compared to the decrease in regulatory assessment costs in of million was largely due to a revision to the assessment calculation that went into effect during however  the rates remain elevated due in part to the fdic s overall increase in rates to help replenish the deposit insurance fund and increased assessments due to the regulatory order 
discussion of compared to for the year ended december   regulatory assessment costs increased million over that reported for the bank s deposit insurance assessment rates increased during in part because of the regulatory order and due to an increase by the fdic in assessment rates 
amortization of intangible assets amortization consists primarily of core deposit intangible amortization for the hacienda acquisition in october and the business first national bank acquisition in october the level of amortization is determined pursuant to an analysis prepared by a third party at the time of acquisition to determine the fair value of deposits acquired in accordance with us gaap and which is updated  if needed by changes in projected run off rates of acquired core deposits 
discussion of compared to the decrease in amortization in of million was largely due to modest declines in the level of amortization from the business first bank core deposit intangible 
discussion of compared to the decrease in amortization in of million was largely due to the hacienda portion of the core deposit intangible becoming fully amortized in director fees discussion of compared to the decrease in fees in of million was due to a decline in the level of fees paid to the chairman of the board of directors 
discussion of compared to the increase in fees in was primarily due to increased oversight by the bank and company s board pursuant to the terms of the consent order  which resulted in increased fees paid to the chairman of the board  and to an increase in the total number of board members 

table of contents write downs of foreclosed assets discussion of compared to the decrease in oreo valuation adjustments in of million was due to the fact that much of the write down on oreo inventory that existed at december  occurred in in  most of the oreo inventory was liquidated in conjunction with the company s strategy to reduce non performing assets  which when combined with lower levels of new additions to oreo in  resulted in a decline in the level of valuation allowance provisioning in see also note other real estate owned  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k 
discussion of compared to marked the peak of foreclosure activity and therefore the level of foreclosed asset holdings dramatically increased in in conjunction with this increased foreclosure activity  the company continued to refine the value of the foreclosed assets throughout the year  as new appraisal information became available on the value of the collateral  resulting in increased levels of write downs during the provision for income taxes the amount of the tax provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income  adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
such permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt municipal interest income and earnings on bank owned life insurance 
for  the company recorded a tax provision of million 
for the years ended december  and the company recorded an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
during the company established a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax assets of million as of december  the establishment of this valuation allowance resulted in a reduction in the income tax benefit the company recorded in  which would have been before the impact of the valuation allowance adjustment 
in  the company reassessed the level of valuation allowance required against its deferred tax assets and determined that based on the return to profitability over all four quarters of  as well as the company s ability to forecast positive earnings for the foreseeable future that million of the valuation allowance could be reversed 
as a result  the income tax provision for was reduced by million  thereby lowering the effective tax rate for exclusive of the reversal of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance  the effective tax rate would have been 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted significantly by the substantial provisions the bank made to the allowance for loan losses during those years  significantly reducing pre tax income

financial condition the company saw an improvement in its overall financial condition in a discussion of each of the key elements of our financial condition follows loans impact of market condition on lending despite the recent signs of some stabilization in the local economies  in which it operates  loan demand remained tepid for the much of  which was the primary factor in the contraction in the loan portfolio during and it should be noted that near year end loan demand appeared to be increasing 
we anticipate this trend to continue into the secondary factor that contributed to the decline in net loans was million of problem loan sales  which occurred during the year 
although the company believes that it may be starting to see some signs of stabilization in the local economies in which it operates  the company realizes that a renewed decline in the national  state and local economies may further impact local borrowers  as well as the values of real estate within our market footprint used to secure certain loans 
as such  management continues to closely monitor credit trends and leading indicators for additional signs of deterioration 
the bank employs stringent lending standards and remains very selective with regard to loan originations  including commercial real estate  real estate construction  land and commercial loans that it chooses to originate  in an effort to effectively manage risk in this difficult credit environment 
the company has devoted considerable resources to monitoring credit in order to take appropriate steps when and if necessary to mitigate any material adverse impacts on the company 

table of contents credit quality the company s primary business is the extension of credit to individuals and businesses and safekeeping of customers deposits 
the company s policies concerning the extension of credit require risk analyses including an extensive evaluation of the purpose for the loan request and the borrower s ability and willingness to repay the bank as agreed 
the company also considers other factors when evaluating whether or not to extend new credit to a potential borrower 
these factors include the current level of diversification in the loan portfolio and the impact that funding a new loan will have on that diversification  legal lending limit constraints and any regulatory limitations concerning the extension of certain types of credit 
the credit quality of the loan portfolio is impacted by numerous factors including the economic environment in the markets the company operates  which can have a direct impact on the value of real estate securing collateral dependent loans 
weak economic conditions have also impacted certain borrowers the company has extended credit to  making it difficult for those borrowers to continue to make timely repayment on their loans 
an inability of certain borrowers to continue to perform under the original terms of their respective loan agreements in conjunction with declines in real estate collateral values may result in increases in provisions for loan losses that have an adverse impact on the company s operating results

table of contents at december   real estate secured balances were million or million lower than that reported at december  the year over year decrease can be attributed to decreases across substantially all segments of the real estate secured loan portfolio  except commercial real estate  which experienced a net increase of million 
the primary factor behind the increase in commercial real estate can be attributed to transfers from the construction segment upon project completion and new loans issued  net of pay downs  totaling million  which were partially offset by a million reduction due to the problem loan sales  million of loans transferred to oreo and million in loan charge offs on non performing loans  during the increase in secured commercial loans was partially offset by declines in farmland loans due to the pay off of a large loan and other net pay downs totaling million and the sale of a million loan  and in residential family loans due in part to the sale of a million loan as part of the problem loan sales in  while the balance of the year to date change was due to pay downs and pay offs  net of new loans issued during home equity lines of credit increased approximately million due to new net line draws of million  partially offset by charge offs and transfers to oreo totaling million

as a result of these factors  the ratio of total construction loan balances  including undisbursed commitments  to risk based capital declined from at december  to at december  construction loans are typically granted for a one year period and then converted into permanent loans which typically have amortization terms of not more than years  with to year maturities 
all loans the bank originates that are considered construction or for acquisition and development are monitored by a construction budget 
draw requests are aligned with monthly projections and reviewed against documents submitted by the borrower 
in addition a third party construction inspector conducts regular on site visits to the project site and provides a written report comparing the loan balance to work completed  budget accuracy  as well as the adequacy of funds left to disburse against the remaining costs to complete the project 
as part of its ongoing monitoring of acquisition and development loans  the bank periodically evaluates the appropriateness of continued use of interest reserves 
various factors are considered by the bank when determining the continued use of an interest reserve with focus placed on certain red flags during the life cycle of acquisition and development projects acquisition  development  and construction 
such red flags are designed to alert the bank to potential significant delays or execution risk for the overall project  which would indicate that continued use of an interest reserve is not appropriate  and include such things as the borrower s delay  neglect  or failure to perform appropriate engineering and environmental studies  prepare site plans  submit formal applications to relevant planning and zoning authorities  subdivide  level  or grade the site  build out required site improvements  and properly manage the construction phase of the project 
as of december  there were a total of six loans with interest reserves 
the aggregate interest reserve balance associated with these loans was million as of december   compared to the million reported at december  the differences in underwriting practices for loans with interest reserves versus those without interest reserves are nominal 
construction and development loans are underwritten by examining the various financial and environmental factors specific to the project in need of financing 
the viability of the project is then assessed against the financial strength of the sponsor guarantor and their historical track record of performance 
this process is essentially the same whether the proposed loan will include an interest reserve or not

the bank typically grants such loans to borrowers within the bank s primary market area 
loans held for sale loans held for sale primarily consist of mortgage originations that have already been specifically designated for sale pursuant to correspondent mortgage loan investor agreements 
there is minimal interest rate risk associated with these loans as purchase commitments are in place with investors at the time the company funds them 
settlement from the correspondents is typically within to days of funding the mortgage 
at december   mortgage correspondent loans loans held for sale totaled approximately million  million more than that reported at december  the increase in mortgage correspondent loans in is largely due to mortgage rates falling to new historic lows in the second half of and increases in sales staffing in the mortgage department  both of which has resulted in an increased volume of mortgages written and subsequently sold 
in addition to the mortgage correspondent loans  the company also had million of loans  primarily commercial real estate loans that were under contract for sale as of december   which subsequently closed in mid january prior to transferring the loans to held for sale  the company charged them down from their book balance at the time the sale was negotiated of million to their fair value as evidenced by the sales agreement price of million

the decline in the allowance also reflects improvements in the level of special mention risk graded loans in  due to the improvement in the credit quality of several large borrowers and the workout of credit issues on other loans 
during  the company has also experienced some stabilization in both general economic conditions and real estate valuations  and a reduced level of new transfers of loans to non performing status  which when combined with the sale of non performing loans in has resulted in a decline in the overall allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan loss allocated to the commercial real estate segment of the portfolio declined by million from million at december  to million at december  this decline was driven primarily in an improvement in the level of classified loans in the commercial real estate segment  which fell by from million at december  to million at december  the c i segment of the loan portfolio was the other segment that experienced a major decline in its allocation in the allowance for loan losses 
this allowance for loan loss allocation declined by million from million at december  to million at december  this decline was driven primarily by an improvement in the level of classified loans in the c i segment which fell by from million at december  to million at december  the decline in the c i portion of the portfolio was also driven by improvements in the historical loss history during  which factors into the determination of the general reserve component of the allowance for loan loss 
the allocation of allowance for loan loss related to the construction segment of the loan portfolio declined by million from million at december  to million at december  the construction segment of the loan portfolio declined by over and classified construction loans fell by accounting for the decline in allowance for loan loss allocation to this loan portfolio segment 
despite the decline in the total dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses  it has increased as a percentage of non accrual loans to at december   as compared to at december  this significant improvement is due to the reduction of non performing loans 

table of contents the balance of the allowance for loan losses peaked in in large part due to actions taken in the last three quarters of these actions in were targeted in three main segments real estate secured  commercial and industrial  and land 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the real estate secured segment of the loan portfolio in increased due in large part to higher balances of classified real estate loans  which led to an increase in specific credit reserves within this segment  increased levels of credit losses and the continued weakness in local and state economic conditions 
contributing further to the increase in the allocation to the real estate secured segment of the portfolio was an increase in watch list credits within this segment  specifically within commercial real estate 
increases in the allocation to commercial and industrial balances in can be attributed in large part to higher credit losses within this segment in conjunction with the continued weakened state of economic conditions 
a reduction in the allocation to the land segment of the loan portfolio in can be attributed in part to lower levels of classified balances within this segment as well as the charge off of specific reserves 
although we have experienced some stabilization in general economic conditions and real estate values in  should the local market experience further deterioration in economic conditions or credit quality of the segments mentioned above it may result in additional significant provisions for loan losses and increases in the allocation of the allowance to those categories 
at december   the balance of classified loans was approximately million 
this compares to the million in classified loan balances reported at december  the decline in the level of classified loans is due in part to the upgrade of several loans  totaling million  in resulting from the improved condition of the borrower and the impacts of the loan sales and pay downs  which aggregated million in these reductions in classified loans were partially offset by net downgrades of million of new loans to substandard status during the period 
although the improvement in classified assets has had a direct impact on the level of calculated general portfolio allocation  under the company s methodology for determining an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  other factors  such as elevated recent historical charge off levels  and continued concerns over the speed and level of recovery of the local economy and real estate values require us to maintain a historically high allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs to average loans for were 
this compares to reported in at december   the allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans compared to reported at december  the decline in the allowance as a percentage of gross loans reflects management s efforts to reduce the level of non accruing loans in  as well as trends in the overall loan portfolio in which we have seen declines in the levels of past due loans and loans that are identified as special mention  substandard and doubtful see note loans and note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k filing for additional details 
while the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans declined in  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans increased significantly to at december  from at december  as of december   management believes the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
summary of credit losses loans charged off during totaled approximately million 
this compares to charge offs of approximately million reported in the decrease in charge offs in as compared to prior year is due in large part to elevated charge off levels in the second and third quarters of  when we recorded charge offs equal to of our current basis in several loans in our portfolio 
these charge offs were recorded due to the prolonged deterioration in the borrowers ability to repay and the lack of viable collateral to continue to justify any level of recoverability against these loans 
of the charge off activity  million were made to write down problem loans to their estimated fair values  which equaled the agreed upon sales price of such loans 
for the year ended december   charge offs totaled million  representing an increase of million or from that reported for losses occurred primarily in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate  and construction land segments of the portfolio 
the charge offs in these segments were driven by a few discrete credit issues in each segment that required the full charge off of the entire balance of the loan due to the specific facts and circumstances of each loan  as opposed to wholesale issues across each segment

additionally  the company transferred approximately million to the oreo portfolio and sold substantially all of the assets transferred into oreo during by year end 
the company also received approximately million in principal payments on non accruing loans during non performing assets totaled approximately million at december   approximately million lower than reported at december  the decline in non performing assets is primarily due to the declines in non accruing loans discussed above as well as a million reduction in oreo  due to sale of oreo assets in

other real estate owned oreo as of december   the balance of oreo was million  a decrease of million from that reported at december  this decrease reflected the company s strategy to aggressively work to reduce non performing assets  as the company sold million of oreo assets through the company s effort to reduce the level of oreo was partially offset by million of newly foreclosed assets being transferred to oreo during the year 
the majority of the assets transferred in were commercial real estate and to a lesser degree residential family 
exiting  the company held properties  the largest of which was a single family residential speculative property with an estimated fair value of just over million

this line item will vary depending on daily cash settlement activities  the amount of highly liquid assets needed based on known events such as the repayment of borrowings  and actual cash on hand in the branches 
the year to date increase is attributable to a combination of the december balance being lower than normal due to the pay down of various obligations prior to the end of the year and elevated balances at december due to the timing lag between receipt of proceeds from investment security sales and maturities near the end of the month and redeployment of such funds into the investment portfolio

during  the company recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately million on the sale of various investment securities 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with related unrealized net gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  recorded as an adjustment to the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
at december   the securities portfolio had net unrealized gains  net of taxes of approximately million  an increase in the level of unrealized gains of approximately million from the unrealized loss position reported at december  changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio in the last three years can be attributed to extreme market turbulence and volatility in capital markets interest rates  stemming in part from continued weakened economic conditions and uncertain market conditions 
during the last three years  the credit markets came under significant stress as investor and consumer confidence in the us financial system became significantly destabilized 
as a result  many financial institutions in severe need of liquidity were forced to de leverage for a variety of reasons  selling significant portions of their investment holdings which in turn placed considerable pressure on the values of many classes of investment securities 
in particular  mortgage related securities came under substantial pressure and the company s portfolio was not immune to this 
although substantially all of the company s mortgage related securities are considered investment grade  overall lack of confidence in the housing market  the inability of many consumers to meet their mortgage related obligations  and the strong need for liquidity during the last two years have  among other things  been influential in placing pressure on the prices of these types of securities 
as more fully discussed in note investment securities  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k  at december   we owned five whole loan private label mortgage backed securities pmbs with a remaining principal balance of approximately million 
at december   one bond with an aggregate fair value of approximately million remained below investment grade 
this bond is in a senior tranche of its respective bond structure  meaning the company has priority in cash flows and has subordinate tranches below its position providing credit support 
during the fourth quarter of the company performed an analysis  with the assistance of an independent third party  on several pmbs in the investment portfolio for other than temporary impairment otti  including those previously mentioned 
based on that analysis  the company determined four securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
as a result  the company realized approximately million in aggregate pre tax losses related to these securities during the fourth quarter of since that time  the company has recognized a loss of million in the second quarter of and an additional million in the first quarter of associated with the sale of two of the pmbs on which it had previously recognized otti 
the losses recognized on the sale of these securities were due to changes in market pricing and did not indicate further credit related deterioration that would have impacted the ultimate value received upon sale 
the company continues to perform regular extensive analyses on pmbs bonds in the portfolio  including but not limited to updates on credit enhancements  loan to values  credit scores  delinquency rates and default rates 
these investment securities continue to demonstrate cash flows as expected  based on pre purchase analyses 
as of december   management does not believe that losses on pmbs in the portfolio  other than those previously discussed  are other than temporary

total deposit balances were million at december   a decrease of million from that reported at december  decreased deposit balances can be attributed to lower balances of interest bearing demand  money market  and time deposits 
we believe that customer movement out of these interest bearing accounts is due to depositors moving their investments into higher risk higher return investment vehicles outside of the traditional offerings provided by us  due to the continued depressed rates of return on traditional savings  money market and time deposit offerings 
the declines in interest bearing deposits were largely offset by increases in non interest bearing deposits and savings

these sources include  among others  the federal home loan bank fhlb  the federal reserve bank frb and credit lines established with correspondent banks 
at december   fhlb borrowings were million or million higher than that reported at december  the year over year increase in fhlb borrowing can be attributed to short term cash needs to fund reductions in deposit levels that occurred in the last few weeks of the year as several large commercial customers drew down the deposit levels to make year end payments for taxes  distributions to their owners and purchases of investment properties

table of contents the leverage ratio calculation divides common stockholders equity reduced by goodwill  intangible assets and a portion of net deferred tax assets by the total assets 
in the tier risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is risk weighted assets  which is determined by segregating all assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio  again  uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the loan loss reserve  long term capital debt  certain types of preferred equity and other instruments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the banking subsidiary level 
thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the banking subsidiary level other than million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trust 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the banking subsidiary level 
the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties  california  are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results and believes that it can continue to manage the short term effect of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the company s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the company s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the company s balance sheet is slightly liability sensitive 
this means that until such time as a substantial portion of the company s variable rate loan portfolio returns to rates above their floor levels  the company would expect all other things being equal to experience a contraction in its net interest income if rates rise and conversely to experience expansion in net interest income  if rates fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the following tables is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the company s alco policies 
management will continue to perform this analysis each quarter to further validate the expected results against actual data 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled quarterly 
the results of these models indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
management believes the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a and rate increase and decrease is acceptable and within policy guidelines at this time 

table of contents the results in the table below indicate the change in net interest income the company would expect to see as of december   if interest rates were to change in the amounts set forth rate shock scenarios dollar amounts in thousands bp bp base bp bp net interest income change from base change from base it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
the following table shows management s estimates of how the loan portfolio is segregated between variable lines and fixed rate loans and estimates of re pricing opportunities for the entire loan portfolio at december  dollars in thousands percent of rate type balance total variable daily variable other than daily fixed rate total gross loans the table above identifies approximately of the loan portfolio that will re price immediately in a changing rate environment 
at december   approximately million or of the company s loan portfolio is considered variable 
the following table shows the repricing categories of the company s loan portfolio at december  dollars in thousands percent of re pricing balance total year years years years total gross loans the following table provides a summary of the loans the company can expect to see adjust above floor rates based on given movements in the prime rate as of december  move in prime rate bps dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor 
table of contents given the significant decline in prime rate over the last two years  many loans in the portfolio possess floors significantly higher than the current prime rate 
as indicated in the table above  the company will need to see rates increase by to basis points before the majority of variable rate loans in the portfolio start to come off their floors thereby ending their fixed rate interest rate risk profile and returning them to a fully variable interest rate risk profile 
when such occurs  holding all other interest rate risk variables constant  the company will become more net asset sensitive 
during the last several years  the company moved to protect net interest margin by implementing floors on new loan originations 
management believes this strategy proved successful in insulating net interest margin in the declining interest rate environment experienced over the last several years 
however in a rising rate environment  management believes that these loan floors will result in compression of net interest margin and potentially a decline in net interest income 
as indicated in the table above  the majority of our variable rate loans will not rise above their floors until the prime rate increases basis points 
until such time as rates increase above the floors  increases in interest rates may have a greater impact on our overall cost of funds  which could result in a reduction in net interest income and net interest margin  as previously reflected in the rate shock table in this item a 
the company also attempts to quantify the impact of interest rate changes on borrowers ability to pay on loans and the impact of similar rate changes on the value of collateral held against loans 
to this end  the company  from time to time  will sample loans and analyze them under a rate shock scenario to specifically assess the impact of the rate shock on financial ratios such as interest rate coverage and loan to value 
the results of the analysis have generally revealed that in the case of such a rate shock  a high percentage of loans tested would continue to express ratios within current underwriting guidelines 
the results of these analyses are considered acceptable by management
