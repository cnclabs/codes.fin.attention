overview our mission is to make people s lives easier  less stressful  fun and more productive when they are on the go 
our personalized mobile navigation and location based services  or lbs  are created to meet the challenges of on the go people  such as deciding where to go  when to leave  how to get there and what to do 
our most recent services have solved these challenges by creating products that uniquely provide easily accessed  relevant  personalized information for discovery  traffic  local search and navigation and are available across the multiple integral tools used when fighting the daily commute  shopping and running errands  exploring town for dining and entertainment  and travelling  including mobile phones  tablets  computers and cars 
with millions of users able to access telenav while on the go today  we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on growing market opportunities related to connected cars and mobile advertising 
we derive revenue from wireless carriers  automobile manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  advertising and end users 
we primarily derive our revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers who sell our lbs to their subscribers either as a standalone service or in a bundle with other data or voice services and from automobile manufacturers whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services 
we currently provide our lbs to customers in north america  asia  europe and south america 
through our hosted service delivery model  we provide our solutions to end users and customers through the networks of leading wireless carriers in the united states  including at t mobility llc  or at t  sprint nextel corporation  or sprint  t mobile usa  inc  or t mobile  us cellular corporation  or us cellular  and through certain wireless carriers in other countries 
we also provide on board and connected off board navigation software and services for automobile manufacturers and oems 
our flexible and proprietary platform enables us to efficiently reach and retain millions of end users  across all major mobile phone operating systems on a broad range of wireless network protocols as well as through advanced automotive navigation systems 
this platform provides data and analytics that enable us to create more personalized experiences for mobile applications  location based advertising and customer lifecycle management 
we generate revenue from service subscriptions  including premium offerings  fixed fee arrangements  software licenses  and local mobile advertising 
our customers include end users  wireless carriers  automobile manufacturers and oems  advertisers and agencies  and enterprises 
end users with subscriptions for our services are generally billed for our services through their wireless carrier or through application stores 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
we also derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of customized software in automotive navigation 
table of contents applications 
for example  ford motor company  or ford  utilizes our on board automotive navigation product in its ford sync platform  which includes myford touch and mylincoln touch 
ford began shipping this product in certain north american vehicles with the model year  and our navigation solution is currently deployed on different ford and lincoln models 
ford and lincoln models with our on board automotive navigation product began shipping to south america with the model year 
our automobile manufacturer and oem customers pay us a royalty fee upon production of a vehicle with our automotive navigation solutions 
our fiscal year ends june in this form k  we refer to the fiscal year ended june   and as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our total revenue grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal our net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal key components of our results of operations sources of revenue gps navigator is our voice guided  real time  turn by turn  mobile navigation service 
our technology also powers automotive navigation solutions that provide accurate  easy to use lbs to drivers  including search  poi and traffic services 
our enterprise lbs allow enterprises to monitor and manage mobile workforces and assets by using our lbs platform to track job status and the location of workers  field assets and equipment 
we have introduced other lbs solutions with new business models and distribution channels in our current lbs market and adjacent markets 
these solutions include location based mobile advertising and premium lbs 
while we have already introduced certain components or initial versions of several of these lbs solutions  the scope and timing of broader and more commercially viable offerings is uncertain 
the ultimate scope and timing of any future releases are dependent on many factors  including adoption by wireless carrier customers  automobile manufacturers and oems of our lbs  end user adoption and preferences  the quality  features and timing of our product offerings  the impact of competition  and market acceptance of mobile advertising and social networking 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to cover the costs of these anticipated efforts 
we primarily derive our revenue from our wireless carrier customers for their end users subscriptions to our lbs  as well as from activation fees for certain of our services 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
certain of our contracts provide our wireless carrier customers with discounts based on the number of end users paying for our services in a given month 
in general  our wireless carrier customers pay us a lower monthly fee per end user if an end user subscribes to our lbs as part of a bundle of mobile data or voice services than if an end user subscribes to our lbs on a standalone basis 
in addition  we derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
we also offer our applications directly to end users through application stores such as the apple app store and google play 
more recently  we have implemented revenue models based on free versions of our services which can generate fees through advertising supported arrangements  and subscriber upgrades to more premium versions for a fee 
in the future  we may have other revenue models 
our wireless carrier customers are responsible for billing and collecting the fees they charge their subscribers for the right to use our lbs 
with respect to sprint  through june   we will receive a guaranteed fixed fee from sprint for navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles with other sprint services 
we recognize revenue for the aggregate annual fees monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
when we are paid on a revenue sharing basis with our wireless carrier customers  the amount we receive varies depending on several factors  including the revenue share rate negotiated with the wireless carrier 
table of contents customer  the price charged to the subscriber by the wireless carrier customer  the specific sales channel of the wireless carrier customer in which the service is offered and the features and capability of the service 
as a result of these factors  the amount we receive for a subscriber may vary considerably and is subject to change over time 
in addition  the amount we are paid per end user in our revenue sharing arrangements may also vary depending upon the metric used to determine the amount of the payment  including the number of end users at any time during a month  the average monthly paying end users  the number and timing of end user billing cycles and end user activity 
although our wireless carrier customers generally have sole discretion about how to price our lbs to their subscribers  our revenue sharing arrangements generally include monthly minimum fees per end user 
to a much lesser extent  we also sell our services directly to consumers through application stores 
sprint represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we operate under an agreement with sprint  which we most recently amended in july under this amended agreement  we and sprint have agreed to continue the fixed fee arrangement related to the sprint bundle through june   and to partner to generate revenue from premium navigation and mobile advertising programs through december  this amendment will result in a significant reduction in our revenue from sprint beginning july  compared to revenue levels recognized prior to the amendment 
sprint is not obligated to continue to bundle our navigation services after june   and even if sprint does continue to bundle we may not receive meaningful compensation for such distribution of our services 
at t represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
our agreement with at t expires in march and provides that we will continue to be the exclusive provider of white label gps navigation services to at t 
at t is not required to offer our lbs 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on at t and to a lesser extent  sprint for a material portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
ford represented of our revenue in fiscal and less than of our revenue in fiscal and fiscal we provide both an on board and an off board connected navigation solution to ford 
our on board solution consists of software  map and poi data loaded in the vehicle that provides voice guided turn by turn navigation displayed on the vehicle screen 
we recognize revenue from our on board solutions as the related customized software is delivered to  and accepted by our customers 
in addition  we recognize royalties earned from our on board solutions generally as the software is reproduced and installed in vehicles 
our off board connected solution enables a mobile device that is paired with the vehicle to activate in vehicle text based and voice guided turn by turn navigation 
we recognize revenue from our off board connected solutions monthly based on annual subscriptions  which are subject to a maximum annual fee with ford 
subscription fees from our wireless carrier customers represented a substantial majority of our revenue for fiscal  and subscription fees from our gps navigator service represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
subscription fee revenue from our gps navigator service declined from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to the transition to a fixed fee with sprint and a decrease in the number of paying subscribers for navigation services provided through at t  t mobile and alltel 
revenue from our automotive navigation solutions represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from our enterprise lbs  mobile advertising and premium lbs represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we generated  and of our revenue  respectively  in the united states 
in absolute dollars  revenue from our international operations increased in fiscal we are pursuing expansion opportunities with wireless carriers in other countries and therefore expect international revenue to increase in absolute dollars over the longer term 

table of contents cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the third party content  such as map  poi  traffic  gas price and weather data and voice recognition technology that we use in providing our lbs 
our cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with data center operations  customer support  the amortization of capitalized software  recognition of deferred development costs on specific projects and stock based compensation 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is the fees we pay to providers of map and poi data  tomtom and navteq 
we have long term agreements with tomtom and navteq pursuant to which we pay royalties according to a variety of different fee schedules  including on a per use basis  on a per end user per month basis and on a fixed fee basis 
with respect to both tomtom and navteq  we are required to pay certain minimum fees for access to their content by our mobile navigation customers 
for our on board navigation solutions provided to ford  we pay royalties on a per unit produced basis 
we primarily provide customer support through a third party provider to whom we provide training and assistance with problem resolution 
we use three outsourced  hosted data centers to provide our services and industry standard hardware to provide our lbs 
we generally offer to our wireless carrier customers and generally maintain at least uptime every month  excluding designated periods of maintenance 
our internal targets for service uptime are even higher 
we have in the past  and may in the future  not achieve our targets for service availability and may incur penalties for failure to meet contractual service availability requirements  including loss of a portion of subscriber fees for the month or termination of our wireless carrier customer agreement 
we use map and poi data from tomtom to provide services for sprint s bundled offerings 
we pay tomtom a percentage of the fees earned from sprint for basic navigation services and gross advertising and a flat monthly fee per subscriber for premium services 
we also pay tomtom certain guaranteed minimum payments for such services 
the expiration of the license period for navigation services we provide using data provided by tomtom for sprint s bundled offerings is june  we expect that our cost of revenue will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as the number of our end users increases  including those through bundled or freemium offerings as well as automotive offerings  and average usage of our services by end users increases 
we anticipate that our cost of revenue will also increase over time as we continue to enhance the richness of the content offered by our products and if we increase the percentage of our revenue from automotive navigation solutions  which generally have higher associated third party content costs than our navigation offerings provided through wireless carriers 
in addition  our cost of revenue will be impacted by amortization and depreciation expenses associated with planned data center capacity and redundancy increases  as well as increased amortization and recognition of deferred software development costs 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  which include salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense 
other expenses include marketing program costs  facilities  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional service fees 
we allocate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of the fair value of stock based awards granted  based on the department in which the option holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent and depreciation  to each expense category based on headcount 
our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  as we became a public company and built our infrastructure and added employees primarily in fiscal and fiscal across all categories to support our growth  developed new services and products  and expanded into international markets 
we expect that certain costs will continue to increase over time  including compensation and related costs  however  we are evaluating spending in certain areas and taking actions to create greater efficiencies 
to that end  in the june quarter we consolidated our 
table of contents beijing and shanghai offices to reduce certain duplications and create greater operational effectiveness 
we anticipate continued investment of resources  including the hiring of additional headcount  in our strategic growth areas 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our development employees and costs of outside consultants 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving the ease of use and functionality of our existing services  as well as developing new service and product offerings in our existing markets and in new markets 
the majority of our research and development employees are located in our development centers in china and  as a result  a substantial portion of our research and development expense is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  notably the chinese renminbi  or rmb 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales  product management and marketing staff  commissions earned by our sales personnel and the cost of marketing programs and advertising 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been derived from wireless carriers  which bear much of the expense of marketing and promoting our services to their subscribers 
as a result  the majority of our sales and marketing expenses relate to supporting our wireless carrier customers and attracting new wireless carrier customers to offer our lbs 
we expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing activities  in part  to support our initiatives in the auto industry and mobile advertising and to promote our branded services directly to end users 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional services and corporate expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
during fiscal  other income expense  net also included the expense resulting from the change in fair value of our outstanding series e preferred stock warrants 
we classified these warrants as a liability on our balance sheets and recorded changes in their fair value from period to period in other income expense  net on our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   all remaining outstanding series e preferred stock warrants had been exercised and the warrant liability was reclassified to preferred stock 
the preferred shares converted to common stock upon the closing of our ipo and were reclassified as common stock and additional paid in capital 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits earned from our lbs in the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require our judgment in its application 
in other cases  our judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting policies that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of those services has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we primarily derive our revenue from subscriptions to access our lbs  which are generally provided through our wireless carrier customers that offer our services to their subscribers or through application stores 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services or a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
our end users who subscribe to our services through application stores pay us a monthly or annual subscription fee 
we recognize monthly fees related to our services in the month we provide the services 
we defer amounts received in advance of the service being provided and recognize the deferred amounts when the monthly service has been provided 
we recognize revenue for fixed annual fees for any number of subscribers receiving our services as part of bundles monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
our agreements do not contain general rights of refund once the service has been provided 
we also establish allowances for estimated credits subsequently issued to end users by our wireless carrier customers 
we defer activation fees received upon the initiation of certain services and recognize the deferred amounts over the estimated average length of subscription to the service  historically months 
we recognize as revenue the amount our wireless carrier customers report to us as we provide our services  which are net of any revenue sharing or other fees earned and deducted by our wireless carrier customers 
we are not the principal provider when selling access to our lbs through our wireless carrier customers as the subscribers directly contract with our wireless carrier customers 
in addition  we earn a fixed fee or fixed percentage of fees charged by our wireless carrier customers and our wireless carrier customers have the sole ability to set the price charged to their subscribers for our service 
our wireless carrier customers have direct responsibility for billing and collecting those fees from their subscribers and we and our wireless carrier customers may offer subscribers a day free trial for our service 
we also derive revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties earned from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
we generally recognize software customization revenue using the completed contract method of contract accounting under which revenue is recognized upon delivery to  and acceptance by  the automobile manufacturer of our on board navigation solutions 
we generally recognize royalty revenue as the software is reproduced and installed in vehicles  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
in certain instances  due to the nature and timing of monthly revenue and subscriber reporting from our wireless carrier customers  we may be required to make estimates of the amount of lbs revenue to recognize from a wireless carrier customer for the current period 
for example  certain of our wireless carrier customers do not provide us with sufficient monthly individual subscriber billing period details to allow us to compute the allocation of monthly service fees to the individual end user s service period  and in such cases we make estimates of any required service period revenue cutoff 
in addition  if we fail to receive an accurate revenue report from a wireless carrier customer for the month  we will need to estimate the amount of revenue that should be recorded for that month 
these estimates may require judgment  and we consider certain factors and information in making these estimates such as subscriber data supplied by our wireless carrier customers  wireless carrier customer specific historical subscription and revenue reporting trends  end user subscription data from our internal systems  and data from comparable distribution channels of our other wireless carrier customers 

table of contents if we are unable to reasonably estimate recognizable revenue from a wireless carrier customer for a given period  we defer recognition of revenue to the period in which we receive and validate the wireless carrier customer s revenue report and all of our revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we have recorded an estimated revenue amount  we record any difference between the estimated revenue and actual revenue in the period when we receive the final revenue reports from our wireless carrier customer  which typically occurs within the following month 
to date  actual amounts have not differed materially from our estimates 
software development costs 
we account for the costs of computer software we develop for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs  which are incurred during the application development stage  and amortizing those costs over the application s estimated useful life  which generally ranges from to months depending on the type of application 
costs incurred and capitalized during the application development stage generally include the costs of software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
such costs primarily include payroll and payroll related expenses for employees directly involved in the application development  as well as third party developer fees 
we expense preliminary evaluation costs as they are incurred before the application development stage  as well as post development implementation and operation costs  such as training  maintenance and minor upgrades 
we begin amortizing capitalized costs when a project is ready for its intended use  and we periodically reassess the estimated useful life of a project considering the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors which may result in a shorter remaining life 
we capitalized million  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to these costs  which was recorded in cost of revenue  totaled million  million and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
we also account for the costs of computer software we develop for customers requiring significant modification or customization by deferring qualifying costs under the completed contract method 
all such development costs incurred are deferred until the related revenue is recognized 
we deferred million  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
development costs expensed to cost of revenue totaled  million and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of our property and equipment  long term investments and intangible assets with definite lives may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is significantly impacted by our estimates and assumptions of future revenue  costs  and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
when these factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
we base the impairment  if any  on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows of those assets  and record it in the period in which we make the determination 
during fiscal  we recorded a loss of  in connection with an impairment in the carrying value of one of our long term investments 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements under the fair value recognition method  which requires us to measure the stock based compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value  and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the employees requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of these awards with time based vesting on a straight line basis over an employee s requisite service period of each of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures 

table of contents our stock based compensation expense was as follows fiscal year ended june  in thousands cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense as of june   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards  net of estimated forfeitures  that we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  which requires a number of estimates and assumptions 
in valuing share based awards under the fair value accounting method  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share based awards prior to exercising 
the expected volatility of our stock is based on the historical volatility of various comparable companies  as we do not have sufficient historical data with regards to the volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term was based on an analysis of our historical exercise and cancellation activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock  the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
in addition  the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for fiscal  and  we calculated the fair value of options granted to employees using the black scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions fiscal year ended june  dividend yield expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  or irs  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are 
table of contents reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  will be realized 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for fiscal  and  as well as a percentage that each line item represents of our revenue for those periods 
the additional key metrics presented are used in addition to the financial measures reflected in the consolidated statements of income data to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
the period to period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods

revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased revenue from automotive navigation solutions we provide for ford vehicles  including the launch of our solutions in additional ford and lincoln models  growth in monthly subscription fees from end users of our mobile navigation services provided through us cellular  growth in revenue from monetization of freemium offerings through wireless carriers and application stores  growth in mobile navigation revenue internationally  and an increase in enterprise lbs revenue 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue from sprint bundle users resulting from our september sprint amendment  whereby we transitioned to a fixed fee  and decreases in the number of paying subscribers for mobile navigation services provided through at t  t mobile and alltel  which has gradually discontinued offering our services in conjunction with its acquisition by verizon in early paying end users as of period end represents the number of paying end users  excluding any users that subscribe under daily plans 
generally  we consider a paying end user to be a subscriber for whom we are paid and for which such subscriber s mobile device has the capability to access our lbs 
paying end users increased from million as of june  to million as of june   primarily resulting from the continued increase in subscribers to bundled plans across several wireless carriers  which include our lbs navigation application in bundles they offer to their customers 
the majority of our end users receive access to our navigation application through bundled offerings  for which we are paid by the carrier that offers such bundles 
we also have end users that pay a fee for our navigation offerings through either a monthly or annual subscription to our voice guided turn by turn navigation service  including users who pay to upgrade to our premium services 
in addition to paying end users  as of june  we had in excess of million users of our freemium offerings  which include free voice guided turn by turn navigation for certain android platforms and a free visual navigation application for the iphone 
while we do not directly collect revenue from these free basic 
table of contents navigation services  we offer a path to upgrade to premium paid services  and we also leverage these customers to drive mobile advertising revenue 
in september  we amended our agreement with sprint  which changed the way in which we receive revenue from the majority of the services we provide to sprint s subscribers 
rather than receiving a fee per subscriber per month  we agreed to receive a guaranteed annual fixed fee from sprint for navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles with other sprint services 
the annual fee changes from year to year over the contract period and limits the maximum number of subscribers covered under such fee in a given year 
sprint will generally pay us these annual fees in advance 
we recognize revenue for the aggregate annual fees monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
in july  we further amended and extended our contract with sprint 
under this amended agreement  we and sprint have agreed to continue the fixed fee arrangement related to the sprint bundle through june   and to partner to generate revenue from premium navigation and mobile advertising programs through december  this amendment will result in a significant reduction in revenue related to bundled navigation solutions from sprint beginning july  in fiscal and  revenue from sprint represented and of our revenue  respectively  and revenue from at t represented and of our revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  ford represented of our revenue 
no other customer represented more than of our revenue in either period 
subscription fees from our gps navigator service represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from our automotive navigation solutions represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we primarily sell our services in the united states 
in fiscal and  revenue derived from us sources represented and of our revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and at a higher rate than the increase in revenue for the comparable period primarily due to a increase in third party content costs and increased customer support and data center costs 
third party content costs increased due to higher associated with the on board navigation revenue from ford  which generally has higher associated third party content costs than our lbs offerings provided through wireless carriers 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred development costs expensed  as fiscal included deferred development costs expensed in connection with revenue from ford 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to the increased proportion of revenue contributed from our on board navigation solutions provided to ford  which generally have higher associated content costs and resulting lower gross margins than our lbs services provided through our wireless carrier customers 
we expect our gross margin to continue to decline as the percentage of our revenue from automotive offerings increases  and as a result of increased competition on our offering of mobile navigation services especially from other freemium offerings 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with increased compensation and benefits for our global employee base and increased us headcount to enhance the functionality of our services and develop new offerings 
we also incurred increased rent expense associated with our new sunnyvale facilities 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the total number of research and development personnel decreased  from at june  to at june  the decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of our beijing and shanghai offices in may however  the number of us research and development 
table of contents personnel increased during the same period and average per employee costs in the united states remain higher than in china 
we believe that as we continue to invest in expanding the lbs we offer  establish relationships with new wireless carrier customers and automobile manufacturers and oems and develop new services and products  revenue from those investments and development efforts will lag the related research and development expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand the services and products we offer 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the costs associated with increased headcount to strengthen and diversify our product offerings  including automotive navigation solutions  premium services and advertising 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased  from at june  to at june  we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase over time in absolute dollars

our general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased legal costs and costs associated with higher compensation and benefits costs 
this was offset by slightly lower average headcount during the year 
legal costs included settlement of certain intellectual property litigation and increased legal fees for litigation and intellectual property protection 
the total number of general and administrative personnel decreased  from at june  to at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that our general and administrative expenses will fluctuate in absolute dollars primarily based upon our legal fees incurred in connection with our defense against intellectual property claims 
other income  net 
our other income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was primarily due to increased interest income due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal our effective tax rate of in fiscal is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of a favorable tax ruling from the state of california with respect to our apportionment method for our fiscal california income tax liability and the domestic manufacturing deduction  partially offset by the detriment of nondeductible stock compensation 
the usage of our remaining us federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively  is substantially limited each fiscal year by section of the internal revenue code 
we adopted the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  standard for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes at the beginning of fiscal as of june   our cumulative unrecognized tax benefit was million  of which  was netted against deferred tax assets 
upon adoption  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  california  various states  and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries 
the statute of limitations remains open for fiscal in the us  for fiscal through fiscal in state jurisdictions  and for fiscal through in foreign jurisdictions 
fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized 

table of contents we believe it was reasonably possible that  as of june   the gross unrecognized tax benefits  could decrease whether by payment  release  or a combination of both by as much as  in the next months 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our provision for income taxes 
we had  and  accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at june  and  respectively 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to growth in paying end users from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily resulting from the continued adoption of sprint s simply everything and any mobile  anytime plans which include our lbs  as well as an increase in end users of at t navigator and growth through new carrier relationships  including t mobile and us cellular 
we also experienced significant revenue growth from our automotive navigation partnership with ford during fiscal  with the launch of ford mytouch on certain models in north america

cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal we expensed certain capitalized software development costs associated with revenue recognized from ford during fiscal cost of revenue increased at a higher rate than the increase in revenue for the comparable period primarily as a result of the third party content and related costs associated with the on board navigation revenue from ford and  to a lesser extent  the effect of our fixed fee arrangement with sprint  which resulted in a lower rate of revenue per end user in fiscal without an equivalent decrease in the respective costs related to such end users 
the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily driven by the increase in our number of end users 
the majority of the increase in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal was due to a increase in third party content costs  as well as increased software amortization costs  including deferred software development costs expensed in connection with revenue from ford  and increased customer support costs 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of our end users 
our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to the increased proportion of revenue contributed from our on board navigation solutions  which generally have higher associated content costs and resulting lower gross margins than our lbs services provided through our wireless carrier customers 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with increased headcount to enhance the functionality of our services and develop new offerings and increased compensation and benefits for our existing employees  as well as an increase in costs related to the use of consultants 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the total number of research and development personnel increased  from at june  to at june  
table of contents sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was the result of increased investment in our marketing and business development organizations  including the hiring of additional and more experienced personnel  including two vice presidents

legal costs included settlement of certain intellectual property litigation and increased legal fees for litigation  intellectual property protection and immigration 
the total number of general and administrative personnel increased  from at june  to at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and fiscal other income expense  net 
our other income expense  net was  in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was primarily due to increased interest income due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances and  to a lesser extent  elimination of the expense related to the increase in fair value of our series e preferred stock warrants 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods set forth below fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents at june   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which primarily consisted of money market mutual funds  municipal securities  corporate bonds and commercial paper held by well capitalized financial institutions 
from inception until fiscal  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of equity 
on may   we completed our ipo of  shares of common stock 
we raised net proceeds from the offering of million after deducting the underwriter s discount and offering expenses payable by us  based on an ipo price of per share  including  shares of common stock purchased by the underwriters in connection with the exercise of their over allotment option 
our accounts receivable are heavily concentrated in a small number of customers 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance was million  of which at t and ford represented and  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance due from sprint represented less than of total accounts receivable as of june  and will fluctuate based upon the timing of invoicing and payment under sprint s fixed fee arrangement 

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the timing and extent of expenditures to support development efforts  the expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities and headcount  the introduction of our new and enhanced service and product offerings and the growth in our end user base 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our financial obligations through at least the next months 
however  we may experience lower than expected cash generated from operating activities  revenue that is lower than we anticipate  or greater than expected cost of revenue or operating expenses 
our revenue and operating results could be lower than we anticipate if  among other reasons  our customers  three of which we are substantially dependent upon for a large portion of our revenue  were to limit or terminate our relationships with them  we were to fail to successfully compete in our highly competitive market  including against competitors who offer their services for free  our wireless carrier customers were to elect not to market and distribute our lbs to end users  or our wireless carrier customers were to elect to lower the prices charged to their subscribers for our service 
in the future  we may acquire businesses or technologies or license technologies from third parties  and we may decide to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to the extent we believe this is necessary to successfully complete these acquisitions or license these technologies 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  at the time we make such determinations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and liquidity and cash position

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
however  we have agreed to pay minimum annual license fees to certain of our third party content providers

due to uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlements with the taxing authority will occur 
warranties and indemnifications our agreements with our wireless carrier customers that offer our lbs generally include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if our lbs infringe a third party s intellectual property rights or for other specified reasons 
we have in the past received indemnification requests or notices of their intent to seek indemnification in the future from our wireless carrier customers with respect to litigation in which our wireless carrier customers have been named as defendants 
see the section entitled legal proceedings 
as it relates to past indemnification requests or notices  in certain situations we have agreed to defend or indemnify our wireless carriers for the indemnity demands 
for those notices where we have not agreed to provide indemnity or defense to date  or future demands for indemnity  we may in the future agree to defend and indemnify our wireless carriers or other customers  irrespective of whether we believe that we have an obligation to indemnify them or whether we believe our lbs infringe the asserted intellectual property rights 
alternatively  we may reject certain of our wireless carrier or other customers indemnity demands  including the outstanding demands  which may lead to disputes with our wireless carrier or other customers  negatively impact our relationships with them or result in litigation against us 
our wireless carrier or other customers may also claim that any rejection of their indemnity demands constitutes a material breach of our agreements with them  allowing them to terminate such agreements 
if  as a result of indemnity demands  we make substantial payments  our relationships with our wireless carrier or other customers are negatively impacted  or any of our wireless carrier or customer agreements is terminated  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 
as of june   any costs in connection with such indemnity demands which are probable and estimable have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors  officers and certain other employees for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while such persons are or were serving at our request in such capacity 
we may terminate the indemnification agreements with these persons upon the termination of their services with us  but termination will not affect claims for indemnification related to events occurring prior to the effective date of 
table of contents termination 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our potential exposure 
we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of june  off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued amended guidance to require an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended guidance eliminates the current option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
the amendment becomes effective retrospectively for our interim period ending september  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued guidance that defers the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income adopted in its june guidance 
this guidance becomes effective retrospectively for our interim period ending september  and earlier adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued amended guidance to simplify the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
the amendment becomes effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning september  and earlier adoption is permitted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we invest in a variety of securities  which primarily consist of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities and other debt securities of domestic corporations 
due to the nature of these investments and relatively short duration of the underlying securities  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
a appreciation or depreciation in interest rates in fiscal and would not have had a material impact on our interest income or the fair value of our marketable securities 
foreign currency risk 
substantially all of our revenue has been generated to date from our end users in the united states and  as such  our revenue has not been substantially exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
however  most of our contracts with our wireless carrier customers outside of the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore expose us to foreign currency risk 
should the revenue generated outside of the united states grow in absolute amounts and as a percentage of our revenue  we will increasingly be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  a substantial portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states  are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject 
table of contents to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the chinese rmb 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 
an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated receivables as of june  and june  would not have resulted in a material loss 
to date  we have not used any foreign exchange forward contracts or similar instruments to attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates
