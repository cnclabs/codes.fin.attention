table of contents overview we believe we are the leading national distributor based on sales of natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products in the united states and canada and that our twenty six distribution centers  representing approximately million square feet of warehouse space  provide us with the largest capacity of any north american based distributor in the natural  organic and specialty products industry 
we offer more than  high quality natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products  consisting of national brands  regional brands  private label and master distribution products  in six product categories grocery and general merchandise  produce  perishables and frozen foods  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition  bulk and food service products and personal care items 
we serve more than  customer locations primarily located across the united states and canada  the majority of which can be classified into one of the following categories independently owned natural products retailers  which include buying clubs  supernatural chains  which consist solely of whole foods market  conventional supermarkets  which include mass market chains  and other which includes foodservice and international customers outside of canada 
our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions 
these operating divisions are our wholesale division  which includes our broadline natural  organic and specialty distribution business in the united states  unfi canada  which is our natural  organic and specialty distribution business in canada  albert s  which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and non produce perishable items within the united states  and select nutrition  which distributes vitamins  minerals and supplements  our retail division  consisting of earth origins  which operates our thirteen natural products retail stores within the united states  and our manufacturing division  consisting of woodstock farms manufacturing  which specializes in the international importation  roasting  packaging and distribution of nuts  dried fruit  seeds  trail mixes  granola  natural and organic snack items  and confections  and our blue marble brands product lines 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our high quality service and a broader product selection  including specialty products  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural and specialty products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers  the introduction of new products and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we have been the primary distributor to whole foods market for more than fourteen years 
effective june  we amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market to extend the term of the agreement for an additional seven years 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we will continue to serve as the primary wholesale natural grocery distributor to whole foods market in its united states regions where we were serving as the primary distributor at the time of the amendment 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the agreement from september  to september  on july   we announced that we had entered into an asset purchase agreement under which we agreed to acquire certain assets of whole foods distribution previously used for their self distribution of non perishables in their rocky mountain and southwest regions and to become their primary distributor in these regions 
we closed this transaction in late september in the case of the southwest region and early october in the case of the rocky mountain region 
we now serve as the primary distributor to whole foods market in all of its regions in the united states and have amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market effective 
table of contents october to include these regions 
whole foods market accounted for approximately of our net sales for the years ended july  and july  in june  we acquired the sdg assets of sunopta through our wholly owned subsidiary  unfi canada for cash consideration of million 
with the acquisition  we became the largest distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods  including kosher foods  in canada 
this was a strategic acquisition as unfi canada provides us with an immediate platform for growth in the canadian market 
during fiscal  we utilized our unfi canada platform to further expand in the canadian market  including through our purchase of substantially all of the assets of a specialty food distribution business in the ontario market in november the ability to distribute specialty food items including ethnic  kosher and gourmet has accelerated our expansion into a number of high growth business markets and allowed us to establish immediate market share in the fast growing specialty foods market 
we have now integrated specialty food products and natural and organic specialty non food products into most of our broadline distribution centers across the united states and canada 
due to our expansion into specialty foods  we were awarded new business with a number of conventional supermarkets since fiscal that we previously had not done business with because we did not distribute specialty products 
we believe that distribution of these products enhances our conventional supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross selling 
on june   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with l r distributors pursuant to which we agreed to sell our conventional non foods and general merchandise lines of business  including certain inventory related to these product lines 
this divestiture was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  and has allowed us to concentrate on our core business of the distribution of natural  organic  and specialty foods and non food products 
to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on time deliveries than our competitors  centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce the geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities in an effort to achieve increasing operating efficiencies 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities 
at july   our distribution capacity totaled approximately million square feet 
in september  we commenced operations of a new facility in charlotte  north carolina serving albert s customers in north carolina  south carolina  georgia  tennessee and virginia 
in connection with the acquisition of the sdg assets in june  we acquired five distribution centers which provided nationwide presence in canada with approximately  square feet of distribution space and the ability to serve all major markets in canada 
in september  we began shipping products from our distribution center in lancaster  texas  which serves customers throughout the southwestern united 
table of contents states  including texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana 
in october  in connection with the acquisition of the rocky mountain distribution business of whole foods distribution  we took over the operations  including the assumption of an operating lease at a distribution center in aurora  colorado  augmenting our existing aurora  colorado distribution center  which was at capacity  in serving customers in colorado  utah  arizona and new mexico 
in april  we leased a new  square foot distribution center in aurora  colorado which is expected to become operational in the summer of and will replace our existing two broadline distribution centers  an albert s distribution center and an off site storage location 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural  organic and specialty products to retailers  adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution centers 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us at our manufacturing subsidiary  woodstock farms manufacturing  for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment  offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies are i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of july  and july   respectively 

table of contents insurance reserves we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  and general and automobile liability insurance 
it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for workers compensation and automobile liabilities totaled million and million as of july  and july   respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are at or one level below the operating segment level 
beginning in fiscal  the first step in our annual assessment of each of our reporting units is a qualitative assessment as allowed under asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  unless we believe it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than the carrying value 
in order to qualify for an exclusion from the quantitative two step goodwill test  the thresholds used by the company for this determination are that a reporting unit must have passed its previous two step test with a margin of calculated fair value versus carrying value of at least  have had no significant changes to its working capital structure  and have current year income streams which are at least of prior year amounts 
for reporting units which do not meet this exclusion  the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
during the first quarter of the fiscal year  we performed a test for goodwill impairment as a result of the expected change in future cash flows for certain of our branded product lines within our blue marble brands reporting unit  and determined that no impairment existed 
as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
approximately of our goodwill is within our wholesale reporting unit 
both our wholesale distribution reporting unit and our earth origins market reporting unit were evaluated under the 
table of contents qualitative guidelines described above and did not require the quantitative two step test 
our blue marble brands and woodstock farms manufacturing reporting units were subject to the two step quantitative test  and each exceeded their carrying values by more than  and were not considered at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
we believe that these projected results are achievable  though these assumptions are based upon our current business model and may be negatively affected if we attempt to dispose of any of our brands  stores or facilities or substantially change how we market and sell our products 
for all of our assessments  the weighted average cost of capital used in calculating the present value of future cash flows was 
total goodwill as of july  and july  was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired 
impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
as of our most recent annual impairment test  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was in excess of their carrying value 
the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets related to our branded product lines was more than in excess of its carrying value 
during fiscal  our long term plans related to the trade name of a portion of our canadian wholesale distribution business evolved  and we decided to phase out this trade name 
as a result  we will begin amortizing this trade name over a period of ten years 
as the underlying business will not be changing significantly but rather we will simply be phasing out the trade name  it was not tested for impairment 
the projections used in the impairment assessment for the branded product line asset group assume sales growth of approximately per year  with gross margin and operating expenses which on average approximate current levels as a percentage of sales 
we believe these projections are reasonable based on our historical trends and expectation of future results 
total indefinite lived intangible assets as of july  and july  were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset s useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our finite lived intangibles are not recoverable during total finite lived intangible assets as of july  and july  were million and million  respectively 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  july  july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment expenses total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense interest income other  net total other expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  or million  to a record billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to growth in our wholesale segment of million  which includes net sales from a national conventional supermarket customer that began shipping in october and the strong performance of our unfi canada division 
our organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions is due to the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and value added services  and a broader selection of products  including specialty foods 
we believe that the integration of our specialty business has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  were also favorably impacted by moderate price inflation 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in incremental net sales resulting from expanded distribution to whole foods market during fiscal following the acquisition of whole foods distributions s southwest and rocky mountain distribution business and expanded distribution agreement with whole foods market in the first quarter of fiscal and approximately million in sales resulting from our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a specialty food distribution business in the ontario market in november 
table of contents our net sales by customer type for the years ended july  and july  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by approximately million  or during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  and therefore represent a lower percentage of our total net sales compared to the prior year 
whole foods market is our only supernatural chain customer  and net sales to whole foods market for the year ended july  increased by approximately million or over the prior year and accounted for approximately of our total net sales for the years ended july  and july  the increase in sales to whole foods market is primarily due to the increases in same store sales  and to a lesser extent  the expanded primary distribution agreement noted above 
net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended july  increased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in net sales to conventional supermarkets is primarily due to a large national customer which we began servicing during the first quarter of fiscal  as part of our strategy to be the sole supplier of natural  organic and specialty products to our conventional supermarket customers 
other net sales  which include sales to foodservice and sales from the united states to countries other than canada  as well as sales through our retail division  manufacturing division  and our branded product lines  increased by approximately million or during the fiscal year ended july  over the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal as we continue to aggressively pursue new customers and as economic conditions continue to stabilize  we expect net sales for fiscal to grow over fiscal we believe that the integration of our specialty business into our national platform has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business and will continue to allow us to pursue a broader array of customers as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
we believe that our projected sales growth will come from both sales to new customers and an increase in the number of products that we sell to existing customers 
we expect that most of this sales growth will occur in our lower gross margin supernatural and conventional supermarket channels 
although sales to these customers typically generate lower gross margins than sales to customers within our independent retailer channel  they also typically carry a lower average cost to serve than sales to our independent customers 
we also believe that food price inflation similar to the levels experienced in the second half of fiscal will contribute to our projected net sales growth in fiscal gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a 
table of contents percentage of net sales was for the year ended july  and for the year ended july  the change in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the change in the mix of net sales by channel that began during the second quarter of fiscal as well as higher inventory shrink related to perishable items and improper storage of products in certain categories  and use of third parties for inbound freight during fiscal  partially offset by higher fuel surcharge revenue during the year ended july  our gross profits are generally higher on net sales to independently owned retailers and lower on net sales in the conventional supermarket and the supernatural channels 
for the year ended july  approximately million of our total net sales growth of million was from increased net sales in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels 
as a result  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal were to the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels compared to approximately in fiscal this change in sales mix from to resulted in lower gross profits as a percentage of sales during fiscal we anticipate net sales growth in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels will continue to outpace growth in the independent and other channels 
we expect that our growth with whole foods market and our opportunities in the conventional supermarket channel will continue to generate lower gross profit percentages than our historical rates  particularly during the time period when we are on boarding new business and incurring costs of hiring and training additional associates and increasing inventory levels before a new customer has reached expected purchasing levels 
we will seek to fully offset these reductions in gross profit percentages by reducing our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily through improved efficiencies in our supply chain and improvements to our information technology infrastructure 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended july  was primarily due to higher sales volume  million of severance and other restructuring expenses associated with the divestiture of our conventional non food and general merchandise lines of business and million in start up expenses incurred in connection with onboarding a large national conventional supermarket customer 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included million in restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with the divestiture of our conventional non foods and general merchandise lines of business 
total operating expenses for fiscal include share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in fiscal share based compensation expense for the years ended july  and july  includes approximately million and million  respectively  in expense related to performance share based awards granted to our chief executive officer related to certain financial goals for those various periods ended july  and july  during fiscal  million was recognized related to a new performance based equity compensation arrangement with a year performance based vesting component that was established for members of our executive leadership team 
see note equity plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended july   from approximately for the year ended july  the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in the supernatural and conventional supermarket channels which in general have lower operating expenses  higher fixed cost coverage due to higher sales  as well as expense control programs across all of our 
table of contents divisions 
we were able to manage our fuel costs despite rising prices by locking in the price of a portion of our expected fuel usage  updating and revising existing routes to reduce miles traveled  reducing idle times and other similar measures 
our expansion into lancaster  texas  where our facility began servicing customers in late september  has helped to further reduce our fuel costs as a percentage of net sales as we are able to reduce the number of miles traveled to serve our customers in texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana who were previously primarily served from our facility in denver  colorado 
these improvements in our operating expenses were offset in part by higher health insurance costs  higher workers compensation costs and the above described higher share based compensation costs 
we expect that we will be able to continue to reduce our operating expenses as we continue the roll out of our supply chain initiatives including a national warehouse management and procurement system  which was first launched in the lancaster  texas facility in september  launched in the ridgefield  washington facility in july and is expected to be rolled out in all of our distribution centers by the end of fiscal operating income operating income increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to sales growth and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during fiscal compared to fiscal other expense income other expense income increased million to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  interest expense for the year ended july  decreased to million from million in the year ended july   but was negatively impacted by million related to the settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the interest rate swap that we entered into in july in connection with our term loan that we paid off in may the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average debt levels during the year

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate for the year ended july  is primarily due to increases in effective state tax rates 
our effective income tax rate in both fiscal years was also affected by share based compensation for incentive stock options and the timing of disqualifying dispositions of certain share based compensation awards 
certain incentive stock option expenses are not deductible for tax purposes unless a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option and within two years of original grant 
we receive a tax benefit in the period that the disqualifying disposition occurs 
our effective income tax rate will continue to be effected by the tax impact related to incentive stock options and the timing of tax benefits related to disqualifying dispositions 
net income reflecting the factors described in more detail above  net income increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share on a lower share base  for the year ended july  liquidity and capital resources in october  we completed a secondary public offering of our common stock 
as a result   shares of common stock  including shares issued to cover the underwriters overallotment option  were issued at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million 
table of contents were used to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under our then existing revolving credit facility 
we finance our day to day operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  operating leases  trade payables and bank indebtedness 
in addition  from time to time  we may issue equity and debt securities to finance our operations and acquisitions 
we believe that our cash on hand and available credit through our amended and restated revolving credit facility as discussed below is sufficient for our operations and planned capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
we expect to generate an average of million to million in cash flow from operations per year for the and fiscal years 
we intend to continue to utilize this cash generated from operations to pay down our debt levels  and fund working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we intend to manage capital expenditures to no more than approximately of net sales for fiscal in may  we amended and restated our revolving credit facility  pursuant to which we now have a million revolving credit facility which matures on may   of which up to million is available to the company s us subsidiaries and up to million is available to unfi canada 
this credit facility also provides a one time option  subject to approval by the lenders under the revolving credit facility  to increase the borrowing base by up to an additional million 
the borrowings of the us portion of the credit facility accrue interest  at our option  at either i a base rate generally defined as the highest of x the bank of america business capital prime rate  y the average overnight federal funds effective rate plus one half percent per annum and z one month libor plus one percent per annum plus an initial margin of  or ii libor for one  two  three or six months or  if approved by all affected lenders  nine months plus an initial margin of 
the borrowings on the canadian portion of the credit facility for canadian swing line loans  canadian overadvance loans or canadian protective advances accrue interest  at our option  at either i a prime rate generally defined as the highest of x over day reuters canadian deposit offering rate for bankers acceptances  y the prime rate of bank of america  na s canada branch  and z a bankers acceptance equivalent rate for a one month interest period plus plus an initial margin of  or ii the cdor rate  and an initial margin of 
all other borrowings on the canadian portion of the credit facility must exclusively accrue interest under the cdor rate plus the applicable margin 
the revolving credit facility supports our working capital requirements in the ordinary course of business and provides capital to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
our borrowing base is determined as the lesser of million or the fixed percentages of our previous fiscal month end eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels 
as of july   our borrowing base  which was calculated based on our eligible accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million 
as of july   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  million in letter of credit commitments and million in reserves which reduces our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
our resulting remaining availability was million as of july  the revolving credit facility  as amended and restated  subjects us to a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the underlying credit agreement of to calculated at the end of each of our fiscal quarters on a rolling four quarter basis when aggregate availability as defined in the underlying credit agreement is less than the greater of i million and ii of the aggregate borrowing base 
we were not subject to fixed charge coverage ratio covenants as of the fiscal year ended july  our amended and restated revolving credit facility includes borrowing rates that are approximately to basis points higher than our prior revolving credit facility  depending on remaining availability 
however  we do not expect our overall interest expense to increase significantly if rates remain relatively stable as we have terminated our higher fixed rate interest rate swap  which covered our term loan 

table of contents in connection with the amended and restated revolving credit facility above  we used a portion of our availability to pay off our term loan agreement  which was maturing on july  at that time  our interest rate swap entered into in july was settled concurrently with a payment of million which is reflected within interest expense during the fiscal year ended july  our capital expenditures for the fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was partially due to a decision to delay certain construction related projects until fiscal we believe that our capital requirements for fiscal will be between and million 
we expect to finance these requirements with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our planned capital projects will provide both additional warehouse space including through the build out of our new aurora  colorado facility and technology that we believe will provide us with increased efficiency and the capacity to continue to support the growth of our customer base 
we believe that our future capital requirements after fiscal will be marginally lower than our anticipated fiscal requirements  as a percentage of net sales  although we plan to continue to invest in technology and expand our facilities 
future investments and acquisitions will be financed through our revolving credit facility  or with the issuance of equity or long term debt  negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july   an increase of million from the million provided by operations for the year ended july  the primary reasons for the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended july  were net income of million  partially offset by an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million due to our sales growth during the year  and in the case of accounts receivable  in part due to the longer credit terms typically granted to conventional supermarket and canadian customers 
net cash provided by operations of million for the year ended july  was primarily the result of an increase in net income  partially offset by changes in working capital 
days in inventory was days at july   compared to days at july  days sales outstanding remained at days at july  and july  working capital increased by million  or  to million at july   compared to working capital of million at july   primarily as a result of the refinance of our revolving credit facility which is now reflected as a long term liability 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended july   compared to million for the year ended july  the decrease from the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to the purchase of the rocky mountain and southwest distribution business of whole foods distribution  a wholly owned subsidiary of whole foods market  during the year ended july  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended july   primarily as a result of the purchase of the sdg assets from sunopta  as well as capital expenditures related to our lancaster  texas facility including the supply chain initiatives related to warehouse management software which went live with that facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended july   primarily due to repayments on long term debt of million as we paid off our term loan with availability under our amended and restated revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july   primarily due to net proceeds from our secondary equity offering of million  partially offset by repayments on borrowings on notes payable of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july   primarily due to borrowings under notes payable of million 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as part of the stock repurchase program  we purchased  shares of our common stock for our treasury during the year ended july  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
all shares were 
table of contents purchased at prevailing market prices 
no such purchases were made subsequent to the fiscal year  and the authorization to repurchase has expired 
in an effort to reduce the treasury share balance  we decided in the fourth quarter of fiscal to issue treasury shares to satisfy certain share requirements related to exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and awards under our equity incentive plans 
during the fiscal year ended july   we reissued  shares from treasury related to stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units and awards 
during the fiscal year ended july   we reissued  shares from treasury related to stock option exercises 
we may from time to time enter into commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk associated with our anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
these commodity swap agreements hedge a portion of our expected fuel usage for the periods set forth in the agreements 
we monitor the commodity nymex heating oil used in our swap agreements to determine that the correlation between the commodity and diesel fuel is deemed to be highly effective 
during the fiscal years ended july  and july   we had no outstanding commodity swap agreements 
in addition to the previously discussed interest rate and commodity swap agreements  from time to time we enter into fixed price fuel supply agreements 
as of july   we had entered into agreements which required us to purchase a total of approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at prices ranging from to per gallon through july as of july   we had not entered into any agreements requiring us to purchase diesel fuel 
these fixed price fuel agreements qualified for the normal purchase exception under asc  derivatives and hedging as physical deliveries will occur rather than net settlements  therefore the fuel purchases under these contracts will be expensed as incurred and included within operating expenses

we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million at july  seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
as more fully described in note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k  we have used interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
during the fiscal year ended july   we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement entered into in july the swap  which was set to expire in july concurrent with the maturity of our term loan 
the swap was terminated in connection with our repayment of all borrowings under the term loan during the fourth quarter of fiscal the swap had an initial notional principal amount of million and provided for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of while receiving interest for the same period at one month libor on the same notional principal amount 
the swap had an amortizing notional amount which adjusted down on the dates payments were due on the underlying term loan 
the swap had been entered into as a hedge against libor movements on current variable rate indebtedness at one month libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
we accounted for the swap using hedge accounting treatment because the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item 
under this method of accounting  we had recorded a liability of million representing the fair value of the swap as of july  there was no liability recorded as of july  due to the settlement of the swap in conjunction with the payoff of the underlying term loan in may we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt under our amended and restated revolving credit facility of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term borrowings 
at july   we had long term floating rate debt of million and long term fixed rate debt of million  representing and  respectively  of our long term borrowings 
holding other debt levels constant  a basis point decrease in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately  and  at july  and july   respectively
