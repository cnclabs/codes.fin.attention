in an effort to help entrepreneurs and small business owners achieve success  in fiscal we launched a new website  buildmybiz 
com  that provides tools and resources for starting  growing  and managing a business 
markets and competition we remain focused on servicing small to medium sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve 
industry data indicates there are approximately ten million employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the us of those employers  greater than have fewer than employees and are our primary customers and target market 
we serve a diverse base of small to medium sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the us and in germany 
as of may   we serviced approximately  payroll clients 
we utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice 
for fiscal  client retention was approximately of our beginning client base  up from for fiscal no single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations 
the composition of the us market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows business size number of employees estimated market distribution paychex  inc distribution of client base based on currently available market data from dun bradstreet 
the market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented 
our primary national competitor  adp automatic data processing  inc  is the largest us third party provider of payroll processing and human resource services in terms of revenue 
we compete with other national  regional  local  and online service providers  all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us 
in addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers  we compete with in house payroll and human resource systems and departments 
payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors 
our human resource services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services  such as retirement services companies  insurance companies  and human resources and benefits consulting firms 
competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness  product quality and reputation  breadth of service and product offering  and price 
we believe we are competitive in each of these areas 

table of contents software maintenance and development the ever changing mandates of federal  state  and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients

where it is determined to be appropriate  we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  confidentiality non disclosure agreements or policies with employees  vendors  and others  license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property  and registration of certain trademarks 
we believe that the paychex name  trademark  and logo are of material importance to us 
seasonality there is no significant seasonality to our business 
however  during our third fiscal quarter  which ends in february  the number of new payroll clients  new retirement services clients  and new paychex hr solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year  primarily because a majority of new clients begin using our services at the beginning of a calendar year 
in addition  calendar year end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year end bonuses and requesting additional year end services 
historically  as a result of these factors  our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter  with greater sales commission expenses also reported in the third quarter

table of contents item a 
risk factors our future results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results  and from our projections 
risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to understanding our business 
the risks described below are not the only risks we face 
additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may adversely affect  to a material extent  our business  cash flows  financial condition  or results of operations in future periods 
in addition  you should refer to the description of forward looking statements at the beginning of part i of this form k 
our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies many of our services  particularly payroll tax administration services and employee benefit plan administration services  are designed according to government regulations that continually change 
changes in regulations could affect the extent and type of benefits employers are required  or may choose  to provide employees or the amount and type of taxes employers and employees are required to pay 
such changes could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue 
added requirements could also increase our cost of doing business 
failure to educate and assist our clients regarding new or revised legislation that impacts them could have an adverse impact on our reputation 
failure by us to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our clients and our business could be adversely impacted by health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted on march  the ppaca was subsequently modified by the heath care and education reconciliation act of on march  together with ppaca hereafter referred to as the act 
the act entails sweeping health care reforms with staggered effective dates from through  and many provisions of the act require the issuance of additional guidance from the us departments of labor and heath human services  the internal revenue service the irs  and the states 
the complexity of federal and state regulations facing employers has continued to increase over time  including the enactment of the act 
as a service provider  we have a responsibility to our clients to help them understand and adapt to these increased regulations 
however  we are currently unable to determine the impacts to our clients and our business of the required plan changes and provisions resulting from the act 
also  as a co employer in our peo  we assume or share many of the employer related responsibilities and assist our clients in complying with many employment related governmental regulations 
within this business  the changes may result in increased costs  limit or delay our ability to increase service fees to offset such increased costs  and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
our interest earned on funds held for clients may be impacted by changes in government regulations mandating the amount of tax withheld or timing of remittance we receive interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees 
a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to applicable tax or regulatory agencies would adversely impact this interest income 
we may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services to maintain our growth strategy  we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal use systems  particularly our systems that meet our clients requirements 
we continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology 
if our systems become outdated  we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to update and integrate systems will be successful 
if we do not integrate and update our systems in a timely manner  or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results  there could be a material adverse effect to our business and results of operations 

table of contents our business and reputation may be affected by security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure  which could compromise company and customer information we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process  transmit  and store electronic information  and to support a variety of business processes 
vulnerabilities  threats  and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks  and the confidentiality  availability  and integrity of our data 
while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of security measures and constantly updating and adapting security requirements  our networks  products  and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats 
if we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach of our systems  the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business involves the use of significant amounts of private and confidential client information including employees identification numbers  bank accounts  and retirement account information 
this information is critical to the accurate and timely provision of services to our clients  and certain information may be transmitted via the internet 
this information could be compromised by a cyber attack 
there is no guarantee that our systems and processes are adequate to protect against all security breaches 
if our systems are disrupted or fail for any reason  or if our systems are infiltrated by unauthorized persons  both the company and our clients could experience data loss  financial loss  harm to reputation  or significant business interruption 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by disruptions or security breaches in the future 
such events may expose us to unexpected liability  litigation  regulation investigation and penalties  loss of clients business  unfavorable impact to business reputation  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be adversely impacted by any failure of third party service providers to perform their functions as part of providing services to clients  we rely on a number of third party service providers 
these service providers include  but are not limited to  couriers used to deliver client payroll checks and banks used to electronically transfer funds from clients to their employees 
failure by these service providers  for any reason  to deliver their services in a timely manner could result in material interruptions to our operations  impact client relations  and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us 
we may be exposed to additional risks related to our co employment relationship within our peo business many federal and state laws that apply to the employer employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of the co employment relationship 
as a result  there is a possibility that we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients and acts or omissions of client employees  who may be deemed to be our agents  even if we do not participate in any such acts or violations 
although our agreements with the clients provide that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees conduct  we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual obligations 
in addition  we could be subject to liabilities with respect to our employee benefit plans if it were determined that we are not the employer under any applicable state or federal laws 
we may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers compensation rates and underlying claims trends within our peo business  we maintain health and workers compensation insurance covering worksite employees 
the insurance costs are impacted by claims experience and are a significant portion of our peo direct costs 
if we experience a sudden and unexpected increase in claims activity  our costs could increase 
in addition  in the event of expiration or cancellation of existing contracts  we may not be able to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms 
increases in costs not incorporated into service fees timely or fully  could have a material adverse effect 
incorporating cost increases into service fees could also impact our ability to attract and retain clients 
we may be adversely impacted by volatility in the financial and economic environment during periods of weak economic conditions  employment levels tend to decrease and interest rates may become more volatile 
these conditions may impact our business due to lower transaction volumes or an increase in the number of clients going out of business 
current or potential clients may decide to reduce their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services 
in addition  new business formation may be affected by an inability to obtain credit 
the interest we earn on funds held for clients may decrease as a result of a decline in funds available to invest and lower interest rates 
in addition  during periods of volatility in the credit markets  certain types of 
table of contents investments may not be available to us or may become too risky for us to invest in  further reducing the interest we may earn on client funds 
constriction in the credit markets may impact the availability of financing  even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings 
we historically have not borrowed against available credit arrangements to meet liquidity needs 
however  should we require additional short term liquidity during days of large outflows of client funds  a credit constriction may limit our ability to access those funds or the flexibility to obtain them at interest rates that would be acceptable to us 
if all of these financial and economic circumstances were to remain in effect for an extended period of time  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the event of a catastrophe  our business continuity plan may fail  which could result in the loss of client data and adversely interrupt operations our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster  severe weather including events resulting from climate change  unauthorized security breach  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attack  or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations 
we have a business continuity plan in place in the event of system failure due to any of these events 
our business continuity plan has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather  including floods and snowstorms  and has been successful 
however  these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future 
if the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario  we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients

our financial results for fiscal reflected sustained growth in our business 
our key business indicators of checks per payroll and revenue per check continued to show improvement 
checks per payroll grew for fiscal this growth is slightly less than the growth of for fiscal  as expected 
our revenue growth has been moderate  as new business formation remains challenged 
our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment 
the equity markets hit a low in march  with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time 
the federal funds rate has been at a range of zero to since december our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal highlights of our financial results for fiscal compared to fiscal are as follows payroll service revenue increased to billion 
human resource services revenue increased to million 
interest on funds held for clients decreased to million 
total revenue increased to billion 
operating income increased to million  and operating income  net of certain items  increased to million 
refer to the non gaap financial measure discussion on the following page for further information on operating income  net of certain items 
net income and diluted earnings per share each increased to million and per share  respectively 
dividends of million were paid to stockholders  representing of net income 
our results for fiscal benefited from the inclusion of surepayroll  inc surepayroll  a provider of payroll processing for small businesses  acquired on february   and eplan services  inc eplan  a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace  acquired on may  these acquisitions in fiscal and an immaterial business acquisition in fiscal contributed approximately in total revenue growth for fiscal 
table of contents non gaap financial measure in addition to reporting operating income  a united states us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure  we present operating income  net of certain items  which is a non gaap measure 
we believe operating income  net of certain items  is an appropriate additional measure  as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period 
it is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year s targets and measuring management s performance in connection with certain performance based compensation payments and awards 
operating income  net of certain items  excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal to increase the litigation reserve 
interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates  which are not within the control of management 
the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature 
it is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period 
operating income  net of certain items  is not calculated through the application of gaap and is not the required form of disclosure by the securities and exchange commission 
as such  it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of operating income and  therefore  should not be used in isolation  but in conjunction with the gaap measure 
the use of any non gaap measure may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies 
business outlook our client base totaled approximately  clients as of may   compared to approximately  clients as of may   and approximately  clients as of may  our client base increased for fiscal  compared to an increase of for fiscal and a decline of for fiscal our organic client base growth was essentially flat for fiscal and declined for fiscal for fiscal  payroll services client retention was approximately of our beginning client base  a return to historical levels

financial position and liquidity the supply of high credit quality securities has been limited with the continued volatility in the global financial markets  thereby limiting our investment choices 
despite this macroeconomic environment  our financial position as of may  remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of million and no debt 
our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity 
yields on high quality financial instruments remain low  negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments 
we invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds  pre refunded bonds  which are secured by a us government escrow  and essential services revenue bonds 
during fiscal  our primary short term investment vehicles were high quality variable rate demand notes vrdns and federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured deposit accounts 
a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a p ratings on short term securities 
we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we believe that our investments as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired  nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other than temporary impairment 
our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations 
cash flow from operations was million for fiscal historically  we have funded our operations  capital purchases  business acquisitions  and dividend payments from our operating activities 
our positive cash flows in fiscal allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders

the following factors contributed to the growth for fiscal and fiscal paychex hr solutions revenue was positively impacted by favorable trends in checks per payroll  price increases  and growth in both clients and client employees 
the rate of growth for paychex hr solutions revenue for fiscal was adversely impacted by fewer client employees within our peo and lower average revenue per employee in our paychex hr essentials product 
insurance services revenue benefited from the continuing growth in health and benefits services revenue and increases in both clients and premiums for workers compensation insurance services 
health and benefits services revenue increased to million for fiscal and to million for fiscal  primarily driven by the increases for the respective periods in the number of applicants 
products that primarily support our mms clients through our saas solution continue to experience growth in clients and revenue 
retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the average asset value of retirement services client employees funds excluding eplan for both fiscal and fiscal this was partially offset by the impact from a shift in the mix of assets within these funds to investments earning lower fees from external managers 
human resource services revenue growth is less predictable than our payroll revenue growth

organic service revenue growth was approximately for fiscal and for fiscal interest on funds held for clients interest on funds held for clients decreased for fiscal and for fiscal compared to the respective prior year periods 
these declines were the result of lower average interest rates earned  partially offset by an increase in average investment balances 
average investment balances for funds held for clients increased for fiscal and for fiscal the increase for fiscal was the result of the inclusion of surepayroll client funds  wage inflation  increase in state unemployment insurance rates  and the increase in checks per payroll 
the increase in average investment balances for fiscal was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll  offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base

organic growth in combined operating and sg a expenses exclusive of acquisitions and the aforementioned million expense charge in fiscal was approximately for fiscal and for fiscal increases in product innovation and the supporting technology contributed to the increases in total expenses 
expenses related to information technology increased at a faster pace than total expenses for both fiscal and fiscal improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have moderated these increases 

table of contents compensation related costs for fiscal were impacted by increased headcount in areas supporting our development of technology  and higher employee related costs for health care and k employer match 
in addition  the increase in expenses for fiscal was primarily driven by personnel related costs  in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and k employer match during fiscal  along with one time costs related to the separation agreement entered into with jonathan j 
judge  our former president and chief executive officer 
as of may  and  we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  employees as of may  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business

depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal and fiscal due to business acquisitions 
other expenses include items such as delivery  forms and supplies  communications  travel and entertainment  equipment costs  professional services  and other costs incurred to support our business 
the increase in other expenses for fiscal and fiscal was primarily attributable to the inclusion of our acquisitions

the increases in investment income were primarily the result of higher average invested balances 
average investment balances increased for fiscal and for fiscal the increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations  partially offset by the impact on balances of cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of surepayroll and eplan during the second half of fiscal fiscal benefited from a slight increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments that was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer term investment portfolio compared to the prior year 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily the result of changes in state apportionment and lower levels of tax exempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios

we anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of may   along with projected operating cash flows  will support our normal business operations  capital purchases  and dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
commitments and contractual obligations lines of credit as of may   we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february bank of america  na million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex  inc and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 
the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary 
no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal or as of may  jp morgan chase bank  na and bank of america  na are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit  which are discussed below 
letters of credit as of may   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million  required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies 
the letters of credit expire at various dates between july and december  and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios 
no amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal or as of may  subsequent to may   the letter of credit expiring in july was renewed and will expire in july

amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately million as of may  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for more information on income taxes 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to this liability and have excluded it from the table above 
we are currently under a state income tax audit for the fiscal years ended may  through on july   we received a summary of proposed tax adjustments from the new york state department of taxation and finance  which was in excess of the reserve recorded as of may  the outcome of the audit and the timing of settlement  if any  are subject to significant uncertainty 
it is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact  if any  if resolution is ultimately unfavorable to us 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets amounting to million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage payroll services inc advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices associates  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services 
under these arrangements  advantage pays the associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients 
when we acquired advantage  there were fifteen associates 
over the past few years  arrangements with some associates have been discontinued  and there are currently fewer than ten associates 
since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain  obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above 
commission expense for the associates for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
historically  there have been no material losses related to such guarantees 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  which require us to defend and  if necessary  indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us 
we currently self insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans 
our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
historically  the amounts accrued have not been material 
we also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability  errors and omissions  warranty liability  theft and embezzlement  and acts of terrorism  and capacity for deductibles and self insured retentions through our captive insurance company 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes

the increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal resulted mainly from increases in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities 
the fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation  peo payroll  income tax  and other liabilities

corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
the portfolio of funds held for clients and corporate investments is detailed in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal is largely due to timing within the client funds portfolio  as there was a large inflow of collections on may  that was invested primarily in short term investments on that date 
see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 
in addition  we increased our investment in longer term available for sale securities within our corporate portfolio in fiscal the fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal as compared to fiscal was related to the mix of investment securities 
in fiscal  we continued to increase our investment in vrdns and the amounts of purchases and sales for available for sale securities increased 
however  partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing of remittances within the funds held for clients portfolio as compared to collections surrounding the fiscal year end 
see further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations 

table of contents in general  fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases  sales  or maturities of investments 
the amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds  and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services 
additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the market risk factors section  contained in item a of this form k

collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of timing of collections and remittances as may  fell on a thursday  a large collection day for direct pay funds 
these funds were then paid out on friday  june  in  may fell on a tuesday  and there were fewer collections from clients on that day 
in addition  overall client fund balances were higher on average for fiscal than for fiscal the fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal as compared to fiscal is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the federal holiday on may   offset by an increase in average client collections primarily due to higher state unemployment insurance rates 
as may  was a federal holiday  client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on friday  may  that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until june this resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal may  did not fall on a federal holiday  so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal dividends paid in october  the board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by to per share from per share 
a quarterly dividend of per share was paid to stockholders of record during the first quarter of fiscal and the fiscal years and the dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled   and for those respective fiscal years 
the payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our board 

table of contents exercise of stock options proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock based awards increased for both fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior years 
common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were million shares for fiscal and million shares for both fiscal and the increase in proceeds for fiscal was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal or refer to note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for additional disclosures on our stock based compensation incentive plans 
other recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements

refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted from one to days after receipt  with some items extending to days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collecting  holding  and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including economic 
table of contents trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have million and million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may  and may   respectively  resulting from acquisitions of businesses 
the increase in goodwill was due to an immaterial business acquisition during fiscal goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
during fiscal  we adopted guidance that allows us the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit has declined below carrying value 
this assessment considers various financial  macroeconomic  industry  and reporting unit specific qualitative factors 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment testing in our fiscal fourth quarter 
based on the results of our reviews  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal years   or subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation costs all stock based awards to employees  including grants of stock options  are recognized as compensation costs in our consolidated financial statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the paychex stock price and expected option life 
we estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices over a period equal to the expected option life and implied market volatility 
expected option life is estimated based on historical exercise behavior 
we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience 
forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified  with any adjustment recorded in the period of change  and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures 
the assumptions of volatility  expected option life  and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior  stock price trends  and changes to type or provisions of stock based awards 
any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of a future award 
we have determined that the black scholes option pricing model  as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application  is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants 
we periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model  and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value  or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which 
table of contents the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock based compensation costs recognized for certain stock based awards 
at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards  we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid in capital 
we currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock based awards 
we maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial statements  we must conclude that tax positions must be more likely than not to be sustained  assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the benefit recognized in our consolidated financial statements is the amount we expect to realize after examination by taxing authorities 
if a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment  and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit 
a change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
our total reserve for uncertain tax positions was million as of may  and million as of may  refer to note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k  for further discussion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities 
corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer term available for sale securities 
we follow an investment strategy of protecting principal and optimizing liquidity 
a substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with aaa and aa ratings and a p ratings on short term securities 
we invest predominately in municipal bonds general obligation bonds  pre refunded bonds  which are secured by a us government escrow  and essential services revenue bonds 
we limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short to intermediate term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes 
we manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
during fiscal  our primary short term investment vehicles were vrdns and fdic insured deposit accounts 
we have no exposure to high risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities  sub prime mortgage securities  asset backed securities or asset backed commercial paper  collateralized debt obligations  enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds  or structured investment vehicles sivs 
we have insignificant exposure to european investments 
we have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was  compared with for fiscal and for fiscal when interest rates are falling  the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short and long term interest rate changes 
during a falling interest rate environment  the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short term investments  and over time decrease earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which as of may  had an average duration of years  would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates 
in the next twelve months  approximately to of our available for sale portfolio will mature  and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 

table of contents the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities that had stated maturities as of may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in millions amortized cost fair value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total vrdns are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically to years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  they are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature 
the federal funds rate remained at a range of zero to throughout fiscal years   and calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportion of taxable and tax exempt investments  changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous  and financial market volatility and the resulting effect on benchmark and other indexing interest rates 
subject to these factors and under normal financial market conditions  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
under normal financial market conditions  the impact to earnings from a basis point change in short term interest rates would be in the range of million to million  after taxes  for a twelve month period 
such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the federal funds rate 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for fiscal our anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and vrdns with an average duration of less than days  and invested in available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
for fiscal  we anticipate our average duration on our available for sale securities will increase to over three years 
the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of million as of may   compared with an unrealized gain of million as of may  in determining fair value  we utilize the interactive data pricing service 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from million to million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from million to million 
the net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately million as of july  as of may  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at fair value 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and as of may  and may   respectively 
the weighted average yield to maturity excludes available for sale securities tied to short term interest rates such as the vrdns held as of may  and assuming a hypothetical decrease 
table of contents in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available for sale securities as of may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value 
this hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity 
these fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations  unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other than temporary and an impairment loss recognized 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that the investments we held as of may  were not other than temporarily impaired 
while million of our available for sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost  we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms  and that the unrealized loss of million was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns 
substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of may  and held an aa rating or better 
we do not intend to sell these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity  and further believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments prior to that time 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment
