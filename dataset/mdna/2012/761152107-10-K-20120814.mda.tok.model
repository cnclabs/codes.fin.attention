item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc and subsidiaries 
it is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
we are a leading developer  manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating  diagnosing  and managing sleep disordered breathing sdb and other respiratory disorders 
during the fiscal year  we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market 
in our efforts  we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on co morbidities such as cardiac disease  diabetes  hypertension and obesity 
in march  the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes  recommending that screening for sdb osa be done in adults with type diabetes  especially men older than years 
the national institutes of health released a clinical study in april reporting that obstructive sleep apnea  osa  is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middle aged and older adults  especially men 
in a recently released study in circulation  it was reported that osa is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middle aged and older men 
specifically  men ages to with ahi were more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi in march  the american association of clinical endocrinologists published updated medical guidelines for developing a comprehensive care plan for patients with diabetes  which recommended that screening  for osa  be done in adults with type diabetes  especially men older than years 
there are many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sdb and osa can improve health  quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety  especially in the transport industry 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements 
during fiscal year  we invested approximately million on research and development activities  which represents of net revenues 
since the development of cpap  we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators  diagnostic products  mask systems  headgear and other accessories 
during fiscal year  we released new products across both our mask and flow generator categories 
we have introduced new masks during fiscal  including the quattro fx for her  swift fx bella and pixi pediatric mask 
additionally  the release of s bilevel range of flow generators as well as stellar and ventilation devices in fiscal  have all contributed to the increase in our net revenues for fiscal year we reported record financial results in fiscal year  with an increase in net revenue to  million  an increase of when compared to fiscal year gross profit increased for the year ended june  to million from million for the year ended june   an increase of million or

overdraft facility during the year ended june   resmed uk limited  our wholly owned uk subsidiary  obtained access to an overdraft facility with hsbc bank plc that provides for an overdraft facility up to a total commitment of million euros 
hsbc may at any time withdraw the overdraft facility and or demand repayment of all sums owing to it 
at june   there were no amounts outstanding under this facility 
we expect to satisfy all of our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal years  and during fiscal years  and  our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend on  numerous factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which an additional australian tax deduction is available  the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in 
table of contents the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory adjustments  warranty obligations  goodwill  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  deferred tax valuation allowances and stock based compensation costs 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs depends on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 
we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal the results of our annual review indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value 

table of contents income tax 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
where we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
these changes to the valuation allowance  and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense  could have a material effect on our operating results 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision 
revenue recognition 
we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment  when title transfers to the customer 
we do not record revenue on product sales that require customer acceptance until we receive acceptance 
we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract 
we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract 
otherwise  we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract 
we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers 
we charge all freight related expenses to cost of sales 
taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions  such as sales and value added taxes  are excluded from revenue 
we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products  other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims 
we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
therefore  we have no significant installation obligations 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we measure the compensation cost of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant 
we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options 
we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends 
while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we use historical rates by employee groups 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations  financial positions and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we are not involved in any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and business risks foreign currency market risk our reporting currency is the us dollar  although the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries are maintained in their respective local currencies 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
we have significant foreign currency exposure through both our australian and singapore manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options and forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing cash flows 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically manage the financial impact of foreign currency exposures predominantly denominated in euros  australian dollars and singapore dollars 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the foreign currency derivatives portfolio is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and included in other assets or other liabilities 
all movements in the fair value of the foreign currency derivatives are recorded within other income  net  on our consolidated statements of income
