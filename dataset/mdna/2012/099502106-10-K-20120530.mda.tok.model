contracts our portfolio of contracts is highly diversified consisting of a range of contract vehicles though which our clients may contract for our services  with no single contract accounting for more than of our revenue in any of fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal  and no single task order under any contract accounting for more than of our revenue in any of fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal there are two predominant contracting methods by which the us government procures services definite contracts and indefinite contract vehicles 
each of these is described below definite contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products 
the us government procures services and solutions through single award  definite contracts that specify the scope of services that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services 
when an agency recognizes a need for services or products  it develops an acquisition plan  which details the means by which it will procure those services or products 
during the acquisition process  the agency may release a request for information to determine if qualified bidders exist  a draft request for a proposal to allow industry to comment on the scope of work and acquisition strategy  and finally a formal request for a proposal 
following the evaluation of submitted proposals  the agency will award the contract to the winning bidder 
indefinite contract vehicles provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the terms of the contract 
indefinite contracts are formally known as id iq contracts and are often referred to as contract vehicles or ordering contracts 
id iq contracts may be awarded to one contractor single award or several contractors multiple award 
under a multiple award id iq contract  there is no guarantee of work as contract holders must compete for individual work orders 
id iq contracts will often include pre established labor categories and rates  and the ordering process is streamlined usually taking less than a month from recognition of a need to an established order with a contractor 
id iq contracts often have multi year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts  thereby enabling but not committing the us government to purchase substantial amounts of products and services from one or more contractors in a streamlined procurement process 
gwacs and gsa schedules are id iq contracts that are open to all us government agencies 
contract holders compete for individual task orders under both types of id iq contract vehicles 
prices labor rates are pre established under gsa schedules  while prices under gwacs may be pre established or determined by task order proposal 
agencies may solicit companies directly under gsa schedules and  under gwacs  must work through the agency that operates the gwac or receive a delegation of authority to use the gwac 
gsa schedules are administered by the general services administration and support a wide range of products and services 
gwacs are used to procure it products and services and are administered by the agency soliciting the services or products  with permission from the office of management and budget

funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized  less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 
the following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog at the respective dates presented as of march  in millions funded unfunded priced options total backlog reflects a reduction by management to the revenue value of orders for services under two existing single award id iq contracts based on an established pattern of funding under these contracts by the us government 
amounts shown reflect of the undiscounted revenue value of all priced options 
we may never realize all of the revenue that is included in our total backlog  and there is a higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options

table of contents competition due to its size  the government consulting market is highly fragmented 
as certain commercial sectors of the consulting market have declined over the past few years  competition within the government professional services industry has intensified 
in addition to professional service companies like our own that focus principally on the provision of services to the us government  other companies active in our markets include large defense contractors  diversified service providers  and small businesses 
changing government policies and market dynamics are also helping to reshape the competitive landscape 
some large prime contractors are beginning to divest their professional services business units due to the us government s increased sensitivity to organizational conflicts of interest and these divested companies will be free to compete with us without their former organizational conflicts of interest constraints 
the formal adoption of the federal acquisition regulation  or far  organizational conflicts of interest rules or additional more restrictive rules by us government agencies could cause further such divestitures which could further increase competition in our markets 
at the other end of the spectrum are small businesses 
small businesses are growing in the government services industry due in large part to a push by both the obama and bush administrations to bolster the economy by helping small business owners 
finally  due to the foregoing factors and the drive in our markets to quickly build competencies in growth areas and achieve economies of scale  we believe that consolidation activity among market participants will increase 
in the course of doing business  we compete and collaborate with companies of all types

regulation as a contractor to the us government  as well as state and local governments  we are heavily regulated in most fields in which we operate 
we deal with numerous us government agencies and entities  and when working with these and other entities  we must comply with and are affected by unique laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
some significant laws and regulations that affect us include far  and agency regulations supplemental to the far  which regulate the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
for example  far requires contractors to establish a code of business ethics and conduct  implement a comprehensive internal control system  and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal  employee  agent  or subcontractor  in connection with a government contract  has violated certain federal criminal laws  violated the civil false claims act  or has received a significant overpayment  the false claims act and false statements act  which impose civil and criminal liability for presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or reimbursement  and making false statements to the us government  respectively  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract  modification  or task order  the procurement integrity act  which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and certain internal government procurement sensitive information  and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government procurement officials  post government employment laws and regulations  which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit  hire  and deploy former employees of the us government  laws  regulations  and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work  and 
table of contents the cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time 
given the magnitude of our revenue derived from contracts with the department of defense  the defense contract audit agency  or dcaa  is our cognizant government audit agency 
the dcaa audits the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies including  among other areas  compensation 
as a result of its audits  the dcaa may determine that a portion of our employee compensation is unallowable 
see item a 
risk factors risk related to our industry our contracts  performance and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits  reviews  investigations and cost adjustments by the us government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time 
in order to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  all of our employees are required to attend ethics training at least annually  as well as other compliance training relevant to their position 
internationally  we are subject to special us government laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act  local government regulations and procurement policies and practices  including regulations relating to import export control  investments  exchange controls  and repatriation of earnings  as well as varying currency  political  and economic risks 
us government contracts are  by their terms  subject to termination by the us government either for its convenience or default by the contractor 
in addition  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a september fiscal year basis  even though contract performance may take many years 
as is common in the industry  our company is subject to business risks  including changes in governmental appropriations  national defense policies  service modernization plans  and availability of funds 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our company s business with the us government in the future 
the us government has a broad range of actions that it can instigate in order to enforce its procurement policies 
these include proposing a contractor or certain of its operations for debarment or suspending or debarring a contractor or certain of its operations from future government business 
on february   our san antonio office was proposed for debarment by the us air force and listed on the government s excluded parties list system epls website 
although the government s action did not terminate ongoing work under existing contracts  it affected the ability of our san antonio office to attain new government business 
this matter arose from actions of a former government employee hired by us who inappropriately retained and shared sensitive information about a pending government procurement in violation of the company s policies and high standards of ethical conduct 
on april   our operating subsidiary  booz allen hamilton inc  entered in an administrative agreement with the us air force  which lifted the proposed debarment and removed our san antonio office from the us government s excluded parties list system 
as a result  our san antonio office is now eligible to compete for new contracts with the us federal government 
pursuant to the administrative agreement  we accepted responsibility for the incident that gave rise to the proposed debarment and related matters 
in addition  we agreed to implement firm wide enhancements to our ethics and compliance program  including future improvements identified by external advisors  to significantly mitigate the possibility of a re occurrence of such issues 
during the three year term of the administrative agreement  which begins on april  or  if the air force determines at any time during such three year period that the company is not fully compliant with the administrative agreement  from the reestablishment of full compliance as determined by the air force  we have agreed  among other things  to file quarterly reports with the air force regarding the implementation of our remedial measures and adhere to a number of provisions relating to enhanced disclosure of employee misconduct or violations of our ethics and compliance program

risk factors you should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below  as well as other information included in this annual report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of specific factors  including the risks and uncertainties described below 
risks related to our business we depend on contracts with us government agencies for substantially all of our revenue 
if our relationships with such agencies are harmed  our future revenue and operating profits would decline 
the us government is our primary client  with revenue from contracts and task orders  either as a prime or a subcontractor  with us government agencies accounting for of our revenue for fiscal our belief is that the successful future growth of our business will continue to depend primarily on our ability to be awarded work under us government contracts  as we expect this will be the primary source of all of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
for this reason  any issue that compromises our relationship with the us government generally or any us government agency that we serve would cause our revenue to decline 
among the key factors in maintaining our relationship with us government agencies are our performance on contracts and task orders  the strength of our professional reputation  compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and the strength of our relationships with client personnel 
in addition  the mishandling or the perception of mishandling of sensitive information  such as our failure to maintain the confidentiality of the existence of our business relationships with certain of our clients  could harm our relationship with us government agencies 
if a client is not satisfied with the quality or type of work performed by us  a subcontractor  or other third parties who provide services or products for a specific project  the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date  provide a negative assessment of our performance to government maintained contractor past performance data repositories  fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise  and direct future business to our competitors 
furthermore  we may incur additional costs to address any such 
table of contents situation and the profitability of that work might be impaired 
to the extent that our performance does not meet client expectations  or our reputation or relationships with any of our clients is impaired  our revenue and operating profits could materially decline 
us government spending and mission priorities could change in a manner that adversely affects our future revenue and limits our growth prospects 
our business depends upon continued us government expenditures on defense  intelligence  and civil programs for which we provide support 
these expenditures have not remained constant over time  have been reduced in certain periods and  recently  have been affected by the us government s efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting federal government programs generally 
our business  prospects  financial condition  or operating results could be materially harmed  among other causes  by the following budgetary constraints affecting us government spending generally  or specific agencies in particular  and changes in available funding  a shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support  reduced us government outsourcing of functions that we are currently contracted to provide  including as a result of increased insourcing  further efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting federal government programs  changes in us government programs that we support or related requirements  us government shutdowns due to a failure by elected officials to fund the government such as that which was threatened in march of or which occurred during government fiscal year or weather related closures in the washington  dc area such as that which occurred in february and other potential delays in the appropriations process  us government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis in order to reduce expenditures  delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices  an inability by the us government to fund its operations as a result of a failure to increase the federal government s debt ceiling  a credit downgrade of us government obligations or for any other reason  and changes in the political climate and general economic conditions  including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions  such as emergency spending  that reduce funds available for other government priorities 
the us government budget deficits  the national debt  and the prevailing economic condition  and actions taken to address them  could negatively affect the us government expenditures on defense  intelligence  and civil programs for which we provide support 
the department of defense is one of our significant clients and cost cutting  including through consolidation and elimination of duplicative organizations and insourcing  has become a major initiative for the department of defense 
in particular  in march  the secretary of defense announced that he has directed the department of defense to reduce funding for service support contractors by per year for the next three years 
furthermore  the budget control act of could impose an estimated billion in automatic federal defense spending cuts between and unless the federal government delays or changes this legislation 
a reduction in the amount of services that we are contracted to provide to the department of defense as a result of any of these related initiatives  legislation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
these or other factors could cause our defense  intelligence  or civil clients to decrease the number of new contracts awarded generally and fail to award us new contracts  reduce their purchases under our existing contracts  exercise their right to terminate our contracts  or not exercise options to renew our contracts  any of which could cause a material decline in our revenue 

table of contents we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations  some of which are highly complex  and our failure to comply could result in fines or civil or criminal penalties or suspension or debarment by the us government that could result in our inability to continue to work on or receive us government contracts  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as a us government contractor  we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts  which affect how we do business with our clients 
such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties  termination of our us government contracts  and or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies 
some significant laws and regulations that affect us include far  and agency regulations supplemental to the far  which regulate the formation  administration  and performance of us government contracts 
for example  far requires contractors to establish a code of business ethics and conduct  implement a comprehensive internal control system  and report to the government when the contractor has credible evidence that a principal  employee  agent  or subcontractor  in connection with a government contract  has violated certain federal criminal laws  violated the civil false claims act  or has received a significant overpayment  the false claims act and false statements act  which impose civil and criminal liability for presenting false or fraudulent claims for payments or reimbursement  and making false statements to the us government  respectively  the truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with the negotiation of a contract  modification  or task order  post government employment laws and regulations  which restrict the ability of a contractor to recruit  hire  and deploy former employees of the us government  laws  regulations  and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work  and the far cost accounting standards and cost principles  which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost based us government contracts and require consistency of accounting practices over time 
in addition  the us government adopts new laws  rules  and regulations from time to time that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
our performance under our us government contracts and our compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to periodic audit  review  and investigation by various agencies of the us government and the current environment has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and sanctions for non compliance by such agencies generally 
in addition  from time to time we report potential or actual violations of applicable laws and regulations to the relevant governmental authority 
any such report of a potential or actual violation of applicable laws or regulations could lead to an audit  review  or investigation by the relevant agencies of the us government 
if such an audit  review  or investigation uncovers a violation of a law or regulation  or improper or illegal activities relating to our us government contracts  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  including the termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  the triggering of price reduction clauses  withholding of payments  suspension of payments  fines and suspension  or debarment from contracting with us government agencies 
such penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in the industry and there is inherent uncertainty as to the outcome of any particular audit  review  or investigation 
if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation  our profitability  cash position  and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
further  if the us government were to initiate suspension or debarment proceedings against us or if we are indicted for or convicted of illegal activities relating to our us government contracts following an audit  review  
table of contents or investigation  we may lose our ability to be awarded contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts for a period of time which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we could also suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us  which would impair our ability to win awards of contracts in the future or receive renewals of existing contracts 
for example  on february   our san antonio office was proposed for debarment by the us air force and listed on the government s excluded parties list system due to the actions of one of our former employees who inappropriately retained and shared sensitive information with other professionals in that office 
the us air force has since lifted the proposed debarment and removed our san antonio office from the government s excluded parties list system 
see item business regulation for additional information 
we derive a majority of our revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process  and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively in the process or if there are delays caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us 
we derive a majority of our revenue from us government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes 
we do not expect this to change for the foreseeable future 
our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
the competitive bidding process involves risk and significant costs to businesses operating in this environment  including the necessity to expend resources  make financial commitments such as procuring leased premises and bid on engagements in advance of the completion of their design  which may result in unforeseen difficulties in execution  cost overruns and  in the case of an unsuccessful competition  the loss of committed costs  the substantial cost and managerial time and effort spent to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us  the ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded  the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding  and the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications  or in termination  reduction  or modification of the awarded contract  and any opportunity cost of bidding and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue 
in circumstances where contracts are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire  we still may not be provided the opportunity to bid on those contracts if the us government determines to extend the existing contract 
if we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process  we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for the duration of those contracts to the extent that there is no additional demand for such services 
an inability to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the current competitive environment has resulted in an increase in the number of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders 
it can take many months for the relevant us government agency to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive 
the resulting delay in the start up and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 

table of contents we may lose gsa schedules or our position as a prime contractor on one or more of our gwacs 
we believe that one of the key elements of our success is our position as the holder of gsa schedules  and as a prime contractor under two gwacs as of march  our ability to maintain our existing business and win new business depends on our ability to maintain our position as a gsa schedule contractor and a prime contractor on gwacs 
the loss of any of our gsa schedules or our prime contractor position on any of our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to win new business and our operating results 
in addition  if the us government elects to use a contract vehicle that we do not hold  we will not be able to compete for work under that contract vehicle as a prime contractor 
we may earn less revenue than projected  or no revenue  under certain of our contracts 
many of our contracts with our clients are id iq contracts  including gsa schedules and gwacs 
id iq contracts provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the contract  and often contain multi year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts  which allow but do not commit the us government to purchase products and services from contractors 
our ability to generate revenue under each of these types of contracts depends upon our ability to be awarded task orders for specific services by the client 
id iq contracts may be awarded to one contractor single award or several contractors multiple award 
multiple contractors must compete under multiple award id iq contracts for task orders to provide particular services  and contractors earn revenue only to the extent that they successfully compete for these task orders 
in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  our revenue under our gsa schedules and gwacs accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenue 
a failure to be awarded task orders under such contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate or otherwise recover the expenses  time  and resources for our contracts 
we enter into three general types of us government contracts for our services cost reimbursable  time and materials  and fixed price 
for fiscal  we derived of our revenue from cost reimbursable contracts  from time and materials contracts and from fixed price contracts 
each of these types of contracts  to varying degrees  involves the risk that we could underestimate our cost of fulfilling the contract  which may reduce the profit we earn or lead to a financial loss on the contract and adversely affect our operating results 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs up to a ceiling and paid a fee  which may be fixed or performance based 
if our actual costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations  we may not be able to recover those costs 
in particular  there is increasing focus by the us government on the extent to which government contractors  including us  are able to receive reimbursement for employee compensation 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain allowable expenses 
we assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because our costs of performance may exceed these negotiated hourly rates 
under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a pre determined price 
compared to time and materials and cost reimbursable contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities because we receive the benefits of any cost savings  but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns 
the us government has generally indicated that it intends to increase its use of fixed price contract procurements 
in addition  the department of defense adopted purchasing guidelines that mark a shift towards fixed priced procurement contracts under certain competitive conditions 
because we assume the risk for cost overruns and contingent losses on fixed price contracts  an increase in the percentage of fixed price contracts in our contract mix would increase our risk of suffering losses 

table of contents additionally  our profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract 
we have recorded provisions in our consolidated financial statements for losses on our contracts  as required under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  but our contract loss provisions may not be adequate to cover all actual losses that we may incur in the future 
our professional reputation is critical to our business  and any harm to our reputation could decrease the amount of business the us government does with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and growth prospects 
we depend on our contracts with us government agencies for substantially all of our revenue and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed  our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
our reputation and relationship with the us government is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under contracts with the us government 
negative press reports regarding poor contract performance  employee misconduct  information security breaches  or other aspects of our business  or regarding government contractors generally  could harm our reputation 
if our reputation with these agencies is negatively affected  or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason  such actions would decrease the amount of business that the us government does with us  which would have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and growth prospects 
we use estimates in recognizing revenue and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenue  our profitability may be adversely affected 
revenue from our fixed price contracts is primarily recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract 
revenue from our cost plus award fee contracts are based on our estimation of award fees over the life of the contract 
estimating costs at completion and award fees on our long term contracts is complex and involves significant judgment 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses  experience is gained  and additional information becomes known  even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change 
any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known 
in the event updated estimates indicate that we will experience a loss on the contract  we recognize the estimated loss at the time it is determined 
additional information may subsequently indicate that the loss is more or less than initially recognized  which requires further adjustments in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the underlying assumptions  circumstances  or estimates could result in adjustments that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we may not realize the full value of our backlog  which may result in lower than expected revenue 
as of march   our total backlog was billion  of which billion was funded 
we define backlog to include the following three components funded backlog 
funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized  less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 

table of contents backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 
we historically have not realized all of the revenue included in our total backlog  and we may not realize all of the revenue included in our total backlog in the future 
there is a somewhat higher degree of risk in this regard with respect to unfunded backlog and priced options 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our backlog will result in actual revenue in any particular period 
this is because the actual receipt  timing  and amount of revenue under contracts included in backlog are subject to various contingencies  including congressional appropriations  many of which are beyond our control 
in particular  delays in the completion of the us government s budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions could adversely affect our ability to timely recognize revenue under our contracts included in backlog 
furthermore  the actual receipt of revenue from contracts included in backlog may never occur or may be delayed because a program schedule could change or the program could be canceled  a contract s funding or scope could be reduced  modified  delayed  or terminated early  including as a result of a lack of appropriated funds or as a result of cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce us government spending such as the initiatives announced by the secretary of defense in march and the automatic federal defense spending cuts required by the budget control act of  in the case of funded backlog  the period of performance for the contract has expired  in the case of unfunded backlog  funding may not be available  or  in the case of priced options  our clients may not exercise their options 
in addition  consulting staff headcount growth is the primary means by which we are able to recognize revenue growth 
any inability to hire additional appropriately qualified personnel or failure to timely and effectively deploy such additional personnel against funded backlog could negatively affect our ability to grow our revenue 
furthermore  even if our backlog results in revenue  the contracts may not be profitable 
we may fail to attract  train and retain skilled and qualified employees with appropriate security clearances  which may impair our ability to generate revenue  effectively serve our clients  and execute our growth strategy 
our business depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly qualified individuals who may have advanced degrees in areas such as information technology as well as appropriate security clearances 
we compete for such qualified personnel with other us government contractors  the us government  and private industry  and such competition is intense 
personnel with the requisites skills  qualifications  or security clearance may be in short supply or generally unavailable 
in addition  our ability to recruit  hire  and internally deploy former employees of the us government is subject to complex laws and regulations  which may serve as an impediment to our ability to attract such former employees  and failure to comply with these laws and regulations may expose us and our employees to civil or criminal penalties 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  or fail to deploy such employees or obtain their appropriate security clearances in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and grow our business and to effectively serve our clients could be limited and our future revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  to the extent that we are unable to make necessary permanent hires to appropriately serve our clients  we could be required to engage larger numbers of contracted personnel  which could reduce our profit margins 
if we are able to attract sufficient numbers of qualified new hires  training and retention costs may place significant demands on our resources 
in addition  to the extent that we experience attrition in our employee ranks  we may realize only a limited or no return on such invested resources  and we would have to expend additional resources to hire and train replacement employees 
the loss of services of key personnel could also impair our ability to perform required services under some of our contracts and to retain such contracts  as well as our ability to win new business 

table of contents we may fail to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances which may adversely affect our ability to perform on certain contracts 
many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances 
depending on the level of required clearance  security clearances can be difficult and time consuming to obtain 
if we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances  we may not be able to win new business  and our existing clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them 
to the extent we are not able to obtain and maintain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract  we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts  or effectively rebid on expiring contracts  as well as lose existing contracts  which may adversely affect our operating results and inhibit the execution of our growth strategy 
our profitability could suffer if we are not able to timely and effectively utilize our employees 
the cost of providing our services  including the degree to which our employees are utilized  affects our profitability 
the degree to which we are able to utilize our employees is affected by a number of factors  including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire  assimilate  and deploy new employees  our ability to forecast demand for our services and to maintain and deploy headcount that is aligned with demand  including employees with the right mix of skills and experience to support our projects  our employees inability to obtain or retain necessary security clearances  our ability to manage attrition  and our need to devote time and resources to training  business development  and other non chargeable activities 
if our employees are under utilized  our profit margin and profitability could suffer 
additionally  if our employees are over utilized  it could have a material adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition  which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business 
we may lose one or more members of our senior management team or fail to develop new leaders  which could cause the disruption of the management of our business 
we believe that the future success of our business and our ability to operate profitably depends on the continued contributions of the members of our senior management and the continued development of new members of senior management 
we rely on our senior management to generate business and execute programs successfully 
in addition  the relationships and reputation that many members of our senior management team have established and maintain with our clients are important to our business and our ability to identify new business opportunities 
we do not have any employment agreements providing for a specific term of employment with any member of our senior management 
the loss of any member of our senior management or our failure to continue to develop new members could impair our ability to identify and secure new contracts  to maintain good client relations  and to otherwise manage our business 
our employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities  which could harm our ability to conduct business with the us government 
we are exposed to the risk that employee or subcontractor fraud or other misconduct could occur 
misconduct by employees or subcontractors could include intentional or unintentional failures to comply with us government procurement regulations  engaging in unauthorized activities  or falsifying time records 
employee or subcontractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients sensitive or classified 
table of contents information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or classified information 
it is not always possible to deter employee or subcontractor misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses  which could materially harm our business 
as a result of such misconduct  our employees could lose their security clearance and we could face fines and civil or criminal penalties  loss of facility clearance accreditation  and suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government  as well as reputational harm  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see  for example  item business regulation for a description of the recently resolved debarment proceedings against our san antonio office 
we face intense competition from many competitors  which could cause us to lose business  lower prices and suffer employee departures 
our business operates in a highly competitive industry  and we generally compete with a wide variety of us government contractors  including large defense contractors  diversified service providers  and small businesses 
we also face competition from entrants into our markets including companies divested by large prime contractors in response to increasing scrutiny of organizational conflicts of interest issues and from market participants formed by or benefiting from industry consolidation 
some of these companies possess greater financial resources and larger technical staffs  and others have smaller and more specialized staffs 
these competitors could  among other things divert sales from us by winning very large scale government contracts  a risk that is enhanced by the recent trend in government procurement practices to bundle services into larger contracts  force us to charge lower prices in order to win or maintain contracts  seek to hire our employees  or adversely affect our relationships with current clients  including our ability to continue to win competitively awarded engagements where we are the incumbent 
if we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower our prices or suffer employee departures  our revenue and our operating profits could decline 
in addition  we may face competition from our subcontractors who  from time to time  seek to obtain prime contractor status on contracts for which they currently serve as a subcontractor to us 
if one or more of our current subcontractors are awarded prime contractor status on such contracts in the future  it could divert sales from us and could force us to charge lower prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
our failure to maintain strong relationships with other contractors  or the failure of contractors with which we have entered into a sub or prime contractor relationship to meet their obligations to us or our clients  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
maintaining strong relationships with other us government contractors  who may also be our competitors  is important to our business and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition  and operating results 
to the extent that we fail to maintain good relations with our subcontractors or other prime contractors due to either perceived or actual performance failures or other conduct  they may refuse to hire us as a subcontractor in the future or to work with us as our subcontractor 
in addition  other contractors may choose not to use us as a subcontractor or choose not to perform work for us as a subcontractor for any number of additional reasons  including because they choose to establish relationships with our competitors or because they choose to directly offer services that compete with our business 
as a prime contractor  we often rely on other companies to perform some of the work under a contract  and we expect to continue to depend on relationships with other contractors for portions of our delivery of services 
table of contents and revenue in the foreseeable future 
if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations  our operating results and future growth prospects could be impaired 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  client concerns about the subcontractor  our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract  or our hiring of a subcontractor s personnel 
in addition  if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services on a timely basis  our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized 
material losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a client terminating a contract for default 
a termination for default could expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
we estimate that revenue derived from contracts under which we acted as a subcontractor to other companies represented of our revenue for fiscal as a subcontractor  we often lack control over fulfillment of a contract  and poor performance on the contract could tarnish our reputation  even when we perform as required  and could cause other contractors to choose not to hire us as a subcontractor in the future 
in addition  if the us government terminates or reduces other prime contractors programs or does not award them new contracts  subcontracting opportunities available to us could decrease  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes could result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief and damage our reputation 
we are subject to  and may become a party to  a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
for example  over time  we have had disputes with current and former employees involving alleged violations of civil rights  wage and hour  and worker s compensation laws 
further  as more fully described under item legal proceedings  six former officers and stockholders who had departed the firm prior to the acquisition have filed suits against our company and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
each of the suits arises out of the acquisition and alleges that the former stockholders are entitled to certain payments that they would have received if they had held their stock at the time of acquisition 
the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 
any claims or litigation  even if fully indemnified or insured  could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future 
the litigation and other claims described under the item legal proceedings are subject to future developments and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
systems that we develop  integrate  or maintain could experience security breaches which may damage our reputation with our clients and hinder future contract win rates 
many of the systems we develop  integrate  or maintain involve managing and protecting information involved in intelligence  national security  and other sensitive or classified government functions 
a security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business  damage our reputation  and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for us government clients 
damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work or any liability resulting from a security breach in one of the systems we develop  install  or maintain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents internal system or service failures  including as a result of cyber or other security threats  could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients  which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we create  implement  and maintain information technology and engineering systems  and provide services that are often critical to our clients operations  some of which involve classified or other sensitive information and may be conducted in war zones or other hazardous environments 
as a result  we are subject to systems or service failures  not only resulting from our own failures or the failures of third party service providers  natural disasters  power shortages  or terrorist attacks  but also from continuous exposure to cyber and other security threats  including computer viruses  attacks by computer hackers or physical break ins 
in particular  as a us government contractor  we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to classified or other sensitive information resulting from an attack by computer hackers  foreign governments  and cyber terrorists 
we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past and future attacks are likely to occur 
if successful  these types of attacks on our network or other systems or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  due to  among other things  the loss of client or proprietary data  interruptions or delays in our clients businesses  and damage to our reputation 
in addition  the failure or disruption of our systems  communications  or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our systems  services  or other applications have significant defects or errors  are successfully attacked by cyber and other security threats  suffer delivery delays  or otherwise fail to meet our clients expectations  we may lose revenue due to adverse client reaction  be required to provide additional services to a client at no charge  incur additional costs related to monitoring and increasing our cybersecurity  lose revenue due to the deployment of internal staff for remediation efforts instead of client assignments  receive negative publicity  which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients  be unable to successfully market services that are reliant on the creation and maintaining of secure information technology systems to us government  international  and commercial clients  suffer claims for substantial damages  particularly as a result of any successful network or systems breach and exfiltration of client information  or incur significant costs complying with applicable federal or state law  including laws governing protection of personal information 
in addition to any costs resulting from contract performance or required corrective action  these failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenue if they result in clients postponing subsequently scheduled work or canceling or failing to renew contracts 
our errors and omissions insurance coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or the insurer may disclaim coverage as to some types of future claims 
the successful assertion of any large claim against us could seriously harm our business 
even if not successful  these claims could result in significant legal and other costs  may be a distraction to our management  and may harm our client relationships 
in certain new business areas  we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance and may decide not to accept or solicit business in these areas 

table of contents the growth of our us and international business entails risks  including those associated with new relationships  clients  capabilities  service offerings  and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values 
we are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by expanding our relationships with existing clients  developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies  creating new capabilities to address our clients emerging needs  and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying near term developments and long term trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients 
these efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas  potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face and  with respect to potential international growth  risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions  such as compliance with foreign laws and regulations and applicable us regulation and economic  legal  and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
as we attempt to develop new relationships  clients  capabilities  and service offerings  these efforts could harm our results of operations due to  among other things  a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs and opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful 
in addition  our ability to grow our business by leveraging our operating model to efficiently and effectively deploy our people across our client base is largely dependent on our ability to maintain our collaborative culture 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain our culture for any reason  we may be unable to grow our business 
any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  with the growth of our us and international operations  we are now providing client services and undertaking business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations both domestically and internationally 
our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations  maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure  among other things  compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations 
any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our international operations are subject to special us government laws and regulations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  and regulations and procurement policies and practices  including regulations to import export control  which may expose us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
our international operations are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we have operations and deal with governmental customers in countries known to experience corruption  including certain emerging countries in the middle east 
our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees  consultants or contractors that could be in violation of various laws including the fcpa  even though these parties are not always subject to our control 
we are also subject to import export control regulations restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products  services  and technical data  including requirements regarding any applicable licensing of our employees involved in such work 
if we were to fail to comply with the fcpa or the applicable import export control regulations  we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties  including fines for our company and incarceration for responsible employees and managers  and the possible loss of export or import privileges which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents changes to our operating structure  capabilities or strategy intended to address our clients needs  respond to developments in our markets and grow our business may not be successful 
we routinely review our operating structure  capabilities and strategy to determine whether we are effectively meeting the needs of existing clients  effectively responding to developments in our markets and successfully building a platform intended to provide the foundation for the future growth of our business 
the outcome of any such review is difficult to predict and the extent of changes to our business following such a review  if any  are dependent in part upon the nature and extent of the review 
if we decide to implement changes to our operating structure  capabilities  strategy or any other aspect of our business following an internal review  those changes may materially alter various aspects of our business or our business model as an entirety and there can be no assurance that any such changes will be successful or that they will not ultimately have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we and our subsidiaries may incur debt in the future  which could substantially reduce our profitability  limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities  and reduce the value of your investment 
in connection with the acquisition and the recapitalization transaction  which refers to the december payment of a special dividend and repayment of a portion of the deferred payment obligation and the related amendments to our credit agreements  and as a result of our business activities  we have incurred a substantial amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately million of debt outstanding 
the instruments governing our indebtedness may not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt in the future or other obligations that do not constitute indebtedness  which could increase the risks described below and lead to other risks 
in addition  we may  increase the borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase  to an amount not to exceed million and  subject to certain closing conditions including pro forma compliance with financial covenants  an additional million 
the amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences  including  but not limited to our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders may be impaired  resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of our indebtedness  our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness  working capital  capital expenditures  product and service development  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  and other purposes may be impaired  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt  we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates  our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the industry may be limited  and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other firms in our industry 
our senior secured credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them 
our senior secured credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants relating to  among other things  interest coverage and leverage ratios  as well as limitations on mergers  consolidations and dissolutions  sales of assets  investments and acquisitions  indebtedness and liens  dividends  repurchase of shares of capital stock and options to purchase shares of capital stock  transactions with affiliates  sale and leaseback transactions  and restricted payments 
the revolving credit facility matures on july  the tranche a and tranche b term facilities mature on february  and august   respectively 
failure to meet these financial and operating covenants could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of 
table of contents debt  or changes in general economic conditions  which may be beyond our control 
these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders  which could harm our business and operations 
many of our contracts with the us government are classified or subject to other security restrictions  which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 
for fiscal  we derived a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts with the us government that are classified or subject to security restrictions that preclude the dissemination of certain information 
in addition  a significant number of our employees have security clearances which preclude them from providing information regarding certain of our clients and services provided to such clients to other of our employees without security clearances and investors 
because we are limited in our ability to provide information about these contracts and services  the various risks associated with these contracts or services or any dispute or claims relating to such contracts or services  you may not have important information concerning our business  which will limit your insight into a substantial portion of our business and therefore may be less able to fully evaluate the risks related to that portion of our business 
if we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed  our business may be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash flow  provide working capital  or continue our business operations 
we depend on the timely collection of our receivables to generate cash flow  provide working capital  and continue our business operations 
if the us government or any prime contractor for whom we are a subcontractor fails to pay or delays the payment of invoices for any reason  our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
the us government may delay or fail to pay invoices for a number of reasons  including lack of appropriated funds  lack of an approved budget  or as a result of audit findings by government regulatory agencies 
some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly fewer financial resources than we do  which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or that payment may be delayed 
recent efforts by the us government to revise its organizational conflict of interest rules could limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
recent efforts by the us government to reform its procurement practices have focused  among other areas  on the separation of certain types of work to facilitate objectivity and avoid or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest and the strengthening of regulations governing organizational conflicts of interest 
organizational conflicts of interest may arise from circumstances in which a contractor has impaired objectivity during performance  unfair access to non public information  or the ability to set the ground rules for another procurement for which the contractor competes 
a focus on organizational conflicts of interest issues has resulted in legislation and a proposed regulation aimed at increasing organizational conflicts of interest requirements  including  among other things  separating sellers of products and providers of advisory services in major defense acquisition programs 
in addition  we expect the us government to adopt a far rule to address organizational conflicts of interest issues that will apply to all government contractors  including us  in department of defense and other procurements 
a future far rule may also increase the restrictions in current organizational conflicts of interest regulations and rules 
to the extent that proposed and future organizational conflicts of interest laws  regulations  and rules  limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders with the us government  either because of organizational conflicts of interest issues arising from our business  or because companies with which we are affiliated  including through carlyle  or with which we otherwise conduct business  create organizational conflicts of interest issues for us  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents acquisitions could result in operating difficulties or other adverse consequences to our business 
as part of our operating strategy  we may choose to selectively pursue acquisitions 
this could pose many risks  including we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at prices we consider attractive  we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business  future acquisitions may require us to issue common stock or spend significant cash  resulting in dilution of ownership or additional debt leverage  we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company s key employees or clients  we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses  resulting in unforeseen difficulties  such as incompatible accounting  information management  or other control systems  and greater expenses than expected  acquisitions may disrupt our business or distract our management from other responsibilities  as a result of an acquisition  we may incur additional debt and we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  each of which could reduce our future reported earnings  and we may have difficulty integrating personnel from the acquired company with our people and our core values 
in connection with any acquisition that we make  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or that we inadequately assess  and we may fail to discover any failure of a target company to have fulfilled its contractual obligations to the us government or other clients 
acquired entities may not operate profitably or result in improved operating performance 
additionally  we may not realize anticipated synergies  business growth opportunities  cost savings  and other benefits we anticipate  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
risks related to our industry our us government contracts may be terminated by the government at any time and may contain other provisions permitting the government to discontinue contract performance  and if lost contracts are not replaced  our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 
us government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government clients with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
these rights and remedies allow government clients  among other things  to terminate existing contracts  with short notice  for convenience as well as for default  reduce orders under or otherwise modify contracts  for contracts subject to the truth in negotiations act  reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not complete  accurate  and current  for some contracts  i demand a refund  make a forward price adjustment  or terminate a contract for default if a contractor provided inaccurate or incomplete data during the contract negotiation process and ii reduce the contract price under certain triggering circumstances  including the revision of price lists or other documents upon which the contract award was predicated  terminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts  cancel multi year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable  
table of contents decline to exercise an option to renew a multi year contract or issue task orders in connection with id iq contracts  claim rights in solutions  systems  and technology produced by us  appropriate such work product for their continued use without continuing to contract for our services and disclose such work product to third parties  including other us government agencies and our competitors  which could harm our competitive position  prohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency due to a finding of organizational conflicts of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors  or the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor s judgment  subject the award of contracts to protest by competitors  which may require the contracting federal agency or department to suspend our performance pending the outcome of the protest and may also result in a requirement to resubmit offers for the contract or in the termination  reduction  or modification of the awarded contract  suspend or debar us from doing business with the us government  and control or prohibit the export of our services 
if a us government client were to unexpectedly terminate  cancel  or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant contracts  or suspend or debar us from doing business with the us government  our revenue and operating results would be materially harmed 
the us government may revise its procurement  contract or other practices in a manner adverse to us 
the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract laws  rules  and regulations  such as cost accounting standards  organizational conflicts of interest  and other rules governing inherently governmental functions at any time  reduce  delay  or cancel procurement programs resulting from us government efforts to improve procurement practices and efficiency  limit the creation of new government wide or agency specific multiple award contracts  face restrictions or pressure from government employees and their unions regarding the amount of services the us government may obtain from private contractors  award contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis in order to reduce expenditures  and we may not be the lowest cost provider of services  adopt new socio economic requirements  including setting aside funds to small  disadvantaged businesses  change the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements  and at its option  terminate or decline to renew our contracts 
in addition  any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenue and profit margin 
in addition  changes to the procurement system could cause delays in the procurement decision making process 
any such changes to the us government s procurement practices or the adoption of new contracting rules or practices could impair our ability to obtain new or re compete contracts and any such changes or increased associated costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents as part of its cost cutting initiative  the department of defense has issued guidance regarding changes to the procurement process that is intended to control cost growth throughout the acquisition cycle by developing a competitive strategy for each program 
because this initiative may significantly change the way the us government solicits  negotiates  and manages its contracts  it could result in an increase in competitive pressure and decreased profitability on contracts and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the us government may prefer minority owned  small and small disadvantaged businesses  therefore  we may not win contracts we bid for 
as a result of the small business administration set aside program  the us government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as minority owned  small  or small disadvantaged businesses 
as a result  we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and would be restricted to a maximum of of the work as a subcontractor on those programs 
an increase in the amount of procurements under the small business administration set aside program may impact our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor or restrict our ability to recomplete on incumbent work that is placed in the set aside program 
our contracts  performance  and administrative processes and systems are subject to audits  reviews  investigations  and cost adjustments by the us government  which could reduce our revenue  disrupt our business or otherwise materially adversely affect our results of operation 
us government agencies routinely audit  review  and investigate government contracts and government contractors administrative processes and systems 
these agencies review our performance on contracts  pricing practices  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards  including applicable government cost accounting standards 
these agencies also review our compliance with government regulations and policies  and the dcaa audits  among other areas  the adequacy of our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  earned value and accounting systems 
these internal control systems could focus on significant elements of costs  such as executive compensation 
determination of a significant internal control deficiency by a government agency could result in increased payment withholding that might materially increase our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and adversely affect our cash flow 
in particular  over time the dcaa has increased and may continue to increase the proportion of executive compensation that it deems unallowable and the size of the executive population whose compensation is disallowed  which will continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition including the requirement to carry an increased level of reserves 
any costs found to be unallowable under a contract will not be reimbursed  and any such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
moreover  if any of the administrative processes and systems are found not to comply with government imposed requirements  we may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or otherwise adversely affect our ability to compete for or perform contracts 
unfavorable us government audit  review  or investigation results could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions  and could harm our reputation and relationships with our clients and impair our ability to be awarded new contracts 
for example  if our invoicing system were found to be inadequate following an audit by the dcaa  our ability to directly invoice us government payment offices could be eliminated 
as a result  we would be required to submit each invoice to the dcaa for approval prior to payment  which could materially increase our accounts receivable days sales outstanding and adversely affect our cash flow 
in addition  proposed regulatory changes  if adopted  would require the department of defense s contracting officers to impose contractual withholdings at no less than certain minimum levels based on assessments of a contractor s business systems 
an unfavorable outcome to an audit  review  or investigation by any us government agency could materially and adversely affect our relationship with the us government 
if a government investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  withholding of payments  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or debarment from doing business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
provisions that we have recorded in our financial statements as a compliance 
table of contents reserve may not cover actual losses 
furthermore  the disallowance of any costs previously charged could directly and negatively affect our current results of operations for the relevant prior fiscal periods  and we could be required to repay any such disallowed amounts 
each of these results could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
a delay in the completion of the us government s budget process could result in a reduction in our backlog and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
on an annual basis  the us congress must approve budgets that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support 
when the us congress is unable to agree on budget priorities  and thus is unable to pass the annual budget on a timely basis  the us congress typically enacts a continuing resolution 
a continuing resolution allows government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle 
most recently  in the absence of an annual budget for the government s fiscal year  from september  through march   president obama signed six continuing resolutions passed by the us congress into law  and  after a threatened government shutdown  a spending bill providing funding for the government through the end of the government s fiscal year was enacted on april  under a continuing resolution  funding may not be available for new projects 
in addition  when government agencies operate on the basis of a continuing resolution  they may delay funding we expect to receive on contracts we are already performing 
any such delays would likely result in new business initiatives being delayed or cancelled and a reduction in our backlog  and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
in addition  a failure to complete the budget process and fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a federal government shutdown 
a shutdown may result in us incurring substantial costs without reimbursement under our contracts and the delay or cancellation of key programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
risks related to our common stock booz allen holding is a holding company with no operations of its own  and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses  including to make future dividend payments  if any 
the operations of booz allen holding are conducted almost entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans 
further  our senior secured credit agreement significantly restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us 
in addition  delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock 
on february  we paid a dividend to holders of our class a common stock  class b non voting common stock and class e special voting stock  which was funded entirely by our subsidiaries 
in addition  on may   we declared a special and regular dividend to holders of our class a common stock  class b non voting common stock and class e special voting stock  which was funded entirely by our subsidiaries 
we may declare and make future dividend payments  which obligates our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for the payment of the dividends 
our principal stockholder could exert significant influence over our company 
as of march   carlyle  through coinvest  owned shares of our common stock representing of our outstanding voting power excluding shares of common stock with respect to which carlyle has received a voting proxy pursuant to irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements 
under the terms of the irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements carlyle is able to exercise voting power over shares of our common stock owned by a number of other stockholders  including our executive officers  with respect to the election and removal of directors and change of control transactions 
as a result  carlyle will have a controlling influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval  including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions 

table of contents in addition  coinvest is a party to the amended and restated stockholders agreement pursuant to which carlyle has the right to nominate a majority of the members of our board of directors  or our board  and to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval and our policy and affairs 
in addition  we are a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules and  as a result  currently intend to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
the concentrated holdings of funds affiliated with carlyle  certain provisions of the amended and restated stockholders agreement and the presence of carlyle s nominees on our board may result in a delay or the deterrence of possible changes in control of our company  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
the interests of carlyle may not always coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies  and may from time to time in the future acquire controlling interests in businesses engaged in management and technology consulting that complement or directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business 
if carlyle pursues such acquisitions in our industry  those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
in addition  to the extent that carlyle acquires a controlling interest in one or more companies that provide services or products to the us government  our affiliation with any such company through carlyle could create organizational conflicts of interest and similar issues for us under federal procurement laws and regulations 
see risks related to our business recent efforts by the us government to revise its organizational conflicts of interest rules could limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial results may vary significantly from period to period as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside our control  which could cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate 
our financial results may vary significantly from period to period in the future as a result of many external factors that are outside of our control 
factors that may affect our financial results and that could cause the market price of our outstanding securities  including our class a common stock  to fluctuate include those listed in this risk factors section and others such as any cause of reduction or delay in us government funding  fluctuations in revenue earned on existing contracts  commencement  completion  or termination of contracts during a particular period  a potential decline in our overall profit margins if our other direct costs and subcontract revenue grow at a faster rate than labor related revenue  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as changes to business strategy  strategic investments  acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  and joint ventures  a change in our contract mix to less profitable contracts  changes in policy or budgetary measures that adversely affect us government contracts in general  variable purchasing patterns under us government gsa schedules  blanket purchase agreements  which are agreements that fulfill repetitive needs under gsa schedules  and id iq contracts  changes in demand for our services and solutions  fluctuations in the degree to which we are able to utilize our professionals  seasonality associated with the us government s fiscal year  an inability to utilize existing or future tax benefits for any reason  including a change in law  alterations to contract requirements  and adverse judgments or settlements in legal disputes 

table of contents a majority of our outstanding indebtedness is secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets 
as a result of these security interests  such assets would only be available to satisfy claims of our general creditors or to holders of our equity securities if we were to become insolvent to the extent the value of such assets exceeded the amount of our indebtedness and other obligations 
in addition  the existence of these security interests may adversely affect our financial flexibility 
indebtedness under our senior secured credit agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  if an event of default were to occur under our senior secured credit agreement  the senior secured lenders under such facilities would have a prior right to our assets  to the exclusion of our general creditors in the event of our bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  or reorganization 
in that event  our assets would first be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them including all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement  resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the claims of our unsecured indebtedness 
only after satisfying the claims of our unsecured creditors and our subsidiaries unsecured creditors would any amount be available for our equity holders 
the pledge of these assets and other restrictions may limit our flexibility in raising capital for other purposes 
because substantially all of our assets are pledged under these financing arrangements  our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired  which could have an adverse effect on our financial flexibility 
as of march   we had million of indebtedness outstanding under our senior secured credit agreement and had million of capacity available for additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit agreement 
in addition  we may  increase the borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit agreement without the consent of any person other than the institutions agreeing to provide all or any portion of such increase  to an amount not to exceed million and  subject to certain closing conditions including pro forma compliance with financial covenants  an additional million 
fulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company  including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the sarbanes oxley act of  is expensive and time consuming and any delays or difficulty in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price 
as a public company  the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec  as well as the new york stock exchange rules  require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules 
compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant management time and place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial  accounting  and information systems 
we have hired additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge 
other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing  accounting  and legal fees and expenses  investor relations expenses  increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs  registrar and transfer agent fees  listing fees  as well as other expenses 
in particular  the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with an established internal control framework  and to report on our conclusions as to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
it also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal control over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls 
in addition  we are required under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
any failure to maintain effective controls or implement new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 
this could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock 
failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the sec  the new york stock exchange  or other regulatory authorities 

table of contents provisions in our organizational documents and in the delaware general corporation law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deterring  preventing  or rendering more difficult a change in control of booz allen holding that our stockholders might consider in their best interests 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board  with staggered terms  granting to the board the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the board  limitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors if a group  as defined under section d of the exchange act  ceases to own more than of our voting common stock  granting to the board the ability to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board  a prohibition on stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders  the establishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board at stockholder meetings  requiring approval of two thirds of stockholders to amend the bylaws  and prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent if a group ceases to own more than of our voting common stock 
these provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context 
even in the absence of a takeover attempt  the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
in addition  we have opted out of section of the delaware general corporation law  which would have otherwise imposed additional requirements regarding mergers and other business combinations  until carlyle and its affiliates no longer own more than of our class a common stock 
after such time  we will be governed by section our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management 
these provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay  deter  render more difficult  or prevent a change in our control  which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders 
sales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly 
as of march   carlyle owned  shares of our class a common stock  or of our outstanding class a common stock excluding shares of common stock with respect to which carlyle has received a voting proxy pursuant to irrevocable proxy and tag along agreements 
if carlyle sells  or the market perceives that carlyle intends to sell  a substantial portion of its beneficial ownership interest in us in the public market  the market price of our class a common stock could decline significantly 
the sales also could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of march   shares of our class a common stock were outstanding 
in addition to the shares owned by carlyle   shares of our class a common stock which are held by directors  executive officers and other affiliates  are restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act eligible for resale in the public market subject to volume  manner of sale and holding period limitations under rule under the securities act 
 shares of our class a common stock are issuable upon transfer of our class b non voting common stock and class c restricted common stock 
in addition  
table of contents  shares of our class a common stock are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options granted under our officers rollover stock plan relating to our outstanding class e special voting common stock and  shares of our class a common stock underlying options that are either subject to the terms of our equity incentive plan or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various option agreements and  to the extent held by affiliates  the volume and manner of sale restrictions of rule if these additional shares are sold  or if it is perceived that they will be sold  in the public market  the price of our class a common stock could decline substantially

item legal proceedings 
our performance under us government contracts and compliance with the terms of those contracts and applicable laws and regulations are subject to continuous audit  review  and investigation by the us government which may include such investigative techniques as subpoenas or civil investigative demands 
given the nature of our business  these audits  reviews  and investigations may focus  among other areas  on various aspects of procurement integrity  labor time reporting  sensitive and or classified information access and control  executive compensation  and post government employment restrictions 
we are not always aware of our status in such matters  but we are currently aware of certain pending audits and investigations involving labor time reporting  procurement integrity  and classified information access 
on april   we entered into an administrative agreement with the us air force  which lifted the proposed debarment of our san antonio office and removed it from the us government s excluded parties list system 
see item business regulation for additional information 
in addition  from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings and investigations arising in the ordinary course of business  including those relating to employment matters  relationships with clients and contractors  intellectual property disputes  and other business matters 
these legal proceedings seek various remedies  including claims for monetary damages in varying amounts that currently range up to million or have a reasonably estimated outcome within that range or are unspecified as to amount 
although the outcome of any such matter is inherently uncertain and may be materially adverse  based on current information  we do not expect any of the currently ongoing audits  reviews  investigations  or litigation to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of march  and  there are no amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements related to these proceedings 
six former officers and stockholders who had departed the firm prior to the acquisition have filed a total of nine suits in various jurisdictions  with original filing dates ranging from july  through december  three of which were amended on july  and then further amended into one consolidated complaint on september   against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
each of the suits arises out of the acquisition and alleges that the former stockholders are entitled to certain payments that they would have received if they had held their stock at the time of the acquisition 
some of the suits also allege that 
table of contents the acquisition price paid to stockholders was insufficient 
the various suits assert claims for breach of contract  tortious interference with contract  breach of fiduciary duty  civil racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  or rico  violations  violations of the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  and or securities and common law fraud 
two of these suits have been dismissed with all appeals exhausted 
five of the remaining suits are pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  the sixth is pending in new york state court  and the seventh is pending in the united states district court for the southern district of california 
the aggregate alleged damages sought in these seven remaining suits is approximately million million of which is sought to be trebled pursuant to rico  plus punitive damages  costs  and fees 
although the outcome of any of these cases is inherently uncertain and may be materially adverse  based on current information  we do not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents financial and other highlights revenue grew from fiscal to fiscal while revenue generated by our direct consulting staff labor grew over the same period 
direct consulting staff labor represents our consulting staff s labor under contracts for which we act as the prime contractor or subcontractor 
total backlog decreased by to billion from fiscal to fiscal substantially all of our revenue and backlog is derived from services and solutions provided to client organizations across the us government  primarily by our consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
the mix of revenue generated by consulting staff and subcontractors affects our operating margin  substantially all of which is derived from direct consulting staff labor  as the portion of our operating margin derived from fees we earn on services provided by our subcontractors is not significant 
the fiscal revenue growth occurred across all served markets with the highest growth in areas relating to finance and health consulting services for civil government agencies and classified services to the us intelligence community 
operating income grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which reflects a basis point increase in operating margin to from in the comparable periods 
the improvement in operating margin was driven by the continued growth in revenue and increased profitability resulting from decreases in incentive and stock based compensation costs and lower amortization of our intangible assets 
the factors contributing to the increased operating margin were partially offset by increases in business development costs including marketing and bid and proposal activity as well as additional administrative costs associated with delays in deploying certain direct consulting staff labor against funded backlog 
in addition  in fiscal the company recognized approximately million net of revenue of charges associated with a restructuring plan to reduce certain personnel and infrastructure costs 
cash provided by operations increased million to million from million 
the increase in cash provided by operations was a result of overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from clients in a timely manner  and our effective management of vendor payments 
our tax payments increased by approximately million during fiscal principally due to the utilization of our entire federal and the majority of our state net operating loss  or nol  carryforward 
in the current year  approximately million of stock options were exercised resulting in a cash tax benefit of approximately million 
the company reviewed its federal and state tax elections as part of its overall cash tax planning strategy and determined to make a significant prepayment of fiscal income taxes in the amount of million 
the company anticipates utilizing this prepayment as an offset to its fiscal cash taxes to be paid 
as a result of the refinancing of our credit facilities in february  which resulted in a reduction of our outstanding debt at lower interest rates  we realized a reduction in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal of million 
non gaap measures we publically disclose certain non gaap financial measurements  including adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted earnings per share  or eps  because management uses these measures for business planning purposes  including to manage our business against internal projected results of operations and measure our performance 
we view adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted eps as measures of our core operating business  which exclude the impact of the items detailed below  as these items are generally not operational in nature 
these non gaap measures also provide another basis for comparing period to period results by excluding potential differences caused by non operational and unusual or non recurring items 
we also utilize and discuss free cash flow  because management uses this measure for business planning purposes  measuring the cash generating ability of the operating business  and measuring liquidity generally 
we present these supplemental measures because we believe that these measures provide investors with important supplemental information with which to evaluate our performance  long term earnings potential  or liquidity  as applicable  and to enable them to assess our performance on the same basis as management 
these supplemental performance 
table of contents measurements may vary from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry 
adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  adjusted diluted eps  and free cash flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  and when analyzing our performance or liquidity  as applicable  investors should i evaluate each adjustment in our reconciliation of operating and net income to adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income  and cash flows to free cash flows  and the explanatory footnotes regarding those adjustments  each as defined under gaap  ii use adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and adjusted diluted eps in addition to  and not as an alternative to  operating income  net income or diluted eps  as a measure of operating results  and iii use free cash flows in addition to  and not as an alternative to  net cash generated from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  each as defined under gaap 
we have defined the aforementioned non gaap measures as follows adjusted operating income represents operating income before i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii adjustments related to the amortization of intangible assets  and iii any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items 
we prepare adjusted operating income to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted ebitda represents net income before income taxes  net interest and other expense  and depreciation and amortization and before certain other items  including i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii transaction costs  fees  losses  and expenses  including fees associated with debt prepayments  and iii any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items 
we prepare adjusted ebitda to eliminate the impact of items we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted net income represents net income before i certain stock option based and other equity based compensation expenses  ii transaction costs  fees  losses  and expenses  including fees associated with debt prepayments  iii adjustments related to the amortization of intangible assets  iv amortization or write off of debt issuance costs and write off of original issue discount  and v any extraordinary  unusual  or non recurring items  in each case net of the tax effect calculated using an assumed effective tax rate 
we prepare adjusted net income to eliminate the impact of items  net of tax  we do not consider indicative of ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual  extraordinary  or non recurring nature or because they result from an event of a similar nature 
adjusted diluted eps represents diluted eps calculated using adjusted net income as opposed to net income 
free cash flow represents the net cash generated from operating activities less the impact of purchases of property and equipment

recent developments on may   our board of directors authorized and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share 
in addition  the board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share 
both the quarterly and special dividend are payable on june  to shareholders of record on june  the compensation committee  as the administrator of the officers rollover stock plan and the amended and restated equity incentive plan  made a determination to adjust the outstanding options under each plan by reducing the exercise price of the rollover options by the amount of the special dividend and by granting the holders of eip options a dividend equivalent equal to the special dividend and payable on june  or the vesting of the eip option  whichever is later 
we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  however  the actual declaration of any such future dividends and the establishment of the per share amount  record dates  and payment dates for any such future dividends are subject to the discretion of the board of directors taking into account future earnings  cash flows  financial requirements  and other factors 
on may   our board of directors also authorized the payment of the accrued interest on the dpo as of july  we expect approximately million will be paid on that date 
factors and trends affecting our results of operations our results of operations have been  and we expect them to continue to be  affected by the following factors  which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results of operations discussed under results of operations 
business environment and key trends in our markets we believe that the following trends and developments in the us government services industry and our markets may influence our future results of operations budget deficits and the growing us national debt increasing pressure on the us government to reduce federal spending across all federal agencies together with associated uncertainty about the size and timing of those reductions  
table of contents changes in the relative mix of overall us government spending and areas of spending growth  with lower spending on homeland security  intelligence and defense related programs as overseas operations end  and continued increased spending on cyber security  advanced analytics  technology integration and healthcare  cost cutting and efficiency initiatives and other efforts to streamline the us defense and intelligence infrastructure  including the initiatives implemented by the secretary of defense or reductions in defense budgets resulting from congressional action or automatic sequestration as required under the budget control act of  delays in the completion of the us government s budget process  which has in the past and could in the future delay procurement of the products  services  and solutions we provide  existing and proposed fiscal constraints by the us government and uncertainty about the size of future budget reductions may cause clients to invest appropriated funds on a less consistent or rapid basis  or not at all  particularly when considering long term initiatives  not issue task orders in sufficient volume to reach current contract ceilings  and delay requests for new proposals and contract awards  relying on short term extensions of current contracts instead  the federal focus on refining the definition of inherently governmental work will continue to drive pockets of insourcing in various agencies  particularly in the intelligence market  cost cutting and efficiency and effectiveness efforts by the us civilian agencies with a focus on increased use of performance measurement  program integrity efforts to reduce waste  fraud and abuse in entitlement programs  and renewed focus on improving procurement practices for and interagency use of it services  including through the use of cloud based options and data center consolidation  us government agencies awarding contracts on a technically acceptable lowest cost basis  which could have a negative impact on our ability to win certain contracts  restrictions by the us government on the ability of federal agencies to use lead system integrators  in response to cost  schedule and performance problems with large defense acquisition programs where contractors were performing the lead system integrator role  increasingly complex requirements of the department of defense and the us intelligence community  including cyber security  managing federal health care cost growth and focus on reforming existing government regulation of various sectors of the economy  such as financial regulation and healthcare  increased competition from other government contractors and market entrants seeking to take advantage of the trends identified above  and efforts by the us government to address organizational conflicts of interest and related issues and the impact of those efforts on us and our competitors 
sources of revenue substantially all of our revenue is derived from services provided under contracts and task orders with the us government  primarily by our consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  our subcontractors 
funding for our contracts and task orders is generally linked to trends in budgets and spending across various us government agencies and departments 
we provide services under a large portfolio of contracts and contract vehicles to a broad client base  and we believe that our diversified contract and client base lessens potential volatility in our business 
we have historically grown and continued through fiscal to grow  our revenue organically without relying on acquisitions 

table of contents contract types we generate revenue under the following three basic types of contracts cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract  up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded  plus a fee 
we generate revenue under two general types of cost reimbursable contracts cost plus fixed fee and cost plus award fee  both of which reimburse allowable costs and provide for a fee 
the fee under each type of cost reimbursable contract is generally payable upon completion of services in accordance with the terms of the contract 
cost plus fixed fee contracts offer no opportunity for payment beyond the fixed fee 
cost plus award fee contracts also provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based upon the client s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria  such as targets for factors like cost  quality  schedule  and performance 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended  and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component  pursuant to which we can earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
fixed price level of effort contracts require us to provide a specified level of effort ie  labor hours  over a stated period of time  for a fixed price 
the amount of risk and potential reward varies under each type of contract 
under cost reimbursable contracts  there is limited financial risk  because we are reimbursed for all allowable costs up to a ceiling 
however  profit margins on this type of contract tend to be lower than on time and materials and fixed price contracts 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for the hours worked using the predetermined hourly rates for each labor category 
in addition  we are typically reimbursed for other contract direct costs and expenses at cost 
we assume financial risk on time and materials contracts because our labor costs may exceed the negotiated billing rates 
profit margins on well managed time and materials contracts tend to be higher than profit margins on cost reimbursable contracts as long as we are able to staff those contracts with people who have an appropriate skill set 
under fixed price contracts  we are required to deliver the objectives under the contract for a pre determined price 
compared to time and materials and cost reimbursable contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities because we receive the full benefit of any cost savings but generally involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns 
in the aggregate  the contract type mix in our revenue for any given period will affect that period s profitability 
over time we have experienced a relatively stable contract mix 
the table below presents the percentage of total revenue for each type of contract fiscal year ended march  cost reimbursable time and materials fixed price includes both cost plus fixed fee and cost plus award fee contracts 
includes fixed price level of effort contracts 

table of contents contract diversity and revenue mix we provide services to our clients through a large number of single award contracts and contract vehicles and multiple award contract vehicles 
in fiscal  the revenue from our top ten single award contracts or contract vehicles based on revenue represented of our revenue 
most of our revenue is generated under id iq contract vehicles  which include multiple award gwacs and gsa schedules and certain single award contracts 
gwacs and gsa schedules are available to all us government agencies 
any number of contractors typically compete under multiple award id iq contract vehicles for task orders to provide particular services  and we earn revenue under these contract vehicles only to the extent that we are successful in the bidding process for task orders 
in fiscal   and  our revenue under gwacs and gsa schedules collectively represented   and of our total revenue  respectively 
no single task order under any contract represented more than of our revenue in fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal no single contract accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal we generate revenue under our contracts and task orders through our provision of services as both a prime contractor and subcontractor  as well as from the provision of services by subcontractors under contracts and task orders for which we act as the prime contractor 
for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal    and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by contracts and task orders for which we served as a prime contractor    and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by contracts and task orders for which we served as a subcontractor  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was generated by services provided by our subcontractors 
the mix of these types of revenue affects our operating margin 
substantially all of our operating margin is derived from direct consulting staff labor and the portion of our operating margin derived from fees we earn on services provided by our subcontractors is not significant 
we view growth in direct consulting staff labor as the primary measure of earnings growth 
direct consulting staff labor growth is driven by consulting staff headcount growth  after attrition  and total backlog growth 
our people revenue from our contracts is derived from services delivered by consulting staff and  to a lesser extent  from our subcontractors 
our ability to hire  retain  and deploy talent with skills appropriately aligned with client needs is critical to our ability to grow our revenue 
we continuously evaluate whether our talent base is properly sized and contains an optimal mix of skills to meet the rapidly evolving needs of our clients and we seek to achieve that result through recruitment and capacity management 
as of march  and we employed approximately  people and as of march  we employed approximately  people  of which approximately   and  respectively were consulting staff 
attrition for consulting staff was   and in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  approximately of the attrition was due to the company s restructuring that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal contract backlog we define backlog to include the following three components funded backlog 
funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts 
unfunded backlog 
unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
priced options 
priced contract options represent of the revenue value of all future contract option periods under existing contracts that may be exercised at our clients option and for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized 
backlog does not include any task orders under id iq contracts  including gwacs and gsa schedules  except to the extent that task orders have been awarded to us under those contracts 

table of contents the following table summarizes the value of our contract backlog at the respective dates presented as of march  in millions backlog funded unfunded priced options total backlog reflects a reduction by management to the revenue value of orders for services under two existing single award id iq contracts based on an established pattern of funding under these contracts by the us government 
amounts shown reflect of the undiscounted revenue value of all priced options 
our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years 
the us congress generally appropriates funds for our clients on a yearly basis  even though their contracts with us may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years 
as a result  contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the us congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract 
we view growth in total backlog and consulting staff headcount as the two key measures of our potential business growth 
growing and deploying consulting staff is the primary means by which we are able to recognize profitable revenue growth 
to the extent that we are able to hire additional consulting staff and deploy them against funded backlog  we generally recognize increased revenue 
total backlog decreased by from march  to march  and grew from march  to march  additions to funded backlog during fiscal and totaled billion and billion  respectively  as a result of the conversion of unfunded backlog to funded backlog  the award of new contracts and task orders under which funding was appropriated  and the exercise and subsequent funding of priced options 
we report internally on our backlog on a monthly basis and review backlog upon occurrence of certain events to determine if any adjustments are necessary 
we cannot predict with any certainty the portion of our backlog that we expect to recognize as revenue in any future period and we cannot guarantee that we will recognize any revenue from our backlog 
the primary risks that could affect our ability to recognize such revenue on a timely basis or at all are program schedule changes  contract modifications  and our ability to assimilate and deploy new consulting staff against funded backlog  cost cutting initiatives and other efforts to reduce us government spending  which could reduce or delay funding for orders for services  and delayed funding of our contracts due to delays in the completion of the us government s budgeting process and the use of continuing resolutions by the us government to fund its operations 
funded backlog includes orders under contracts for which the period of performance has expired  and we may not recognize revenue on the funded backlog that includes such orders due to  among other reasons  the tardy submission of invoices by our subcontractors and the expiration of the relevant appropriated funding in accordance with a pre determined expiration date such as the end of the us government s fiscal year 
the revenue value of orders included in funded backlog that has not been recognized as revenue due to period of performance expirations has not exceeded approximately of funded backlog as of the end of any of the eight fiscal quarters preceding the fiscal quarter ended march  in our recent experience  none of the following additional risks have had a material negative effect on our ability to realize revenue from our funded backlog the unilateral right of the us government to cancel multi year contracts and related orders or to terminate existing contracts for convenience or default  in the case of unfunded backlog  the potential that funding will not be made available  and  in the case of priced options  the risk that our clients will not exercise their options 

table of contents operating costs and expenses costs associated with compensation and related expenses for our people are the most significant component of our operating costs and expenses 
the principal factors that affect our costs are additional people as we grow our business and are awarded new contracts  task orders  and additional work under our existing contracts  and the hiring of people with specific skill sets and security clearances as required by our additional work 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  our board of directors adopted a new equity compensation plan 
the equity compensation component of the new plan has reduced officer related compensation expense included in cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses over the near term with such expense reduction to reverse over time 
our most significant operating costs and expenses are described below 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes direct labor  related employee benefits  and overhead 
overhead consists of indirect costs  including indirect labor relating to infrastructure  management and administration  and other expenses 
billable expenses 
billable expenses include direct subcontractor expenses  travel expenses  and other expenses incurred to perform on contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include indirect labor of executive management and corporate administrative functions  marketing and bid and proposal costs  and other discretionary spending 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of computers  leasehold improvements  furniture and other equipment  and the amortization of internally developed software  as well as third party software that we use internally  and of identifiable long lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
seasonality the us government s fiscal year ends on september of each year 
it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds 
in addition  we also have generally experienced higher bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the us government s fiscal year end as we pursue new contract opportunities being awarded shortly after the us government fiscal year end as new opportunities are expected to have funding appropriated in the us government s subsequent fiscal year 
we may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods  and our future periods may be affected by it 
seasonality is just one of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  which may affect our results in any period 
see item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current reasonably available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies and practices listed below  are more fully described and discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following 
table of contents accounting policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of our management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and are the most important to our financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition and cost estimation substantially all of our revenue is derived from contracts to provide professional services to the us government and its agencies 
in most cases  we recognize revenue as work is performed 
we recognize revenue for cost plus fixed fee contracts with the us government as hours are worked based on reimbursable and allowable costs  recoverable indirect costs and an accrual for the fixed fee component of these contracts 
many of our us government contracts include award fees  which are earned based on the client s evaluation of our performance 
we have significant history with the client for the majority of contracts on which we earn award fees 
that history and management monitoring of performance form the basis for our ability to estimate such fees over the life of the contract 
based on these estimates  we recognize award fees as work on the contracts is performed 
revisions to these estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  and are reflected in the financial statements in periods in which they are identified 
revenue earned under time and materials contracts is recognized as hours are worked based on contractually billable rates to the client 
costs on time and materials contracts are expensed as incurred 
for fixed price contracts  we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion basis with progress toward completion of a particular contract based on actual costs incurred relative to total estimated costs to be incurred over the life of the contract 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs under the contract can be made 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are regularly reviewed and recorded revenue and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  and are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
estimating costs under our long term contracts is complex and involves significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in making estimates include labor productivity and availability  the nature and technical complexity of the work to be performed  potential performance delays  warranty obligations  availability and timing of funding from the client  progress toward completion  and recoverability of claims 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses and additional information becomes known  even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change 
any adjustment as a result of a change in estimates is made when facts develop  events become known  or an adjustment is otherwise warranted  such as in the case of a contract modification 
we have procedures and processes in place to monitor the actual progress of a project against estimates and our estimates are updated if circumstances are warranted 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
as the consolidated entity represents the only component that constitutes a business whereby discrete financial information is available  we concluded that we have one reporting unit  which is the same as our single operating segment 
we test the trade name for impairment using the royalty relief method 
we perform our annual testing for impairment of goodwill and the trade name as of january of each year 
we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill and the trade name as of january  and on december   we adopted new goodwill impairment guidance whereby we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of equity 
in making this assessment we considered all relevant events and circumstances 
these include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  and the reporting unit s 
table of contents overall financial performance 
based on our qualitative assessment at january   we believe that it was not likely ie  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than the carrying amount 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we did not record any goodwill impairment or any impairment of our trade name 
further  we do not consider any of the goodwill or trade name at risk of impairment 
share based payments we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value for stock options 
critical inputs into the black scholes option pricing model include the following option exercise price  fair value of the stock price  expected life of the option  annualized volatility of the stock  annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock  and risk free interest rate 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized and declared a cash dividend in the amount of per share to holders of booz allen holding s class a common stock  class b non voting common stock and class c restricted common stock 
therefore  an annualized dividend yield of approximately was used in the black scholes option pricing model for all grants issued after february  prior to this  the company did not issue recurring dividends and a dividend yield of zero was used in the black scholes option pricing model 
implied volatility is calculated as of each grant date based on our historical volatility along with an assessment of a peer group for future option grants 
other than the expected life of the option  volatility is the most sensitive input to our option grants 
to be consistent with all other implied calculations  the same peer group used to calculate other implied metrics is also used to calculate implied volatility 
while we are not aware of any news or disclosures by our peers that may impact their respective volatility  there is a risk that peer group volatility may increase  potentially increasing any prospective future compensation expense that will result from future option grants 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is determined by referencing the us treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical analysis of attrition levels 
forfeiture estimates will be updated quarterly for actual forfeitures 
we do not expect this assumption to change materially  as attrition levels associated with new option grants have not materially changed 
as our class a common stock was not publicly traded until november   we previously obtained contemporaneous valuations by an independent valuation specialist for our fair value determinations 
the valuations were based on several generally accepted valuation techniques a discounted cash flow analysis  a comparable public company analysis  and for the most recent valuation  a comparative transaction analysis 
estimates used in connection with the discounted cash flow analysis were consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the business although there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
the valuation analysis resulted in a range of derived values with the final value selected and approved by our compensation committee 
the completion of the initial public offering has added value to the shares due to  among other things  increased liquidity and marketability  however  the extent if any of such additional value cannot be measured with precision or certainty and the shares could suffer a decrease in value 
as a public company  we now use the closing price of our class a common stock on the grant date for valuation purposes 
accounting for income taxes provisions for federal and state income taxes are calculated from the income reported on our financial statements based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those 
table of contents previously used in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for purposes of preparing financial statements than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when  despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable  there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our previously filed income tax returns 
for tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the value of the deferred tax assets is not realizable 
recent accounting pronouncements during the fiscal year ended march   the company adopted the following accounting pronouncements  none of which had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  presentation of comprehensive income  which amends the presentation options in accounting standards codification topic  comprehensive income 
this guidance requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the guidance does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured  or when they must be reclassified to net income 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
as this guidance impacts presentation only  it will have no effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company elected early adoption effective june  using the two statement approach 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  testing goodwill for impairment  which amends topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company elected early adoption effective as of our measurement date  january  based on our qualitative assessment at january   we believe that it was not likely ie  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than the carrying amount 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board during fiscal and through the filing date did not and are not believed by management to have a material impact on the company s present or future consolidated financial statements 
segment reporting we report operating results and financial data in one operating and reportable segment 
we manage our business as a single profit center in order to promote collaboration  provide comprehensive functional service 
table of contents offerings across our entire client base  and provide incentives to employees based on the success of the organization as a whole 
although certain information regarding served markets and functional capabilities is discussed for purposes of promoting an understanding of our complex business  we manage our business and allocate resources at the consolidated level of a single operating segment 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries  and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company s fiscal year ends on march and unless otherwise noted  references to fiscal year or fiscal are for fiscal years ended march the accompanying consolidated financial statements present the financial position of the company as of march  and and the company s results of operations for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
results of operations the following table sets forth items from our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash to fund our operations  debt payments  capital expenditures  and discretionary funding needs 
we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of march  and  respectively 
however  due to fluctuations in cash flows and the growth in operations  it may be necessary from time to time in the future to borrow under our senior secured loan facilities to meet cash demands 
we anticipate that cash provided by operating activities  existing cash and cash equivalents  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  which primarily include operating expenses  including salaries  working capital requirements to fund the growth of our business  capital expenditures which primarily relate to the purchase of computers  business systems  furniture and leasehold improvements to support our operations  debt service requirements for borrowings under our senior secured loan facilities  and cash taxes to be paid

from time to time we evaluate alternative uses for excess cash resources including debt prepayments  payment of dividends  share repurchases or funding acquisitions 
any determination to pursue one or more of the 
table of contents above alternative uses for excess cash is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and will depend upon various factors  including our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity requirements  restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law  our contracts  and our senior secured credit agreement  as amended  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
on december   our board of directors approved a million share repurchase program  to be funded from cash on hand 
a special committee of the board of directors was appointed to evaluate market conditions and other relevant factors and initiate repurchases under the program from time to time 
the share repurchase program may be suspended  modified or discontinued at any time at the company s discretion without prior notice 
as of march   no shares have been repurchased under the program

cash flows cash received from clients  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the client 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including whether the contract type is cost reimbursable  time and materials  or fixed price 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
in contrast  we may be limited to bill certain fixed price contracts only when specified milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
we experienced a slight shift to fixed price contracts year over year resulting in no material impact to operating cash flow 
in addition  a number of our contracts may provide for performance based payments  which allow us to bill and collect cash prior to completing the work 
accounts receivable is the principal component of our working capital and is generally driven by revenue growth with other short term fluctuations related to the payment practices of our clients 
our accounts receivable reflect amounts billed to our clients as of each balance sheet date

at any month end  we also include in accounts receivable the revenue that was recognized in the preceding month  which is generally billed early in the following month 
finally  we include in accounts receivable amounts related to revenue accrued in excess of amounts billed  primarily on our fixed price and cost plus award fee contracts 
the total amount of our accounts receivable can vary significantly over time  but is generally sensitive to revenue levels 
total accounts receivable billed and unbilled combined  net of allowance for doubtful accounts days sales outstanding  which we calculate by dividing total accounts receivable by revenue per day during the relevant fiscal quarter  was and as of march  and  respectively

capital expenditures also decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal were higher due to the additional facility expansion and computer equipment to support the increase in headcount 
we expect capital expenditures in future years to be more comparable to historical levels 
net cash from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year period  or a decrease 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of debt in fiscal  offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to our initial public offering in fiscal indebtedness on february   we completed the refinancing of our credit facilities  or the refinancing transaction  which included amendments of the senior secured credit agreement to amend the term loan facilities and increase our revolving credit facility 
the senior secured credit agreement  as amended  provides for billion in term loans million of tranche a loans and million of tranche b loans and a million revolving credit facility

subject to a leveraged based pricing grid  the applicable margins on tranche a loans range from to with respect to eurocurrency loans  or to with respect to abr loans 
the applicable margins on tranche b loans are with respect to eurocurrency loans  or with respect to the abr loans  stepping down  in each case to and  respectively  when the total leverage ratio is less than or equal to to 
the revolving credit facility margin and commitment fee are subject to the leveraged based pricing grid  as set forth in the senior secured credit agreement  as amended 
as of march   we were contingently liable under open standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued by our banks in favor of third parties that total million 
these letters of credit and bank guarantees primarily relate to leases and support of insurance obligations 
these instruments reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of march   we had million of capacity available for additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility

off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations that require us to make future cash payments as of march  for contractual obligations  we included payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make 
payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt a operating lease obligations interest on indebtedness deferred payment obligation b liability to rollover option holders c tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions d other total contractual obligations a see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding debt and related matters

d includes million of tax liabilities offset by amounts owed under the deferred payment obligation 
the remainder is related to other tax liabilities 
in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors and vendors to provide products and services that we consume in our operations or that are delivered to our clients 
these products and services are not considered unconditional obligations until the products and services are actually delivered  at which time we record a liability for our obligation 
capital expenditures since we do not own any of our facilities  our capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to the purchase of computers  business systems  furniture  and leasehold improvements to support our operations 
direct costs billed to clients are not treated as capital expenses 
our capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively  and the majority of such capital expenditures related to facilities infrastructure  equipment and information technology

a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash equivalents  which consist primarily of funds invested in us government insured money market accounts and prime money market funds 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
the interest expense associated with our term loans and any loans under our revolving credit facility will vary with market rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt will impact our senior secured loan facilities 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense related to the term facilities under our senior secured loan facilities by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and likewise decreased our income and cash flows 
a hypothetical increase of libor to  the average historical three month libor  would have increased interest expense related to all term facilities under our senior secured loan facilities by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and likewise decreased our income and cash flows 
the year over year variance in interest expense is driven by lower interest rate spreads and floors related to the debt facility refinance in february the return on our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march  and was less than 
therefore  although investment interest rates may continue to decrease in the future  the corresponding impact to our interest income  and likewise to our income and cash flow  would not be material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have not entered into any hedging transactions
