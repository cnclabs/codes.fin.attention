table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs with a specific focus on the us market 
through strategic alliances primarily with japanese pharmaceutical companies  we hold rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates which we believe provide significant commercial opportunity for the company 
we were incorporated in delaware in september we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  including approximately million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee stock based compensation and founders warrants 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development programs  primarily mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations  and over the long term if we are successful in expanding our research and development programs and acquiring or in licensing products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
while there can be no assurances  we believe our working capital at december  to be sufficient to fund our operating requirements for at least through december  we have acquired licenses to eight compounds for the development of ten product candidates  which include clinical development for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  ms  bronchial asthma  ic  solid tumor cancers  generalized anxiety disorders insomnia  preterm labor and urinary incontinence 
two of such compounds have been in preclinical development for the treatment of thrombotic disorders 
in addition  we have expanded our development program for mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture company with zhejiang medicine co  ltd 
and beijing make friend medicine technology co  ltd 
effective september  the joint venture agreement provides for the joint venture company to develop and commercialize mn in china 
a sublicense under which the joint venture company will license mn from us will be required  which sublicense will require the consent of kissei 
in accordance with the joint venture agreement  on march   we paid  for our interest in the joint venture company 
the other parties to the joint venture agreement are responsible for providing their initial funding in the joint venture company for their combined interest  and for future funding for the joint venture company s activities which will include managing and operating a facility to manufacture drug candidates for the chinese market  promoting  distributing and selling drug candidates in the chinese market and conducting clinical trials necessary to gain regulatory approval in china 
the joint venture company will initially conduct these activities with respect to mn  however other drug candidates may be brought within the scope of the joint venture company if the parties to the agreement unanimously agree 
we have not entered into the sublicense of mn with the joint venture company as of the date of this report 
there is no assurance the sublicense will be executed and there is no assurance that the joint venture company will be able to proceed with the development of mn in china 
at december   we reflect a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheet which represents our investment and a corresponding current liability which represents our required capital contribution payable to the joint venture company 
we evaluated the joint 
table of contents venture company under the authoritative guidance and concluded that it is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary as we will not have a majority of the board seats and we will not have any power to direct or significantly influence the actions of the entity 
we will therefore not consolidate the joint venture company into our financial results but will account for the activities of the joint venture company under the equity method whereby we will absorb any loss or income generated by the entity according to our percentage ownership 
at present  we are focusing our resources on the following prioritized product development programs mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations  for which we initiated a phase clinical trial mn cl in the first quarter of to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mn in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma treated in the emergency room 
this trial completed enrollment in march depending on the results of our phase clinical trial mn cl and our ability to raise additional capital and or to enter into a collaboration with a leading pharmaceutical or biotech company  we intend to define a phase trial and other development plans for mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and conduct one or more phase trials 
copd development  which included a phase b clinical trial in patients with stable  moderate to severe copd  was completed in in the first quarter of we initiated an additional phase b a copd clinical trial that has commenced enrollment and has an anticipated trial completion around the end of the second quarter of mn  an ibudilast based product development  for which we continue to pursue discussions with potential partners or other strategic collaboration s 
mn has completed a phase clinical trial in ms in eastern europe in wherein positive safety and neuroprotective efficacy indicators were obtained  thus  directing next stage development towards a phase b progressive ms indication 
limited animal safety and product manufacturing and stability work has been completed or is ongoing 
in the drug addiction area  a phase b a opioid withdrawal clinical trial funded by the national institute on drug abuse  or nida  was completed at the end of a phase b nida funded clinical trial in methamphetamine dependent volunteers with expert investigators at ucla initiated in the fourth quarter of and is currently enrolling patients 
in addition  a headache and pain specialist in australia initiated an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial of ibudilast as a potential new pharmacotherapy for medication overuse headache that is expected to complete enrollment at the end of we intend to enter into additional strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical or biotech companies to support further clinical development of mn upon completion of proof of concept phase clinical trials  we intend to enter into strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical or biotech companies to support further clinical development  and to keep certain commercialization rights in select markets 
depending on the outcome of the phase trial of mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  we may seek to raise addition capital and or enter into a collaboration and conduct a phase development program 
we may also pursue potential partners and potential acquirers of license rights to our programs in markets outside the us in addition  we continue to limit activities for the balance of our existing product development programs in order to focus on our prioritized product development programs 
for each of these remaining product development programs  we plan to conduct development activities only to the extent deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize its value while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such programs 
our eight non prioritized product development programs consist of the following mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  for which we initiated a phase clinical program in the fourth quarter of that we subsequently terminated in the second quarter of  and for which we developed prototypes of once per day oral dosing formulations  
table of contents mn for the treatment of interstitial cystitis  for which we completed a phase clinical trial in the first quarter of  mn for the treatment of solid tumors  for which we completed one phase clinical trial in the second quarter of and one phase clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder insomnia  for which we completed a phase clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the second quarter of and a phase clinical trial for the treatment of insomnia in the fourth quarter of mn for the treatment of preterm labor  for which we completed a phase clinical trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of mn in healthy pregnant women not in labor in the second quarter of mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence  for which we completed a phase clinical trial in the fourth quarter of and a phase food effects study in the first quarter of  mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development  and mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development 
avigen transaction on december   we acquired avigen a biopharmaceutical company that focused on identifying and developing differentiated products to treat patients with serious disorders  whose potential product candidate is a microphage migration inhibitor and a glial attenuator for central nervous system  or cns  disorders such as neuropathic pain  and opioid addiction and withdrawal and methamphetamine addiction 
we continue to pursue discussions with potential partners to secure a strategic collaboration to advance clinical development of the combined development programs 
absolute merger  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  merged with and into avigen 
under the terms of the merger  we issued approximately million in secured convertible notes that matured on june   the month anniversary of the closing of the merger 
holders of these convertible notes could convert their notes into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share through may  at the maturity of the convertible notes  the remaining holders would be paid the same per share amount as the avigen shareholders that elected to receive cash at the merger closing plus accrued interest  approximately per share 
as part of the merger consideration  the former avigen shareholders were also entitled to receive approximately per share  which was paid in two increments in  and rights under contingent payment rights  or cpr  issued as part of the merger consideration 
in march we paid per share to former avigen shareholders related to the management transition plan cpr 
all additional cpr expired on august  and no payments were made related to these cpr 
our consolidated financial statements include avigen s operations following the completion of the avigen merger 
we accounted for the avigen merger using the acquisition method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded million of ipr d related to avigen s product candidate asset and million of goodwill related to the excess purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired 
the goodwill was primarily a result of the conversion feature related to the convertible notes issued pursuant to the merger agreement 
our annual test date for ipr d and goodwill impairment is december during the year ended december  and through the date of this report  there were no triggering events  market conditions or other factors such as adverse clinical trial results that would indicate possible or actual impairment of ipr d or goodwill 
since we operate under one reporting segment  goodwill impairment is assessed on our overall market capitalization 
we did not record goodwill impairment during the year ended december  since at year end the company s total market capitalization was in excess of the carrying value of its net assets 
based on our assessment of ipr d using an income approach  we also did not record impairment of ipr d during the year ended december  
table of contents convertible notes at the closing of the avigen merger  we and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as trustee  entered into an indenture 
under the terms of a separate trust agreement  or trust agreement  approximately million  which represented the first payment consideration less approximately million paid out to avigen shareholders who elected cash payment and the initial principal amount of the convertible notes  or convertible notes  was deposited with a trust agent for the benefit of the holders and us 
prior to the maturity of the convertible notes on june   holders of the convertible notes could submit irrevocable conversion notices instructing the trustee to convert such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
following each conversion date we would issue the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon conversion and the trustee would in turn release to us the respective amount of restricted cash to cover the stock issuance 
for the year ended december   approximately  of convertible notes were converted into  shares of our common stock 
all remaining convertible notes matured on june  and the principal was repaid in full 
debt on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  under which we borrowed million at a stated annual interest rate of 
the financing was used to satisfy working capital needs  including the continued clinical development of mn pursuant to the loan agreement  we issued to oxford a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price of per share 
based on a black scholes valuation model  the relative fair value of the warrant was approximately  we accounted for the warrant as a component of stockholders equity as the agreement required settlement in shares and under no provision of the agreement were we required to settle the warrant in cash 
we accounted for the interest on the debt under the effective interest method wherein we treated the debt issuance costs paid directly to the lender and the relative fair value of the warrants issued to the lender as a discount on the debt or a contra liability and we treated the debt issuance costs paid to third parties as an asset 
the amortization of the debt discount was recorded as interest expense and the amortization of the debt issuance costs paid to third parties was recorded as other expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
on april   we entered into an agreement with oxford under which we made an early repayment of the loan in full and wherein oxford waived the prepayment penalty of approximately  reduction in force in january  we had a reduction in force  or rif  to reduce costs 
we believe that we remain adequately staffed given our research and development focus and utilization of external resources 
underwritten firm commitment public offering on march   we consummated a firm commitment underwritten public offering of  units at a price to the public of per unit for gross proceeds of approximately million 
each unit consists of one share of common stock  and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and were issued separately 
on march   the underwriter exercised  units of its  unit overallotment 
the warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance  have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are indexed to our stock and do not permit net cash settlement 
on march   we received net proceeds of approximately million  after underwriter discount and underwriter expenses and no warrants exercised 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  the warrants were classified as equity instruments as they contain no provision which may require cash settlement 

table of contents at the market issuance sales agreement on may   we entered into an at the market or atm issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we could issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
the issuance and sale of these shares by us under the sales agreement  if any  would be subject to the effectiveness of our shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 initially filed with the securities and exchange commission on november  effective october   we terminated the atm between us and mlv 
no shares of common stock were issued under the atm 
lease amendments on july   we entered into a fifth amendment  or the fifth lease amendment  of our lease agreement with la jolla village llc  the landlord 
the fifth lease amendment amends the lease of our headquarters located at la jolla village drive  suite  san diego  california   and extends the lease term with respect to  square feet  from august  to may  the fifth lease amendment provides that we will pay the landlord a monthly base rent of  for the premises during the nine month extension period 
on march   we entered into a sixth amendment  the sixth lease amendment  of our lease agreement with the landlord 
the sixth lease amendment extends the lease term through february  and provides that we will pay the landlord a monthly base rent of  for the premises during the final nine month period kissei stock purchase on october   pursuant to a stock purchase agreement by and between us and kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd  or kissei  kissei purchased for million i an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  par value per share at a price of per share  which approximated the fair value of our common stock at the time of the transaction  and ii  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share  at a price of per share  which approximated the fair value of our preferred stock on an as converted basis at the time of the transaction 
each share of the series b preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock 
the purchase agreement contained customary representations  warranties and covenants and a standstill agreement from kissei that terminates if kissei beneficially owned less than three percent of our outstanding voting stock 
kissei services agreement on october   we entered into an agreement with kissei to perform research and development services relating to mn in exchange for a non refundable upfront payment of million 
under the terms of the agreement  we will be responsible for all costs to be incurred in the performance of these services which are expected to be completed in and we assessed the deliverables in accordance with the authoritative guidance and concluded the existence of one deliverable  research and development services 
as such  we will recognize as revenue the million payment as the research and development services are performed 
the amount received from kissei is recorded on the balance sheet at december  as deferred revenue 
as of december   we have not recorded any revenue in relating to this agreement 
revenues and cost of revenues we recognized no revenues for each of the years in the three year period ended december  we have not generated any revenues from licensing  milestones or product sales to date 
our revenues to date have been generated from providing development management services under master service agreements with asahi 
table of contents kasei pharma corporation and argenes  inc  pursuant to which we billed consulting fees and our pass through clinical contract costs 
the primary costs associated with our revenue were the clinical contract costs we incurred and passed through to our customers 
our agreement with asahi kasei pharma corporation has been completed  and we terminated our agreement with argenes  inc  and we will not generate any further revenue from these agreements 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of the license fees related to our product candidates  salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product development programs  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  and pre commercialization manufacturing development activities 
we use external service providers to manufacture our compounds to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  therefore  these research and development expenses consist substantially of external costs  such as fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses consist of costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product development programs 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in thousands product candidate disease indication year ended december  mn acute exacerbations of asthma and copd mn multiple sclerosis other cns disorders mn bronchial asthma and interstitial cystitis mn interstitial cystitis mn solid tumors mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn thrombotic disorders unallocated total research and development in we decided to focus our resources on the development of our two prioritized product development programs  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
in the third quarter of  we decided to expand the development program for mn to evaluate mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
in the second quarter of we completed the phase clinical trial of mn ibudilast for the treatment of ms and in december we continue to pursue discussions with potential partners  including government funding agencies  to secure a strategic collaboration 
as such  we do not plan to undertake any further significant clinical development of mn until such time that we secure a strategic collaboration to advance the combined ibudilast based development program 
we do expect our 
table of contents research and development expenses to increase in connection with clinical trials primarily related to mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations  and any other development activities that it may initiate 
while on march  we announced completion of the patient enrollment of the phase mn cl clinical trial with expected trial results in the second quarter of  due to the risks inherent in clinical trials  we are unable to estimate the acceptability or unacceptability of these results 
we will continue to limit our expenditures on the remainder of our existing product candidates to only those activities deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize the value of such product candidates  if any  while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product development 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will remain low for the remainder of our existing product candidates in future periods 
general and administrative our general and administrative costs primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal  information systems support functions  facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if we are required to expand our infrastructure based on the success of our current prioritized product development programs and in raising capital to support those and other product development programs or otherwise in connection with increased business development activities related to partnering  out licensing or product disposition 
debt related charge on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with oxford finance corporation  or oxford  under which we borrowed million 
the oxford loan had an original maturity of august  to preserve cash by eliminating future interest payments  on april  we entered into an agreement with oxford under which we made an early repayment of the loan in full and wherein oxford waived the prepayment penalty of approximately  in recording the loan repayment  we wrote off the unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs related to the loan  which resulted in a write off of approximately million recorded in our statement of operations as interest expense 
investment securities our investment securities have consisted of auction rate securities  or ars  which principally represented insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper  and had aaa ratings at the time of purchase 
we have not held investment securities since july  we designated our investment securities portfolio as trading investment securities  and any change in the fair value of our investment securities was recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations 
in  we received the right to sell to ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our investment securities  the ars held in accounts with ubs at par value at any time during the period beginning june  and ending july  the ars put 
concurrently  ubs also provided to us a no net cost loan program the ars loan whereby we could borrow up to percent of the market value of our ars that had been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest being paid on the underlying ars investments 
we valued the ars on a level basis  as defined by asc  using a discounted cash flow valuation model with subsequent increase or decrease in their fair value recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents we exercised our ars put on june   and in july the ubs ars were redeemed at par value and the associated ars loan was repaid  resulting in a net gain of approximately  recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as other income 
foreign exchange gain loss to date  we have conducted most of our clinical trials in the us however  we have had clinical sites located in europe  australia and new zealand in which certain related invoices were denominated in local currencies  and  we currently have certain vendors from whom we receive invoices denominated in japanese yen and in british pound 
we do not hedge our foreign exchange exposure 
foreign exchange gain loss is based on the difference between the exchange rate at the transaction date and the exchange rate at the settlement date  or the balance sheet date if the transaction has not yet been settled 
other expense other expense primarily consists of accretion related to the convertible notes and the amortization of debt issuance costs paid to third parties 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest charged on our ars loan  interest charged on our long term debt based on the effective interest method and amortization of debt discount 
other income other income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting estimates include our recognition of research and development expenses  which impacts operating expenses and accrued liabilities  and stock based compensation  which impacts operating expenses 
we review our estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials  costs associated with non clinical activities such as regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses and fees paid to external service providers who conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we use 
table of contents external service providers and vendors to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other products and services related to our product development programs 
research and development expenses also include fees for licensed technology for which technological feasibility has not been established and there are no alternative uses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan 
the benefits provided under both of these plans requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
valuation of our stock option grants require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 
stock option compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identified net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions require extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets as a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets that have finite useful lives require the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
as of december  and  we had goodwill and ipr d recorded of million and million  respectively 
our annual test date for goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment is december or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value measurements we are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value  either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting 
we use fair value extensively in the initial measurement of net assets 
table of contents acquired in a business combination and when accounting for and reporting on investment securities and certain financial instruments or assets 
we estimate fair value using an exit price approach  which requires  among other things  that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market of market participants  considering the highest and best use of assets and  for liabilities  assuming the risk of non performance will be the same before and after the transfer 
many  but not all  of our financial instruments are carried at fair value 
in addition  as required under accounting rules for business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the avigen transaction on december  have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
for information on fair value for our financial instruments  see notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements other than intangibles and goodwill 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued updated guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment 
the updated guidance permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  the updated guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued a guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present items of net income and other comprehensive income  or oci  and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but continuous statements 
we will no longer be allowed to present oci in the statement of stockholders equity 
earnings per share would continue to be based on net income 
although existing guidance related to items that must be presented in oci has not changed  companies will be required to display reclassification adjustments for each component of oci in both net income and oci 
also  companies will need to present the components of other comprehensive income in their interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance is required to be implemented retrospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december  and becomes effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that clarified and amended the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified the intent of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the new and revised disclosures are required to be implemented prospectively during interim and annual periods beginning after december  and become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal year early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

other income other income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower yields earned on invested balances as we converted higher yielding investment securities into cash and cash equivalents during our investment balances are currently held in money market accounts and funds to preserve liquidity and principal

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we incurred losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of million  million and million to fund our operating activities for the years ended december    and  respectively 
to date  these operating losses have been funded primarily through the private placement of our equity securities  the public sale of our common stock  long term debt  clinical development agreements with partners and the exercise of founders warrants  net of treasury stock repurchases 
on march   we announced a firm commitment underwritten public offering of  units at a price to the public of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consists of one share of common stock  and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
the shares of common stock and warrants are immediately separable and were issued separately 
on march   the underwriter exercised  units of its  unit overallotment 
on october   pursuant to a stock purchase agreement by and between us and kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd  or kissei  kissei purchased i an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  par value per share at a price of per share  and ii  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
in october we received gross proceeds of approximately million related to this purchase agreement 
on october   we entered into an agreement with kissei to perform research and development services relating to mn in exchange for a non refundable upfront payment of million 
we will be responsible for all costs to be incurred in the performance of these services which are expected to be completed in and we assessed the deliverables in accordance with the authoritative guidance and concluded the existence of one deliverable  research and development services 
as such  we will recognize as revenue the million payment as the research and development services are performed 
the amount received from kissei is recorded on the balance sheet at december  as deferred revenue 
as of december   we have not recorded any revenue in relating to this agreement 
our current cash and cash equivalents are our principal source of liquidity 
we expect to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations  including research and development of our product development candidates and clinical trials 
it is our belief that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations through at least december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
we have had  and will continue to have an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations including the activities required to bring our future products to market 
we have an established history of raising capital through equity and debt  and management plans to continue financing operations with equity issuances  debt arrangements or a combination thereof 
if adequate funds are not available  we might be required to delay  reduce the scope of or terminate one or more of our product development programs and or implement other operating cost reductions  any of which could result in the termination of license rights related to any of our product candidates 
other significant cash and contractual obligations the following summarizes our scheduled long term contractual obligations that may affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations total 
table of contents under the license agreements for our product candidates  we may be required to make future payments based upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to clinical development  regulatory or commercial events 
we will also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products  if any are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot determine when  or if  the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur at present 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to conduct our clinical trials  manufacture our product candidates  perform data collection and analysis and other services in connection with our product development programs 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our product development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments and we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million and were primarily invested in money market interest bearing accounts and money market funds 
a hypothetical adverse change in the average interest rate on our money market cash investments and short term investments would have had no material effect on net income for the year ended december
