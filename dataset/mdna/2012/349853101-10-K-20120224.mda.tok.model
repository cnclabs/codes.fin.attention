item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american expedited ground freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including tlx  dedicated fleets  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
fasi provides pool distribution services throughout the mid atlantic  southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
pool distribution involves managing high frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions 
our primary customers for this product are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers  such as mall  strip mall and outlet based retail chains 
we service these customers through a network of terminals and service centers located in cities 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound or carton for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses  such as tlx  which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
trends and developments results from operations during the year ended december   we experienced a and increase in our consolidated revenues and income from operations  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the increase in our consolidated revenue and income from operations was driven by our forward air segment in which we experienced a increase in revenue and a increase in income from operations 
we largely attribute the increase in forward air revenue and income from operations to increased shipping volumes  additional net fuel surcharge and general rate increases initiated in may and june fasi revenue was consistent year over year  increasing during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  fasi s year over year revenue growth was impeded by customer losses during which were mostly offset by new business wins during in particular  during the second quarter of  we ceased providing services to one of fasi s largest customers at the time 
these customer losses resulted in approximately million less fasi revenue in compared to  but these losses were mostly offset by new customer wins and increased fuel surcharge revenue 
while the customer losses mitigated revenue growth during  the lost revenue was low yielding and the impact on operating results from curtailing these services was minimal 
fasi results from operations did improve million and over  from a million loss in to million in income from operations during 
the improvement in fasi s results from operations was the result of improved business mix  as the low yield business discontinued in was replaced with better priced and more effectively integrated new business  and improved cargo claim experience 
throughout fuel prices increased notably over our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates  which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon  and the tonnage transiting our network 
the increase in shipping activity combined with the increasing diesel fuel prices have resulted in an increase in our net fuel surcharge revenue 
total net fuel surcharge revenue increased during compared to segments our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 

table of contents our forward air segment includes our airport to airport network  forward air complete  and tlx services as well as our other accessorial related services such as warehousing  customs brokerage  and value added handling services 
our fasi segment includes our pool distribution business 
goodwill during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the economic recession experienced in and the resulting declines in market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test 
we calculated the fair value of the fasi segment  using a combination of discounted cash flows and current market valuations for comparable companies 
based on the results of the interim impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of in accordance with our accounting policy  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for each reporting unit as of june  and no further impairment charges were required 
in addition  due to fasi s results from operations not meeting our projections for the nine months ended september   we conducted an impairment test of goodwill for the fasi reporting unit as of september  there were no impairment charges required as a result of the september  fasi impairment test 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill related to the forward air and fasi segments was million and million  respectively 
the estimation of fair value related to the impairment test for goodwill is particularly sensitive to projected financial information used in the calculations 
earnings estimated to be generated by our forward air segment are expected to continue supporting the carrying value of its goodwill 
our fasi segment is currently facing the challenges of building  expanding and diversifying its revenue base 
if fasi s efforts are significantly delayed  future estimates of projected financial information may be reduced  and we may be required to record an impairment charge against the carrying value of fasi s goodwill

our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  excluding the impact of fuel surcharges and complete  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  tonnage that transited our network increased by during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  average base revenue per pound increased as a result of general rate increases implemented in june and may the remaining increase in airport to airport revenue is the result of increased net fuel surcharge revenue and complete pick up and delivery revenue 
net fuel surcharge revenue increased million  or  during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher average fuel prices and increased overall business volumes 
complete pick up and delivery revenue increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the increase in complete revenue is attributable to an increased attachment rate of the complete service to our standard airport to airport service to in compared to in and the overall improvement in airport to airport tonnage volumes during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  logistics revenue  which is primarily tlx and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  tlx revenue increased million year over year as tlx average revenue per mile increased approximately and miles driven to support our tlx revenue increased 
the increase in miles and average revenue per mile is mainly attributable to new business wins 
the remaining million increase in logistics revenue was attributable to increases in other non mileage based logistic revenues  such as drayage services 
the increase in non mileage based services was in conjunction with the improvement in tlx business volumes 

table of contents other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in other pick up and delivery services as well as handling and sorting services that primarily increased in conjunction with the increase in our airport to airport business

intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi 
fasi also provided cartage and station agent services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced airport to airport and truckload services forward air provided to fasi

the increase in miles increased purchased transportation by million while the increase in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased in conjunction with the tonnage increase discussed above 
the increase in airport to airport cost per mile was mostly the result of increased utilization of more costly third party transportation providers as opposed to our network of owner operators and various changes to the compensation packages for our network of owner operators 
we increased our use of third party transportation provides in order to fill the capacity required by the increased business volumes discussed above 
the remaining increase was attributable to a million increase in third party transportation costs associated with the increased complete volumes and attachment rates discussed above 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase in logistics purchased transportation was largely attributable to the million  or  increase in tlx purchased transportation 
miles driven to support our tlx revenue increased but the cost per mile was consistent year over year 
other non mileage based logistics purchased transportation costs related to our drayage and other services increased million 

table of contents purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue is attributable to the reduced use of more costly third party transportation providers  as opposed to company employed drivers or our network of owner operators  to provide the transportation services associated with our other revenues  such as freight and container transfers and other miscellaneous pick up and delivery services 
in addition  the decrease in other purchased transportation costs is also attributable to rate reductions received from pick up and delivery transportation providers in certain large markets 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in fasi purchased transportation in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue was attributable to our continued efforts to convert from company employed drivers to owner operators and certain new business having an increased linehaul component which increased the utilization of owner operators and third party transportation providers 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year end december  fasi also provided cartage services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced airport to airport and truckload services forward air provided to fasi 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during the year ended december  compared to in december forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in salaries  wages  and benefits as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to a million  or as a percentage of revenue  decrease in workers compensation losses 
the decrease in workers compensation losses resulted from a current year reduction of workers compensation loss development reserves as a result of the current year actuary analysis as well as reduced current year claims 
also  contributing to the improvement in salaries  wages and benefits was a decline in employee incentives as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in employee incentives as a percentage of revenue was largely due to reduced accruals for quarterly and annual performance goals 
the remaining improvement in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is the result of the increase in revenue outpacing the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits 
the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits in total dollars is largely due to increased variable wages  primarily dock and terminal employees  which increased in conjunction with the volume increases discussed previously 
fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits of fasi decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits are higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers 
the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to reduced dock wages  company employed driver pay  workers compensation and health insurance claims and administrative compensation 
as noted above  to move fasi to a more variable cost structure  we continued to shift  wherever feasible  from company employed drivers to owner operators 
as a result  we reduced pay to company employed drivers by as a percentage of revenue 
also  for the year ended december  we reduced our dock wages by as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december  the 
table of contents improvement in dock wages is largely the result of efficiencies gained by installing conveyor systems in our larger facilities and replacing contract labor with company employed dock personnel 
workers compensation claims and groups insurance also decreased approximately as a percentage of revenue on improved current year claim experience and reductions of workers compensation loss development reserves as a result of the current year actuary analysis 
the remaining improvement in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is the result of reduced administrative salaries and benefits as a result of our on going efforts to control fasi costs 
operating leases operating leases increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the million increase was the result of a million increase in facility rent and million increase in trailer rentals 
facility rent increased as certain existing terminals were relocated to larger facilities during the last half of trailer rentals increased to provide additional capacity until new trailers were purchased during the third quarter of fasi operating leases decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the million decrease was attributable to lower facility rent and reduced costs for leased tractors and vehicles 
office rent decreased million due to a full year of rent savings on the consolidation of over lapping facilities with forward air 
leased tractors and vehicles declined million as leased equipment was replaced with either owner operator units or company owned units 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation is attributable to a million increase in depreciation on forklifts and new computers and related equipment offset by a million decrease in trailer and tractor depreciation and a million decrease in building amortization 
the decrease in trailer and tractor depreciation was attributable to older equipment becoming fully depreciated partially offset by depreciation on new trailers and tractors purchased in the third quarter of the decline in building amortization is due to the termination of a facility capital lease during the third quarter of fasi depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily attributable to new tractors  vehicles and conveyor systems purchased during the second half of and the first half of 
table of contents insurance and claims insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims was of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air forward air insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in insurance and claims was the result of a million increase in reserves for claims and loss development and a million increase in accident related vehicle damage 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline in legal and professional fees associated with vehicle and cargo claims 
the million increase in reserves for claims and loss development is attributable to increased known reserves for certain accidents and additional loss development required by the current year actuary analysis 
the increase in accident related vehicle damage is primarily the result of damage repairs required on rented trailers and tractors 
fasi fasi insurance and claims decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reduced cargo claims 
we attribute the decline in cargo claims to improvements in our security and processes to investigate and resolve missing or damaged freight 
fuel expense fuel expense increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  forward air forward air fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the years ended december  and the increase in total dollars is attributable to increased mileage activity as well as increased average fuel prices during the year end december  compared to the year ended december  fasi fasi fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in average fuel prices during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net of reductions in miles driven by company owned or leased units 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in other 
table of contents operating expenses is attributable to increased variable costs  such as vehicle maintenance and dock supplies  during the year ended december   and the other operating expenses for the year ended december  being reduced by a million gain on the termination of a capital lease 
forward air variable costs increased during the year ended december   in conjunction with the shipping volume increases discussed previously  and decreased as a percentage of revenue as these increases were outpaced by the increase in forward air revenue 
fasi fasi other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reductions in dock supplies and savings from combining facilities with forward air 
the fasi customer losses discussed above were largely responsible for a million decrease in dock supplies due to the discontinued customers packing requirements 
fasi s utility  property taxes and other facility related costs were reduced by approximately million primarily due to a full year of cost reductions associated with combining certain locations with forward air facilities 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the years ended december  and income from operations income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily the result of the increased revenue discussed previously and the resulting positive leverage the additional revenue provides against the fixed costs of the forward air network 
also  as discussed previously  contributing to the improvement in results was the favorable workers compensation reserve adjustment partially offset by increased reserves for vehicle accidents 
fasi fasi results from operations improved by million to million of income from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with the loss from operations being of operating revenue for the year ended december  the improvement in fasi s results from operations was primarily driven by lower health and workers compensation losses  the discontinuance of low yield business and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and control variable and controllable costs such as cargo claims 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  and decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the maturity of capital lease arrangements and the corresponding decrease in associated interest expense 
other  net other  net was income of million for the years ended december  and 
table of contents provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the reenactment of certain tax credits which originally expired in but were extended through and made retroactive for at this time the related tax credits have expired and will not be available in  unless extended by congress 
further reducing our effective tax rate was a million reduction of income tax contingency reserves due to the lapsing of statutes on certain state income tax filings 
finally  contributing to the decrease in our effective tax rate is the increase in our net income before income taxes combined with reductions in non deductible expenses such as share based compensation for incentive stock options 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth our historical financial data for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  december  percent change change operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation salaries  wages  and employee benefits operating leases depreciation and amortization insurance and claims fuel expense other operating expenses impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest expense other  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income

average base revenue per pound increased as a result of a general rate increase implemented on may  the remaining increase in airport to airport revenue is the result of increased net fuel surcharge revenue and complete pick up and delivery revenue 
net fuel surcharge revenue increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher average fuel prices and increased overall business volumes 
complete pick up and delivery revenue increased million during the year ended december  compared to the increase in complete revenue is attributable to an increased attachment rate of the complete service to our standard airport to airport service and the overall improvement in tonnage volumes during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  logistics revenue  which is primarily tlx and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  tlx revenue increased million and year over year as tlx average revenue per mile increased approximately in compared to while miles driven to support our tlx revenue increased from to similar to our airport to airport service  tlx miles increased in conjunction with the improving economy and the resulting increase in shipping activity 
the increase in average revenue per mile is mainly attributable to increased fuel surcharges as a result of higher fuel prices and increased yield per mile as the increase in shipping activity has resulted in decreased available truckload capacity and reduced truckload price competition 
the remaining million increase in logistics revenue was attributable to increases in other non mileage based logistic revenues  such as drayage 
the increase in non mileage based services was in conjunction with the improvement in tlx business volumes 

table of contents other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in local terminal handling and sorting services  such as freight and container transfers  that increased in conjunction with our efforts to increase terminal utilization during off peak hours 
fasi fasi operating revenue was million for both the year ended december  and fasi operating revenue was consistent year over year in total  but included significant customer losses discussed above that were offset by various new business wins for which service began at various times throughout and the customer losses resulted in approximately million less fasi revenue in compared to the new business wins were largely expansion of services with previously existing customers

these alternate revenue streams often require the use of more costly third party transportation providers  as opposed to company employed drivers or our network of owner operators 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in fasi purchased transportation in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue is attributable to our efforts to shift fasi to a more variable cost model by increasing the use of owner operators as opposed to company employed drivers 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million for the years ended december  and the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year end december  fasi also provided cartage services to forward air

employee incentives increased million on achievement of quarterly and annual performance goals for the year ended december  workers compensation claims increased million on increases in loss development reserves associated with prior period claims 
health insurance claims increased million primarily as a result of a small number of individually large medical claims that reached our self insured limits during the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in share based compensation 
the decrease in share based compensation was mainly due to final vesting of our stock option awards partially offset by stock option grants to key employees 
the remaining million increase is associated with increased variable wages  primarily dock employees  which increased in conjunction with the increased business volumes discussed above

the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to reduced dock wages  company employed driver pay and reduced workers compensation and health insurance claims 
as noted above  to move fasi to a more variable cost structure  we are in the process of shifting  wherever feasible  from company employed drivers to owner operators 
as a result  we reduced pay to company employed drivers by as a percentage of revenue 
also  for the year ended december  we reduced our dock wages by as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december  the improvement in dock wages is largely the result of efficiencies gained by installing conveyor systems in our larger facilities and replacing contract labor with company employed dock personnel 
workers compensation claims and employee health insurance also decreased approximately as a percentage of revenue on improved current year claim experience 

table of contents these decreases were partially offset by a increase in employee incentives and share based compensation 
employee incentives increased as a percentage of revenue due to certain terminals and employees reaching quarterly performance goals 
the increase in share based compensation is attributable to stock option awards to key fasi employees 
operating leases operating leases decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in operating leases is mostly attributable to a million decrease in office rent 
the decline in office rent was the result of completing our new regional hub in dallas fort worth at the beginning of the third quarter of in conjunction with the opening of this facility we were able to move out of the previously leased facilities and reduce operating lease expense 
this reduction has been partially offset by certain existing terminals being relocated to larger facilities 
fasi operating leases decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  approximately million of the decrease was attributable to lower facility rent due to the consolidation of duplicate facilities after our acquisitions 
the remaining million decrease is the result of the turn in of previously leased or rented vehicles and trailers

insurance premiums decreased million as a result of a decrease in insurance premiums compared to on renewed and renegotiated insurance plans and reductions of reserves for premium audits related to previous years 
reserves for current year vehicle accidents and cargo claims decreased million on improved claims experience 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in legal and professional fees primarily associated with the litigation of prior year accidents and claims 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily due to a reduction in of our loss development reserves for vehicle claims resulting from an actuarial analysis of our vehicle claims 
no similar reduction occurred in fuel expense fuel expense increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  and forward air forward air fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the years ended december  and the increase in total dollars is attributable to increased mileage activity as well as increased average fuel prices during the year end december  compared to the year ended december  fasi fasi fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in average fuel prices during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net of reductions in miles driven by company owned units 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in other operating expenses in total dollars was attributable to increases in variable costs  such as dock supplies  vehicle maintenance and tolls  which increased as a result of the increased business volumes discussed previously 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain recognized on the termination of a capital lease for a building located near our columbus  ohio hub facility 

table of contents fasi fasi other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reductions in vehicle maintenance  dock supplies and cost control efforts 
vehicle maintenance decreased million on reductions in leased and rented vehicles due to the turn in of leased and rented vehicles assumed with the acquisitions 
the fasi customer losses discussed above were largely responsible for a million decrease in dock supplies due to the discontinued customers packing requirements 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill was of consolidated operating revenue for year ended december  there were no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in forward air impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million  or  of forward air s operating revenue  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   forward air recorded a non cash million charge to write off the net book value of certain truckload and cargo handling customer relationships that had been discontinued during forward air had no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in fasi during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was made based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during forward air solutions had no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in results from operations income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily the result of the increased revenues discussed above and the resulting positive leverage the additional revenues provide against the fixed costs of the forward air network 
fasi fasi loss from operations decreased by million  or  to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi loss from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in fasi s loss from operations was primarily driven by the million non cash  goodwill impairment charge incurred in the remaining decrease in fasi s loss from operations was attributable to the discontinuance of low yield business and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and control variable and discretionary costs 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million for the years ended december  and other income  net other  net was income of million for the years ended december  and provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the increase in our income before income taxes combined with a decrease in share based compensation on incentive stock options 
the share based compensation for incentive stock options is mostly not deductible for income tax reporting 
also  decreasing the provision for income taxes during was a million reduction in the valuation allowance associated with a decrease in fasi s net deferred tax assets 
during  we increased the valuation allowance on fasi s net deferred tax assets by million 
in addition  the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was increased by a million reserve for a state income tax contingency 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at for forward air and for fasi 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance 
table of contents for approximately days dependent upon experience in the preceding twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and employee health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and employee health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize actuarial analysis to evaluate open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
revenue recognition operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are completed 
the transportation rates we charge our customers consist of base transportation rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the revenues earned and related direct freight expenses incurred from our base transportation services are recognized on a gross basis in revenue and in purchased transportation 
transportation revenue is recognized on a gross basis as we are the primary obligor 
the fuel surcharges billed to customers and paid to owner operators and third party transportation providers are recorded on a net basis in revenue as we are not the primary obligor with regards to the fuel surcharges 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
also  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire between and the use of these state net operating losses is limited to the future taxable income of separate legal entities 
based on expectations of future taxable income  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net operating loss benefits for million in state loss carryforwards 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been provided for million of these state loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance on these certain state loss carryforwards was approximately million at december  and we have also established a valuation allowance of less than million on the state portion of fasi s net deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was established based on expectations of future taxable income as management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of fasi operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the state benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
due to a reduction in fasi net deferred tax assets  this valuation allowance was reduced by less than million from december 
table of contents valuation of goodwill we conduct an annual or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment impairment test of goodwill for each reporting unit at june of each year 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is the estimation of each reporting unit s fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the calculated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these fair value estimates and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we calculate the fair value of the applicable reportable segments  using a combination of discounted projected cash flows and market valuations as of the valuation date for comparable companies 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the judgments and assumptions made in the fair value calculations and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the estimation of fair value related to the impairment test for goodwill is particularly sensitive to projected financial information used in the calculations 
our fair value calculations for goodwill are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as defined in the fasb codification 
for example  during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policy discussed above as of march  based on the results of the interim impairment test  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
consequently  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of share based compensation our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
for employees  we have granted stock options  non vested shares and performance shares 
for non employee directors  we have granted non vested shares annually beginning in stock options typically expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for stock options are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
based on our historical experience  forfeitures were estimated 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted 
the following table contains the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
december  december  december  expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate expected life of options years the fair value of non vested shares issued were estimated using the closing market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period or vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
during  we granted performance shares to key employees 
under the terms of the performance share agreements  on the third anniversary of the grant date  we will issue to the employees a calculated number of common stock shares based on the three year performance of our common stock share price as compared to the share price performance of a selected peer group 
no shares may be issued if the share price performance outperforms or less of the peer group  but the number of shares issued will be increased if the share price performs better than of the peer group 
the fair value of the performance shares was estimated using a monte carlo simulation with a risk free rate of return of and a three year volatility of 
the share based compensation for performance shares are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 

table of contents under the espp  which has been approved by our shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
operating leases certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term 
for these leases  we recognize the related rental expenses on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which includes any rent holiday period  and records the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amount paid as rent as a rent liability 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial term of the lease 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb expanded the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the expanded disclosures required a greater level of disaggregated information and additional disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
the amendment required expanded disclosures on transfers in and out of level and level fair values  activity in level investments and inputs and valuation techniques 
for level fair value measurements  the disclosure requirements were effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the provisions of this amendment required for periods beginning after december  did not have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued additional amendments to its fair value guidance in order to improve comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
these new amendments were not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting  but to explain how to measure fair value 
these amendments require additional disclosures for transfer between level and level of the fair value hierarchy  sensitivity of level fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs and categorization by level of the fair value hierarchy for items required to be disclosed 
these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of the new amendments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statement disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued amendments to its goodwill and intangible asset guidance to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under these new amendments  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
these amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of these amendments may impact how we assess goodwill impairment but will not have a significant effect on our financial statement results or disclosures 
in  the fasb issued amendments to require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
these amendments eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
as we do not currently have any items of comprehensive income  we will not be required to report comprehensive income and therefore at this time these amendments are not expected to significantly impact our financial statement presentation or disclosures 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital expenditures  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to a million increase in net earnings after consideration of non cash items and a million decrease in cash used to fund payables and other assets 
these sources of cash were offset by a million reduction in cash provided by accounts receivable 
the decrease in cash used to fund payables and other assets was primarily attributable to increased income taxes payable as current income tax expenses increased by a larger amount than our estimated tax payments 
the decrease in cash from accounts receivable is largely attributable to the increase in business volumes during the year ended december   resulting in revenues that will not be collected until early net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of capital expenditures for new tractors  trailers and vehicles to replace aging units 
the million of proceeds from disposal of property and equipment is primarily from sales of older vehicles replaced by recent purchases 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  mainly included a million payment on our line of credit  million used for the repurchase of our common stock  million used for our quarterly dividend payments and million of scheduled capital lease payments 
the year over year increase in cash used for financing activities is attributable to the payment on our line of credit and the repurchases of our shares during  there was no comparable activity in these uses of cash were partially offset by a million increase in cash from the exercise of stock options and the related tax benefit 
we currently have access to a million senior credit facility that expires in october interest rates for advances under the senior credit facility are at libor plus to based upon covenants related to total indebtedness to earnings 
at december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility  not including the accordion feature  and had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit 
in february  we terminated the million credit facility and entered into a new million credit facility 
this new facility has a term of five years and matures in february the company entered into this larger credit facility in order to fund potential acquisitions  the repurchase of its common stock  and for financing other general business purposes 
interest rates for advances under the facility are libor plus to based upon covenants related to total indebtedness to earnings 
the agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions  none of which are expected to significantly affect our operations or ability to pay dividends 
no assets are pledged as collateral against the credit facility 
in july  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program repurchase plan for up to two million shares of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of common stock under the repurchase plan for million  or an average cost of per share 
as of december    shares remain that may be repurchased under the repurchase plan 
during each quarter of  and  cash dividends of per share were declared on common stock outstanding 
we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
we believe that our available cash  investments  expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under the available senior credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from banks totaling million required primarily by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period and total thereafter capital lease obligations equipment purchase commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations not included in the above table are reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and for self insurance claims of million and million  respectively 
the equipment purchase commitments are for various trailers  vehicles and forklifts 
all of the above commitments are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flows from operations 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  as defined in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to future events or our future financial performance 
some forward looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as believes  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  projects or expects 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following is a list of factors  among others  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements economic factors such as recessions  inflation  higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles  our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network  increasing competition and pricing pressure  surplus inventories  loss of a major customer  the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered  our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates  the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network  changes in fuel prices  claims for property damage  personal injuries or workers compensation  employment matters including rising health care costs  enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations  environmental and tax matters  the handling of hazardous materials  the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions 
as a result of the foregoing  no assurance can be given as to future financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility  for which no balance was outstanding at december   bears interest at variable rates 
based on our average outstanding borrowings in  a hypothetical increase in our senior credit facility borrowing rate of basis points  or an increase in the total effective interest rate from to  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately million 
our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling million 
these lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations 
we are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of diesel fuel  as more fully discussed in item a  risk factors 
our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk
