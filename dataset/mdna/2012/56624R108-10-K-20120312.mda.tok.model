we also offer a private label platform for publishers  separate and distinct from our small business solutions which enable them to monetize their web sites with contextual advertising from their own customers or from our advertising relationships 
we sell pay per click contextual advertising placements on specialized vertical and branded publisher web sites on a pay per click basis

we believe our site and page specific approach provides publishers with an opportunity to generate revenue from their traffic while protecting their brand 
our approach gives advertisers greater transparency into the source of the traffic and relevancy for their ads and enables them to optimize the return on investment from their advertising campaign

it includes more than  of our owned and operated web sites focused on helping users make informed decisions about where to get local products and services 
it features listings from more than million small business listings in the us and millions of expert and user generated reviews on small businesses

com  openlist 
com and geo targeted sites 
traffic to our proprietary web sites is primarily monetized with pay for call and pay per click listings that are relevant to the web sites  as well as other forms of advertising  including banner advertising 
feed management and related services 
through the end of  we used our proprietary technology to crawl and extract relevant product content from advertisers databases and web sites to create automated and highly targeted product and service listings feed  which we delivered primarily into yahoo s search submit product 
advertisers generally paid us a fixed price for each click they received on an advertisement or listing included in the feed 
in addition and as a supplement to feed management services  we offered campaign management services to enable our advertisers to consolidate the purchasing  management  optimization and reporting from their search and vertical advertising campaigns across a large number of search engines  local web sites and pay per click networks in one central location 
under these services advertisers paid us a pre negotiated rate for each click they receive on their advertisement placed or managed as part of our campaign management services 
yahoo discontinued its feed management service relationship with us effective december  as a result of its partnership with microsoft 
accordingly  we discontinued our feed management and related service offerings as of that date 
we generated million in revenues from feed management and related services for the year ended december  the impact on our financial statements attributable to our ending this service is lessened by the relatively low operating margin attributable to this service given our revenue share arrangement with yahoo with respect thereto 
we were incorporated in delaware on january  acquisition initiatives have played an important part in our corporate history to date 
we currently have offices in seattle  washington  las vegas  nevada  billerica  massachusetts  and new york  new york 

table of contents acquisition on april   the company acquired of the stock of jingle networks  inc jingle a provider of mobile voice search performance advertising and technology solutions in north america for the following consideration approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  and  shares of the company s class b common stock paid at closing  plus future consideration of i million  net of certain working capital adjustments on the first anniversary of the closing  and ii million on the th month anniversary of closing  with the future consideration payable in either cash or shares of the company s class b common stock or some combination to be determined by marchex 
any shares issued in payment of the future consideration will be increased by 
following the closing  we issued  shares of restricted stock at an aggregate value of approximately million to employees of jingle  subject to vesting for up to four years 
the fair value of the shares of class b common stock issued as part of the consideration paid was valued at million using the company s closing stock price of per share at the acquisition date 
the fair value of the future consideration payments of million  was determined using a rate of approximately based on the company s incremental borrowing rate and is recorded as current deferred acquisition payments in the balance sheet 
consolidated statements of operations the assets  liabilities and operations of our acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements as of the date of the respective acquisitions 
all significant inter company transactions and balances within marchex have been eliminated in consolidation 
our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities from our acquisitions being recorded at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates 
all goodwill  intangible assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisitions have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
presentation of financial reporting periods the comparative periods presented are for the years ended december   and revenue we currently generate revenue through our call advertising services  pay per click advertising  small business solutions products which include our call and click services  proprietary web site traffic  and historically our feed management and related services 
our primary sources of revenue are the performance based advertising services  which include pay for call services  pay per click services  cost per action services and historically our feed management and related services 
these primary sources amounted to greater than of our revenues in all periods presented 
our secondary sources of revenue are our small business solutions products which enable partner resellers to sell call advertising and or search marketing products  campaign management services  and natural search optimization services 
these secondary sources amounted to less than of our revenues in all periods presented 
we have no barter transactions 
we recognize revenue upon the completion of our performance obligation  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
performance based advertising services in providing call advertising services and pay per click advertising  we generate revenue upon our delivery of qualified and reported phone calls or click throughs to our advertisers or advertising service providers listings 
these advertisers and advertising service providers pay us a designated transaction fee for each phone call or click through  which occurs when a user makes a phone call or clicks on any of their advertisement listings after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each phone call or click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
the advertisement listings are displayed within our distribution network  which includes mobile and online search engines and applications  directories  destination sites  shopping engines  third party internet domains or web sites  our portfolio of owned web sites  other targeted web based content and offline sources 
we also generate revenue from cost per action services  which occurs when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action 
we generate revenue from reseller partners and publishers utilizing our small business solutions products to sell call advertising and or search marketing products 
we are paid account fees and also agency fees for our products in the form of a percentage of the cost of every call or click delivered to advertisers 
the reseller partners or publishers engage the advertisers and are the primary obligor  and we  in certain instances  are only financially liable to the publishers in our capacity as a collection agency for the amount collected from the advertisers 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the net revenue recognition method 
in limited arrangements resellers pay us a fee for fulfilling an advertiser s campaign in our distribution network and we act as the primary obligor 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the gross revenue recognition method 
in providing pay per click contextual targeting services  advertisers purchase keywords or keyword strings  based on an amount they choose for a targeted placement on vertically focused web sites or specific pages of a web site that are specific to their products or services and their marketing objectives 
the contextual results distributed by our services are prioritized for users by the amount the advertiser is willing to pay each time a user clicks on the merchant s advertisement and the relevance of the merchant s advertisement  which is dictated by historical click through rates 
advertisers pay us when a click through occurs on their advertisement 
prior to  we provided feed management services in which advertisers pay for their web pages and product databases to be crawled  or searched  and included in search engine  directory and product shopping engine results within our distribution network 
generally  the feed management listings are presented in a different section of the web page than the pay per click listings 
for this service  revenue is generated when an online user clicks on a feed management listing from search engine  directory or product shopping engine results 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction for which the advertiser pays for on a per click basis 
the placement of a feed management result is largely determined by its relevancy  as determined by the distribution partner 
yahoo discontinued its feed management service relationship with us effective december  as a result of its partnership with microsoft 
accordingly  we discontinued our feed management and related service offerings as of that date 
search marketing services advertisers pay us additional fees for services such as campaign management and natural search engine optimization 
advertisers generally pay us on a click through basis  although in certain cases we receive a fixed fee for delivery of these services 
in some cases we also deliver banner campaigns for select advertisers 
we may also charge initial set up  account  service or inclusion fees as part of our services 

table of contents banner advertising revenue may be based on a fixed fee per click and is generated and recognized on click through activity 
in other cases  banner payment terms are volume based with revenue generated and recognized when impressions are delivered 
non refundable account set up fees are paid by advertisers and are recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the contract or the average expected advertiser relationship period  which generally ranges from twelve months to more than two years 
other account and service fees are recognized in the month or period the account fee or services relate to 
industry and market factors we enter into agreements with various mobile  online and offline distribution partners to provide distribution for pay for call and pay per click advertisement listings which contain call tracking numbers and or url strings of our advertisers 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a percentage of revenue or a fixed amount for each phone call or per click through on these listings 
the level of phone calls and click throughs contributed by our distribution partners has varied  and we expect it will continue to vary  from quarter to quarter and year to year  sometimes significantly 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements  replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to grow will be impacted by our ability to increase our distribution  which impacts the number of mobile and internet users who have access to our advertisers listings and the rate at which our advertisers are able to convert calls and clicks from these mobile and internet users into completed transactions  such as a purchase or sign up 
our ability to grow also depends on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our services and the amount these advertisers spend on our services 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our ability to grow and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of phone calls or click throughs which will be delivered to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per phone call or click through 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets 
in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of mobile and internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  mobile and internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
additionally  the current business environment has generally resulted in advertisers and reseller partners reducing advertising and marketing services budgets or changing such budgets throughout the year  which we expect will impact our quarterly results of operations in addition to the typical seasonality seen in our industry 
service costs our service costs represent the cost of providing our performance based advertising services and our search marketing services 
the service costs that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include user acquisition costs  amortization of intangible assets  license and content fees  credit card processing fees  network operations  serving our search results  telecommunication costs  including the use of phone numbers relating to our call products and services  
table of contents maintaining our web sites  domain name registration renewal fees  network fees  fees paid to outside service providers  delivering customer service  depreciation of our web sites  network equipment and internally developed software  colocation service charges of our network web site equipment  bandwidth and software license fees  payroll and related expenses of related personnel  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
user acquisition costs for the periods presented the largest component of our service costs consist of user acquisition costs that relate primarily to payments made to distribution partners for access to their mobile  online  offline  or other user traffic 
we enter into agreements of varying durations with distribution partners that integrate our services into their web sites and indexes 
the primary economic structure of the distribution partner agreements is a variable payment based on a specified percentage of revenue 
fixed payments  based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered  variable payments based on a specified metric  such as number of paid phone calls or click throughs  and a combination arrangement with both fixed and variable amounts that may be paid in advance 
we expense user acquisition costs based on whether the agreement provides for fixed or variable payments 
agreements with fixed payments with minimum guaranteed amounts of usage are expensed as the greater of the pro rata amount over the term of arrangement or the actual usage delivered to date based on the contractual revenue share 
agreements with variable payments based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid phone calls  click throughs or other metrics are expensed as incurred based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  advertising and promotional expenditures including online and outside marketing activities  cost of systems used to sell to and serve advertisers  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
product development product development costs consist primarily of expenses incurred in the research and development  creation and enhancement of our web sites and services 
our research and development expenses include payroll and related expenses for personnel  costs of computer hardware and software  
table of contents costs incurred in developing features and functionality of the services we offer  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
for the periods presented  substantially all of our product development expenses are research and development 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with fasb asc this statement requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  including accounting  legal and insurance  bad debt provisions  facilities costs  other general corporate expenses  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the fair value method 
as a result  stock based compensation consists of the following all share based compensation arrangements granted after january  adoption date of fasb asc and for any such arrangements that are modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date  and the portion of previous share based awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of january  stock based compensation expense has been included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the consolidated statement of operations 
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill relates to intangible assets identified in connection with our acquisitions 
the intangible assets have been identified as non competition agreements  trademarks and internet domain names  distributor relationships  advertising relationships  patents  and acquired technology 
these assets are amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 

table of contents provision for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance may result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance  existing deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state  city  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
the majority of our deferred tax assets are from goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  we expect to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangibles assets  certain other temporary differences  acquired federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  and research and development credits 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state  city  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state  city  and foreign jurisdictions will be realizable and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions and the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards nol of million excluding jingle which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be available 
accordingly  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset for these nol s 

table of contents in connection with the jingle acquisition  the company acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards nol 
where there is a change in ownership within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  the acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation 
the company believes that such an ownership change had occurred at jingle  and that the utilization of the carryforwards is limited such that the majority of the nol carryforwards will never be utilized 
accordingly  the company has not recorded those amounts the company believes it will not be able to utilize and has not included those nol carryforwards in its deferred tax assets 
the company s preliminary estimate of nol carryforwards that may be utilized is approximately million 
in  the company utilized approximately million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  
revenue 
the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  for the periods presented years ended december  partner and other revenue sources proprietary web site traffic sources total revenue to our partner network revenues are primarily generated using third party distribution networks to deliver the pay for call and per per click advertisers listings 
the distribution network includes mobile and online search engine applications  directories  destination sites  shopping engines  third party internet domains or web sites  other targeted web based content  mobile carriers  and offline sources 
we generate revenue upon delivery of qualified and reported phone calls or click throughs to our advertisers or to advertising services providers listings 
we pay a revenue share to the distribution partners to access their mobile  online  offline or other user traffic 
other revenues include our call provisioning and call tracking services  presence management services  campaign management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
our proprietary web site traffic revenues are generated from our portfolio of owned web sites which are monetized with pay for call or pay per click listings that are relevant to the web sites  as well as other forms of advertising  including banner advertising 
when an online user navigates to one of our web sites and calls or clicks on a particular listing or completes the specified action  we receive a fee 
revenue increased from million for compared to million in the partner and other revenues increased million due almost entirely to increased revenues from our call advertising services  which includes approximately million indirectly attributable to the pre existing customers from the jingle acquisition  and small business solutions products which in part was driven by adding tens of thousands of national and small business accounts across our call advertising services and small business solutions product platforms and certain pricing reductions and incentives provided to at t in we estimated these incentives in comparison to the prior pricing arrangement likely generated an estimated million in savings to at t during this increase was offset by an  decrease in revenue from our pay per click services 
our proprietary web site traffic revenues decreased million and were primarily a result of decreased revenues for cost per actions from resellers related to our local search and directory web sites 
in the near term  we expect lower proprietary web site traffic revenues as a result of lower budgets for cost per actions from resellers particularly related to our local search and directory web sites 

table of contents to revenue was million for compared to million in the partner and other revenues increased million and were affected primarily by increased revenues of million in our call advertising services  which in part was driven by adding more than  national and small business accounts to our platform across our small business solutions products and call advertising services 
this increase was offset by a decrease in revenue from at t from pricing reductions and incentives as part of an extension of our arrangement with at t in the second quarter of along with a decrease in revenue of million generated from our feed management and related services 
effective december  yahoo discontinued its feed management service relationship with us as a result of its recently announced partnership with microsoft 
accordingly  we discontinued our feed management service offering as of that date 
under our primary arrangement with at t  we generate revenues from our small business solutions products to sell call advertising and or search marketing products through their existing sales channels  which are then fulfilled by us across our distribution network 
we are paid account fees and also agency fees for our products in the form of a percentage of the cost of every call or click delivered to their advertisers 
in the second quarter of  we signed an extension of our arrangement with at t through june  that includes certain exclusivity provisions for new advertiser accounts and the contemplated migration of several thousand existing advertiser accounts 
as part of the arrangement  we provided pricing reductions including significant pricing incentives in we estimated these incentives in comparison to the prior arrangement pricing likely generated an estimated million in savings for at t during our proprietary web site traffic revenue decreased primarily due to million in lower revenues for cost per actions from resellers such as dex one corporation  whitepages  inc and intelius  inc  particularly related to our local search and directory web sites 
the remainder of such decrease was largely due to lower revenues from our arrangement with yahoo whereby we receive payment upon click throughs on pay per click listings presented on our web sites 
this decrease was principally due to fewer click throughs on pay per click listings from yahoo through the third quarter of and the expiration of our paid listings arrangement with yahoo related to our web sites on september   although we expect to continue various other contractual arrangements with yahoo 
we entered into a paid listings arrangement with another advertiser service provider in the fourth quarter of which primarily offset yahoo s revenue decline in such quarter 
our ability to maintain and grow our revenues will depend in part on maintaining and increasing the number of phone calls and click throughs performed by users of our service through our distribution partners and proprietary web site traffic sources and maintaining and increasing the number and volume of transactions and favorable variable payment terms with advertisers and advertising services providers  which we believe is dependent in part on marketing our web sites and delivering high quality traffic that ultimately results in purchases or conversions for our advertisers and advertising services providers 
we may increase our direct monetization of our proprietary web site traffic sources which may not be at the same rate levels as other advertising providers and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
if revenue grows and the volume of transactions and traffic increases  we will need to expand our network infrastructure 
inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our growth rate and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of phone calls and click throughs which will be delivered to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per phone call or click through 
it is also difficult to anticipate the impact of worldwide economic conditions on advertising budgets 
in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in 
table of contents levels of mobile and internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  mobile and internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
expenses expenses were as follows in thousands twelve months ended december  revenue revenue revenue service costs sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions acquisition related costs we follow fasb asc and record stock based compensation expense under the fair value method 
in  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense as compared to million in and million in this stock based compensation expense has been included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense categories as follows in thousands twelve months ended december  service costs sales and marketing product development general and administrative total stock based compensation see note b stock option plan of the consolidated financial statements as well as our critical accounting policies for additional information about stock based compensation 
service costs 
service costs increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in distribution partner payments  fees paid to outside service providers  personnel costs  stock based compensation  facility costs  communication and network costs  travel  and depreciation totaling million  partially offset primarily by a decrease in internet domain amortization of  these increases are also related to the incremental revenues as a result of the jingle acquisition and the related operating activities

payments to pay for call  pay per click  and cost per action partners account for higher user acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
we expect that user acquisition costs and revenue shares to distribution partners are likely to increase prospectively given the competitive landscape for distribution partners 
to the extent that payments to pay for call  pay per click or cost per action distribution partners make up a larger percentage of future operations  or the addition or renewal of existing distribution partner agreements are on terms less favorable to us  we expect that service costs will increase as a percentage of revenue 
to the extent of revenue declines in these areas  we expect revenue shares to distribution partners to decrease in absolute dollars 
our proprietary web site traffic revenues have a lower service cost as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
our proprietary web site traffic revenues have no corresponding distribution partner payments 
to the extent our proprietary web site traffic revenues make up a larger percentage of our future operations  we expect that service costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue 
we expect with an increase in the proportion of partner and other revenue sources and additional investment in our network  service costs will increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term 
we also expect that in the longer term service costs will increase in absolute dollars as a result of costs associated with the expansion of our operations and network infrastructure as we scale and adapt to increases in the volume of transactions and traffic and invest in our platforms 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were and for and  respectively 
the net increase in dollars was related primarily to increases in personnel and stock based compensation costs related to the jingle acquisition partially offset by a decrease in online and outside marketing activities 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in sales and marketing expenses was primarily a result of revenues increasing at a greater rate when compared to the increase in sales and marketing expenses 
we expect some volatility in sales and marketing expenses based on the timing of marketing initiatives but expect sales and marketing expenses in the near term to be relatively similar in absolute dollars 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in connection with any revenue increase to the extent that we also increase our marketing activities and correspondingly could increase as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses were and for and  respectively 
the net decrease in dollars and percentage of revenue was related primarily to a decrease in online and outside marketing activities and stock based compensation

we expect product development 
table of contents expenditures in the near term to be relatively stable in absolute dollars 
in the longer term  we expect that product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings and as a result of additional stock based compensation expense 
product development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in dollars was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and stock based compensation of million 
as a percentage of revenue  product development expenses were and in and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in product development expense as compared to was primarily a result of an increase in the proportion of personnel costs and stock based compensation relative to revenue

as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of revenues increasing at a greater rate when compared to the general and administrative expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable in the near term 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the longer term to the extent that we expand our operations and incur additional costs in connection with being a public company  including expenses related to professional fees and insurance  and as a result of stock based compensation expense 
we also expect fluctuations in our general and administrative expenses to the extent the recognition timing of stock based compensation is impacted by market conditions relating to our stock price 
general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in the increase in dollars was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation  personnel costs  fees paid to outside service providers  and bad debt expense of million offset by a decrease in facility and other operating costs of  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions 
intangible amortization expense increased from million in to million in the increase was associated with amortization of intangible assets acquired in the jingle acquisition in april offset partially by certain intangible assets from prior acquisitions being fully amortized 
during  the amortization of intangibles related to service costs  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
intangible amortization expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was associated with certain intangible assets from acquisitions being fully amortized 
during  the amortization of intangibles related to service costs 
our purchase accounting resulted in all assets and liabilities from our acquisitions being recorded at their estimated fair values on their respective acquisition dates 
all goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and liabilities resulting from our acquisitions have been recorded in our financial statements 
the identified intangible assets acquired in the jingle acquisition are million and are being amortized over a range of useful lives of to months 
events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of amortizable intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in the company s stock price and or market capitalization for a sustained period of time 
no impairment of the company s intangible assets have been identified in the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions 
to the extent that changes in the current business environment impact 
table of contents the company s ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  or should other events occur indicating the remaining carrying value of our assets might be impaired  the company would test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an additional impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such assets fair values 
acquisition related costs 
acquisition related costs of million were primarily for professional fees to perform due diligence  historical audits in connection with regulatory filings and other procedures associated with our acquisition of jingle in april of the million of acquisition related costs  we recognized approximately  for the future obligations of non cancelable lease and other costs related to the jingle office 
the portion related to the non cancelable lease is based on estimates of vacancy period and sublease income 
the actual vacancy periods may differ from these estimates  and sublease income  if any  may not materialize 
accordingly  these estimates may be adjusted in future periods 
gain on sales and disposals of intangible assets  net 
the gain on sales and disposals of intangible assets  net was million in and was attributable to the sales and disposals of internet domain names and other intangible assets 
the gain on sales and disposals of intangible assets  net was million and million in and  respectively

during  and  we recognized excess tax benefits deficits on stock option exercises  restricted stock vesting  and dividends paid on unvested restricted stock of approximately million   and  respectively  which were recorded to additional paid in capital 
net income loss 
net income loss increased from a net loss of million in to net income of million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and gains on sales of intangible assets  offset partially by operating costs increases and acquisition related costs of million for in which there were no comparable costs in income tax expense of million recorded in further offset the increase in revenues 
the jingle acquisition also resulted in increased revenues and operating costs 

table of contents net loss increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit of million in compared to  in the increase was also a result of operating cost increases in distribution partner payments  communication and network costs  personnel costs and stock based compensation  and revenue impacts due to pricing reductions and incentives to at t 
this was offset by lower online and outside marketing costs and higher gain on sales and disposals of intangible assets

with respect to a significant portion of our pay for call and pay per click advertising services  the amount payable to the distribution partners will be calculated at the end of a calendar month  with a payment period following the delivery of the phone calls or click throughs 
we generally receive payment from advertisers in close proximity or in some cases prior to the timing of the corresponding payments to the distribution partners who provide placement for the listings 
these services constituted the majority of revenue in  and in certain cases  payments to distribution partners are paid in advance or are fixed in advance based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered 
we have no corresponding payments to distribution partners related to our proprietary web site traffic revenues 
nearly all of the reseller partner arrangements are billed on a monthly basis following the month of our phone call or click through delivery 
this payment structure results in our advancement of monies to the distribution partners who have provided the corresponding placements of the listings 
for these services  reseller partner payments are generally received two to four weeks following payment to the distribution partners 
we expect that in the future periods  if the amounts from our reseller partner arrangements account for a greater percentage of our operating activity  working capital requirements will increase as a result 
we have payment arrangements with reseller partners particularly related to our proprietary web site traffic sources or our small business solutions products  such as at t  supermedia inc  yellowbook usa inc  the cobalt group  and yellow media inc  whereby we receive payment between and days following the delivery of services 
for the year and as of december  amounts from these partners totaled of revenue and million in accounts receivable 
based on the timing of payments  we generally have this level 
table of contents of amounts in outstanding accounts receivable at any given time from these partners 
there can be no assurances that these partners or other advertisers will not experience further financial difficulty  curtail operations  reduce or eliminate spend budgets  delay payments or otherwise forfeit balances owed 
net accounts receivable balances outstanding at december  from at t totaled million 
supermedia and dex one and its subsidiaries consummated reorganizations under chapter of the us bankruptcy code during supermedia and dex one accounted for million and million of revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  we did not recognize an aggregate of million in revenue related to services delivered to supermedia and dex one for the year ended december  in light of collectability considerations and we did not recognize such amounts in based on the terms of their plans of reorganization 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the cash paid at closing of million related to the jingle acquisition  and purchases for property and equipment of million which were partially offset by proceeds from the sales of intangible assets of approximately million 
in april  we acquired jingle in which million  net of cash acquired  was paid at closing 
the acquisition includes deferred acquisition payments of million and million to be paid in cash or shares of class b common stock or a combination of both at the marchex s option on the th and th month anniversaries of closing

cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to proceeds from the sales of intangible assets of approximately million primarily offset by net purchases for property and equipment of million 
we expect property and equipment purchases will increase as we continue to invest in equipment and software 
to the extent our operations increase  we expect to increase expenditures for our systems and personnel 
we expect our expenditures for product development initiatives and internally developed software will increase in the longer term in absolute dollars as our development activities accelerate and we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the repurchase of  shares of class b common stock for treasury stock totaling approximately million and common stock dividend payments of million  partially offset by net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of stock through employee stock options and employee stock plan purchases and million from excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the repurchase of million shares of class b common stock for treasury stock totaling approximately million and common stock dividend payments of million offset by net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of stock through employee stock options and employee stock plan purchases and  of excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
in thousands total less than year years years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases other contractual obligations  total contractual obligations  in february we entered into a license agreement with an advertising partner which provides for a contingent royalty based on a discounted rate of under certain circumstances of certain of our gross revenues payable on a quarterly basis through december the royalty payment is recognized as incurred in service costs and is not included in the above schedule 
our tax contingencies of approximately  are not included due to their uncertainty 
includes deferred acquisition payments of million and million to be paid in cash or shares of class b common stock or a combination of both option on the th and th month anniversaries of closing related to the jingle acquisition 
any deferred acquisition payments paid in shares will be increased by 
these deferred acquisition payments are recorded on the balance sheet as short term liabilities 
we anticipate that we will need to invest working capital towards the development and expansion of our overall operations 
we may also make a significant number of acquisitions  which could result in the reduction of our cash balances or the incurrence of debt 
furthermore  we expect that capital expenditures may increase in future periods  particularly if our operating activity increases 
we are evaluating potential strategic alternatives for certain assets including certain pay per click products and web sites  with a goal of further focusing on the products and opportunities that can drive business growth 
this evaluation may lead to divestures  which may result in cash proceeds in the near term but could also impact future operating cash flows 
on april   we entered into a three year credit agreement which provides us with a million senior secured revolving credit line  which may be used for various corporate purposes including financing permitted acquisitions  subject to compliance with applicable covenants 
during the first quarter of  we signed an amendment to the credit agreement which extended the maturity period through to april  and increases the applicable margin rate by basis points 
as of december   we had million of availability under the credit agreement 
in november  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our class b common stock as well as the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend for the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock 
during and  our board of directors authorized various increase in the share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously purchased under the share repurchase program 
in december  our board of directors authorized an increase in the share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of our class b common stock 
under the share repurchase program  repurchases may take place in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions and at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability  and other market conditions 
this share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be expanded  limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
during the year ended december  and  approximately million and  shares of class b common stock  respectively  were repurchased under the share purchase program 
in  we have repurchased approximately  shares of class b common stock to date 
the quarterly cash dividend was initiated at per share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
for  quarterly dividends were paid on february  may  august and november to class a 
table of contents and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business of february  may  august and november  respectively 
total dividends paid in were approximately million 
for  quarterly dividends were paid on february  may  august and november to class a and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business of february  may  august and november  respectively 
total dividends paid in were approximately million 
although we expect that the annual cash dividend  subject to capital availability  will be per common share or approximately million for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at such a rate or at all 
under delaware law  dividends to stockholders may be made only from the surplus of a company  or  in certain situations  from the net profits for the current fiscal year before the dividend is declared by the board of directors 
on may   a registration statement on form s file no 
relating to the resale of  shares of our class b common stock by certain selling stockholders with s registration rights granted in connection with the jingle acquisition was filed the sec 
this registration statement on form s was declared effective by the sec on august  we will not receive any proceeds in connection with these sales by selling stockholders 
based on our operating plans we believe that our existing credit availability  resources and cash flow provided by ongoing operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months 
additional equity and debt financing may be needed to support our acquisition strategy  our long term obligations and our company s needs 
if additional financing is necessary  it may not be available  and if it is available  it may not be possible for us to obtain financing on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies the policies below are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies relate to the following matters and are described below revenue  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits  and provision for income taxes 
revenue we currently generate revenue through our operating businesses by delivering call and click based advertising products that enable advertisers of all sizes to reach consumers across online  mobile and offline sources 
the primary revenue driver has been performance based advertising  which includes pay for call 
table of contents advertising  pay per click advertising  and cost per action services 
for pay for call and pay per click advertising  revenue is recognized upon delivery of qualified and reported phone calls or click throughs to our advertisers or advertising service providers listing which occurs when an online  mobile or offline user makes a phone call or clicks on any of their advertisements after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each phone call or click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
for cost per action services  revenue is recognized when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
we have entered into agreements with various distribution partners in order to expand our distribution network  which includes mobile and online search engines and applications  directories  shopping engines  third party internet domains or web sites  other targeted web based content  offline sources  and our portfolio of owned web sites  on which we include our advertisers listings 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a specified percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per phone call or click through on these listings 
we act as the primary obligor in these transactions  and we are responsible for providing customer and administrative services to the advertiser 
in accordance with fasb asc  the revenue derived from advertisers who receive paid introductions through us as supplied by distribution partners is reported gross based upon the amounts received from the advertiser 
we also recognize revenue for certain agency contracts with advertisers under the net revenue recognition method 
under these specific agreements  we purchase listings on behalf of advertisers from search engines and directories 
we are paid account fees and also agency fees based on the total amount of the purchase made on behalf of these advertisers 
under these agreements  our advertisers are primarily responsible for choosing the publisher and determining pricing  and the company  in certain instances  is only financially liable to the publisher for the amount collected from our advertisers 
this creates a sequential liability for media purchases made on behalf of advertisers 
in certain instances  the web publishers engage the advertisers directly and we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
in limited arrangements resellers pay us a fee for fulfilling an advertiser s campaign in our distribution network and we act as the primary obligor 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the gross revenue recognition method 
we apply fasb asc to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
fasb asc addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
when an arrangement involves multiple elements  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we apply the provisions of fasb asc goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc fasb asc also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with fasb asc goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
events and circumstances considered in determining whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price and or market 
table of contents capitalization for a sustained period of time 
if our stock price were to trade below book value per share for a extended period of time and or we continue to experience adverse effects of a continued downward trend in the overall economic environment  changes in the business itself  including changes in projected earnings and cash flows  we may have to recognize an impairment of all or some portion of our goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  a material impairment charge may be reported in our financial results 
we exercise judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives of intangible assets  the fair values and the recoverability 
in certain instances  the fair value is determined in part based on cash flow forecasts and discount rate estimates 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of intangible assets are different than originally estimated  the amortization period is reduced or extended and  accordingly  amortization expense is increased or decreased 
recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment is to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
no impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets have been identified in  or the current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions 
to the extent that changes in the current business environment impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  or should other events occur indicating the remaining carrying value of our assets might be impaired  we would test our intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an additional impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such asset s fair value 
any future additional impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation fasb asc requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock based awards made to employees  non employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock issuances  and restricted stock units based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period 
we generally use the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock based awards with time based vesting 
our determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected life of the award  our expected stock price  volatility over the term of the award and actual and projected exercise behaviors 
for stock based awards with time based vesting  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
during  we issued equity awards of stock options and restricted stock units in three separate tranches that have vesting based on a combination of certain service and market conditions 
for equity awards with 
table of contents vesting based on a combination of certain service and market conditions  we factor an estimated probability of achieving certain service and market conditions and recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period of the award 
we used a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value for each tranche and a monte carlo simulation to determine the derived service period for each tranche 
although the fair value of stock based awards is determined in accordance with fasb asc  the assumptions used in calculating fair value of stock based awards  the use of the black scholes option pricing model  and the use of the binomial lattice model and a monte carlo simulation are highly subjective  and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note b stock option plan in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits accounts receivable balances are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable 
we determine our allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts  advertiser concentrations  advertiser creditworthiness and current economic trends 
we review the allowance for collectability on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote 
if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required which would result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination was made 
we determine our allowance for advertiser credits and adjustments based upon our analysis of historical credits 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates 
provision for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
each reporting period we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income  and to the extent that realization is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance may result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on operating performance  existing deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state  city  and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates  projected revenues and expenses  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our other assets 
the majority of our deferred tax assets are from goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with various acquisitions that are tax deductible over year periods 
based on projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  we expect to be able to recover these assets 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered 
table of contents realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
fasb asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the our tax return 
fasb asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
as of december   we have net deferred tax assets of million  relating to the impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangibles assets  certain other temporary differences  acquired federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  and research and development credits 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
as of december   based upon both positive and negative evidence available  we have determined it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets primarily relating to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state  city and foreign jurisdictions will be realizable and accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance of million against these deferred tax assets 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions and the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
should we determine in the future that we will be able to realize these deferred tax assets  or not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets recorded as of december   an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would impact net income or stockholders equity in the period such determination was made

we place our investments with high quality financial institutions 
during the years ended december  and  the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings were not material

currently  we have no borrowings under this facility  however  an increase in interest rates would impact interest expense on future borrowings
