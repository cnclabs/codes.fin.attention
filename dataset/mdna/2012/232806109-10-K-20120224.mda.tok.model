critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and the data used to prepare them 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements under item describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition  
table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and financial instruments  stock based compensation  litigation and settlement costs  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition we generate revenues by selling products to distributors  various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing service providers emss 
we recognize revenue on sales to oems and emss provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection  other allowances and stock rotation under certain circumstances 
given the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors  revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers 
revenues are recognized from those distributors when the products have been sold to the end customers 
reported information includes product resale price  quantity and end customer shipment information as well as remaining inventory on hand 
at the time of shipment to those distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment  relieve inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors  and defer the related margin as deferred margin on sales to distributors in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers 
we record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns  price protection and allowances  based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts 
we also provide certain distributors and emss with volume pricing discounts  such as rebates and incentives  which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale 
historically these volume discounts have not been significant 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary materially from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience  specific customer creditworthiness  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected 
valuation of inventories management periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves 
we record a write down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we 
table of contents perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to record additional write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived assets our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand 
in addition  we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis 
if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges on our long lived assets 
valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill impairment exists when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the carrying amount of goodwill at january  was million in the consumer and computation division ccd and was unchanged from the balance at january  ccd is the only reportable business segment with goodwill 
we assess our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and  if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  on an interim basis 
in september  the fasb issued asu testing goodwill for impairment asc topic that was intended to reduce the complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the issuance of asu provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
we adopted asu in fiscal the fair value of ccd was substantially in excess of its carrying amount based on the quantitative assessment of goodwill that we performed in fiscal there have been no triggering events or changes in circumstances since that quantitative analysis to indicate that the fair value of ccd would be less than its carrying amount 
we performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill in fiscal and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of ccd exceeded its carrying amount 
in assessing the qualitative factors  we considered the impact of these key factors i change in the industry and competitive environment  ii market capitalization  iii stock price  and iv overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods 
based on the foregoing  the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test were unnecessary for fiscal and goodwill was not impaired as of january  no goodwill impairment was recognized in fiscal  and because the fair value of ccd was more than its carrying value in those years 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance generally include available for sale investments  employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives 
the guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
as such  fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level includes instruments for which quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
our financial assets utilizing level inputs include us treasuries  money market funds  marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan 
level includes instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level assets consist of certain marketable debt instruments for which values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
our level instruments include certain us government securities  commercial paper and corporate notes and bonds 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
financial assets utilizing level inputs primarily include auction rate securities 
we use an income approach valuation model to estimate the exit price of the auction rate securities  which is derived as the weighted average present value of expected cash flows over various periods of illiquidity  using a risk adjusted discount rate that is based on the credit risk and liquidity risk of the securities 
availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and to the extent that valuation is based on inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by our management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in regards to our auction rate securities  the income approach valuation model was based on both level credit quality and interest rates and level inputs 
we determined that the level inputs were the most significant to the overall fair value measurement  particularly the estimates of risk adjusted discount rates and ranges of expected periods of illiquidity 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we 
table of contents are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our future stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
accounting for income taxes our global operations involve manufacturing  research and development and selling activities 
profits from non us activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to us tax until repatriated to the us it is our intention to permanently reinvest these earnings outside the us we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our investment portfolio consists of a variety of financial instruments that exposes us to interest rate risk  including  but not limited to  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate securities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheets at fair market value with their related unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate and sell products in various global markets and purchase capital equipment using foreign currencies but predominantly the us dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar may adversely affect our operating margins 
for example  when foreign currencies appreciate against the us dollar  inventory and expenses denominated in foreign currencies become more expensive 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for international customers  thus potentially leading to a reduction in demand  and therefore in our sales and profitability 
furthermore  many of our competitors are foreign companies that could benefit from such a currency fluctuation  making it more difficult for us to compete with those companies 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business and results of operations 
we analyzed our foreign currency exposure  including our hedging strategies  to identify assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies 
for those assets and liabilities  we evaluated the effects of a shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar 
we have determined that there would be an immaterial effect on our results of operations from such a shift
