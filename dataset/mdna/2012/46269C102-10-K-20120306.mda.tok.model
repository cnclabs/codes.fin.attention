background we were initially formed in as ghl acquisition corp  a special purpose acquisition company 
we acquired all the outstanding equity in iridium holdings llc  or iridium holdings  in a transaction accounted for as a business combination on september  we refer to this transaction as the acquisition 
we refer to iridium holdings  together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries  as iridium 
in accounting for the acquisition  ghl acquisition corp 
was deemed the legal and accounting acquirer and iridium the legal and accounting acquiree 
on september   we changed our name to iridium communications inc overview of our business we are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites 
we are the second largest provider of satellite based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue  and the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage 
our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where existing wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are impaired  including extremely remote or rural land areas  airways  open ocean  the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters 
we provide voice and data communications services to businesses  the us and foreign governments  non governmental organizations and consumers using our constellation of in orbit satellites and related ground infrastructure 
we utilize an interlinked  mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks 
this unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation  which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence 
we sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network  encompassing approximately service providers  value added resellers  or vars  and value added manufacturers  who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers  vars or dealers 
these distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific vertical markets 
at december   we had approximately  billable subscribers worldwide  an increase of  or from approximately  billable subscribers at december  we have a diverse customer base  including end users in the following vertical markets land based handset  maritime  aviation  machine to machine  or mm  and government 
we recognize revenue from both the sale of equipment and the provision of services 
we expect a higher proportion of our future revenue will be derived from services 
voice and mm data service revenue have historically generated higher gross margins than subscriber equipment revenue 
we are currently devoting a substantial part of our resources to develop iridium next  our next generation satellite constellation  along with the development of new product and service offerings  upgrades to our current services  hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure and upgrades to our business systems 
we estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through to be approximately billion 
we believe our credit facility  described below  together with internally generated cash flow  including potential cash flows from hosted payloads and the proceeds from our outstanding stock purchase warrants  will be sufficient to fully fund the aggregate costs associated with the design  build and launch of iridium next and related ground infrastructure upgrades through for more information about our sources of funding  see liquidity and capital resources 
full scale development and launch services agreements in june  we executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract  or fsd  with thales alenia space france  or thales  for the design and manufacture of satellites for iridium next 
the total price under the fsd will be approximately billion  and we expect our payment obligations under the fsd to extend into the third quarter of as of december   we had made total payments of million to thales  which were classified within property and equipment  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in march  we entered into an agreement with space exploration technologies corp  or spacex  to secure spacex as the primary launch services provider for iridium next  which we refer to as the spacex agreement 
the spacex agreement  as amended  has a maximum price of million for eight launches  each of which can carry nine satellites 
as of december   we had made total payments of million to spacex  which were classified within property and equipment  net  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents in june  we entered into an agreement with international space company kosmotras  or kosmotras  as a supplemental launch services provider for iridium next 
the agreement provides for the purchase of up to six launches and six additional launch options 
each launch can carry two satellites 
if we purchase all six launches  we will pay kosmotras a total of approximately million 
if we do not purchase any launches by march   the agreement will terminate  and our payments to kosmotras  including in respect of pre launch development work  non recurring milestone payments already completed at that time and termination fees  would be approximately million 
as of december   we had made aggregate payments of million to kosmotras which were capitalized as construction in progress within property and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
credit facility on october   we entered into a billion loan facility  or the credit facility  with a syndicate of bank lenders 
ninety five percent of our obligations under the credit facility are insured by compagnie fran aise d assurance pour le commerce ext rieur  or coface

we also pay a commitment fee of per year  in semi annual installments  on any undrawn portion of the credit facility 
funds drawn under the credit facility will be used for i of the costs under the fsd for the design and manufacture of iridium next  ii the premium for the coface insurance and iii the payment of a portion of interest during a portion of the construction and launch phase of iridium next 
scheduled semi annual principal repayments will begin six months after the earlier of i the successful deployment of a specified number of iridium next satellites or ii september  during this repayment period  interest will be paid on the same date as the principal repayments 
prior to the repayment period  interest payments are due on a semi annual basis in april and october 
interest expense incurred during the year ended december  was million

material trends and uncertainties iridium s industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services  increased demand for communications services by the department of defense  or dod  disaster and relief agencies and emergency first responders  a broad and expanding wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets  a growing number of new products and services and related applications  improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings  regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services  a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment  and geographic market expansion through the receipt of licenses in additional countries 
as we continue the iridium business  we face a number of challenges and uncertainties  including our ability to develop iridium next and related ground infrastructure  and to develop products and services for iridium next  including our ability to continue to access the credit facility to meet our future capital requirements for the design  build  and launch of the iridium next satellites  
table of contents our ability to obtain sufficient internally generated cash flows  including cash flows from hosted payloads and proceeds from our outstanding stock purchase warrants  to fund a portion of the costs associated with iridium next and support ongoing business  our ability to maintain the health  capacity  control and level of service of our existing satellite network through the transition to iridium next  changes in general economic  business and industry conditions  our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center  competition from other mobile satellite service providers and  to a lesser extent  from the expansion of terrestrial based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures  our ability to maintain our relationship with us government customers  particularly the dod  market acceptance of our products  regulatory requirements  in existing and new geographic markets  rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry  reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products  services and applications effectively  reliance on single source suppliers for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand  natural disasters or other events  and reliance on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  where the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  useful lives of property and equipment  long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation  warranty expenses and other estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
