overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in countries and territories  including the us  and distribute products in more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in five regions latin america  north america  central eastern europe  western europe  middle east africa  and asia pacific 
we have centralized operations for global brand marketing  global sales and supply chain 
our product categories are beauty  fashion and home 
beauty consists of color cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and personal care 
fashion consists of fashion jewelry  watches  apparel  footwear  accessories and children s products 
home consists of gift and decorative products  housewares  entertainment and leisure products and nutritional products 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by approximately million active independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not our employees 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  retaining and servicing our representatives 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the us total revenue in increased  with favorable foreign exchange contributing points to the revenue increase 
constant revenues increased 
active representatives decreased 
sales from products in the beauty category increased  or on a constant basis  due to a increase in net per unit offset by a decrease in units 
we saw slower than expected growth in several markets partially attributable to weaker macro economic conditions 
in brazil  our largest market  lower than normal service levels were further impacted by the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system during the second half of the year  which weakened results 
additionally  slowing beauty category market growth pressured brazil s results in the second half of during the latter part of  we believe russia s performance was also impacted by weak trends in the beauty category market in that country 
see the segment review section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment 
during  our operating margin was negatively impacted by an impairment charge of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset associated with our silpada business unit which we acquired during as a result of this impairment charge  operating profit for was negatively impacted by please refer to note  goodwill and intangible assets  of our annual report for a discussion regarding silpada 
we continue to experience increases in labor and commodity costs  including oil  silver and cotton 
our pricing strategies are helping to partially offset the resulting product cost increases but there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately 
in  we committed to undertake a detailed assessment of our long range business plan in order to improve our performance and better position ourselves in the increasingly complex economic environment 
the review will include internal and external inputs  executional capabilities and capital allocation 
we believe that our operating cash flow and global cash and cash equivalent balances will allow us to continue our focus on long term sustainable  profitable growth 
we are also focused on innovating our direct selling channel through technological and service model enhancements for our representatives 
beginning in the first quarter of  the results of asia pacific and china were managed as a single operating segment  referred to as asia pacific 
accordingly  asia pacific amounts include the results of china for all periods presented 
in december  we completed the sale of our subsidiary in japan  which has been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods 
initiatives we continue to implement certain initiatives under our and restructuring programs 
the anticipated savings or benefits realized from these initiatives has funded and will continue to fund our investment in  amongst other things  advertising  market intelligence  consumer research and product innovation 
advertising and representative value proposition rvp we significantly increased spending on advertising over the four years leading up to while investing in advertising remains a key strategy  during our investment in advertising decreased by or and as a percentage of beauty sales  our investment in advertising decreased by compared to the decrease in advertising in is primarily due to the shift to increased investment in rvp 
the advertising investments supported new product launches  such as supershock max mascara 
moisture seduction lipstick  outspoken intense by fergie fragrance  step into fragrance  anew genics treatment cream  anew solar advance sunscreen face lotion spf  solutions youth minerals restorative night cream  super enchant mascara  and extralasting makeup 
advertising investments also included advertising to recruit representatives 
we also continued to build the alliances portfolio including fergie and local celebrities in latin america and russia 
we continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our representatives 
we have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions  and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets 
we have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our representatives 
we measure our investment in rvp as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives 
during  we invested approximately incrementally in our representatives through rvp by continued implementation of our sales leadership program  enhanced incentives  increased sales campaign frequency  improved commissions and new e business tools 
we will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for representatives through various means  including the following evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets  continuing the roll out of our sales leadership program  which offers representatives an enhanced career opportunity  strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance representative economics  recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize representative selling opportunities  service model transformation initiatives  applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets  and web enablement for representatives including on line training enhancements 
while the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses  we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce representative effort worldwide 
we will continue to focus on improving internet based tools for our representatives 
enterprise resource planning system we are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning erp system  which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes 
we began our gradual global roll out in europe in and have since implemented erp in our european manufacturing facilities  our larger european direct selling operations and in the us as part of this continuing global roll out  we expect to implement erp in other countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations 
during  we implemented the supply chain module of erp in brazil 
while the implementation of the erp system and transformation of the related processes negatively impacted service levels in brazil in the second half of  we expect the erp system to help improve our service reliability over the long term 
restructuring initiatives we launched restructuring programs in late restructuring program and in february restructuring program 
through december   we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in  in  in  in  in  in and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
through december   we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in  in  and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
see note  restructuring initiatives  on pages f through f of our annual report for further information on these restructuring programs 
new accounting standards information relating to new accounting standards is included in note  new accounting standards  of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
performance metrics within this md a  in addition to our key financial metrics of revenue  operating profit and operating margin  we utilize the performance metrics defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
performance metrics definition growth in active representatives this metric is based on the number of representatives submitting an order in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the growth in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this metric is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this metric is equal to the number of days of cost of sales  based on the average of the preceding months  covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 
we refer to these adjusted growth rates as constant growth  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends 
to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate 
currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates 
we present gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  operating profit  operating margin and effective tax rate on a non gaap basis 
the discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non gaap basis 
we have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non gaap financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
the company uses the non gaap financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of  on a period to period basis  the impacts of costs to implement cti restructuring initiatives  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment charge related to silpada impairment charge  and costs and charges related to venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency in january venezuelan special items 
the company believes investors find the non gaap information helpful in understanding the ongoing performance of operations separate from items that may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the company s financial results in any particular period 
the impairment charge includes the impact on the statement of income caused by the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment charge related to silpada in the venezuelan special items include the impact on the statement of income caused by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities  such as cash  receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and nonmonetary assets  such as inventory and prepaid expenses 
for nonmonetary assets  the venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of and the revised official exchange rate of 
critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our annual report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record the estimated expense for our restructuring initiatives as such costs are deemed probable and estimable  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority and by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent our best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to us each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances  including selling schedules  business operations  seasonality and changing trends 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense has been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
bad debt expense  as a percent of revenue increased by 
points in as compared to  primarily in latin america 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  sales returns have been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was for  for  and for pension  postretirement and postemployment expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and a portion of employees in international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits subject to certain limitations to the majority of employees in the us and in some foreign countries 
see note  employee benefit plans  to our annual report for further information on our benefit plans 
pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was  compared to for in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and in equity securities and high yield securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan was for the most recent year period and for the year period 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned over the year period and over the year period 
the plan assets in the us returned in and in recently issued regulations under the pension protection act of  though not yet finalized  require that hybrid plans limit the maximum interest crediting rate to one among several choices of crediting rates which are considered market rates of return 
the rate chosen will affect total pension obligations 
the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 
the weighted average discount rate for us and non us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  for the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate  we take into consideration external actuarial advice 
our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions  including discount rates  hybrid plan maximum interest crediting rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above  rate of compensation increase of plan participants  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had pretax actuarial losses  prior service credits  and transition obligations totaling for the us plans and for the us plans that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity 
while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
for  our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is for our us plans and for our us plans 
our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis 
a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had approximately the following effect on pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase decrease rate of return on assets discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
we have recognized deferred tax assets of relating to foreign tax credit carryforwards that will expire between and to the extent future us taxable income is less favorable than currently projected by management  our ability to utilize these foreign tax credits may be affected and a valuation allowance may be required 
deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when we conclude that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
we recognize the benefit of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we file income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in  a number of open tax years are scheduled to close due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if our filing positions are ultimately upheld  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments 
share based compensation stock options issued to employees are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results 
loss contingencies we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  using fair value methods 
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment assessments for during the year end close process and determined that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units  with the exception of our silpada reporting unit 
our analysis of the silpada business indicated an impairment as the carrying value of the business exceeded the estimated fair value 
accordingly  an estimated non cash before tax impairment charge of was recorded in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amounts of goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset 
at december   as a result of the impairment charge recorded  the carrying values of silpada s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset were and  respectively 
following weaker than expected performance in the fourth quarter  we lowered our revenue and earnings projections for silpada largely due to the rise in silver prices  which nearly doubled since the acquisition  and the negative impact of pricing on revenues and margins 
the decline in the fair values of the silpada reporting unit and the underlying trademark was driven by the reduction in the forecasted growth rates and cash flows used to estimate fair value 
the impairment analyses performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets require several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite lived intangible asset 
we use a discounted cash flow dcf approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit  which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business  and is most consistent with the approach a market place participant would use 
the estimation of fair value utilizing a dcf approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates  as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of silpada included the discount rate based on the weighted average cost of capital  revenue growth  silver prices  and representative growth and activity rates 
the fair value of the silpada trademark was determined using a risk adjusted dcf model under the relief from royalty method 
the royalty rate used was based on a consideration of market rates 
a decline in silpada expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the risk adjusted discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in additional impairment charges for the goodwill and the indefinite lived trademark 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  to our annual report for further information on silpada 
for the years ended december  and  we completed our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment assessments and no adjustments were necessary 
additionally  no events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicated that our definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the three years ended december  the impairment analyses performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets require several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of discount rates 
a significant decline in expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in a future impairment charge

fashion growth rates benefited by points from the silpada acquisition 
strong revenue performance during the first half of was offset by a slowdown in revenue growth during the second half of the year 
our second half of revenue growth was negatively impacted by a slowdown in two of our largest markets  brazil and russia 
brazil s moderated performance in the second half of was primarily caused by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products 
the mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which had also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years 
russia s performance in the second half of was primarily a result of slowing field growth due to weak incentives 
increases in social benefit taxes levied against certain representatives exacerbated the slowdown in field growth 
the increased taxes disproportionately reduced new and developing representatives earnings  which reduced their motivation to recruit 
in russia  weaker color and skincare performance negatively impacted growth in the second half of for additional discussion of the changes in revenue by segment  see the segment review section of this md a

additionally  slowing beauty category market growth pressured brazil s results in the second half of while the implementation of the erp system and transformation of the related processes may negatively impact service levels in the short term  we expect the erp system to help improve our service reliability over the long term 
constant revenue growth in mexico during  was driven by an increase in active representatives and a higher average order 
revenue growth during in venezuela was the result of a higher average order primarily due to increased prices  primarily as a result of inflation 
the decrease in adjusted non gaap operating margin during was driven by a sharp decline in brazil s operating margin 
brazil s operating margin was partially unfavorably impacted by inventory related charges primarily due to supply chain challenges  which negatively impacted latin america s operating margin by 
points 
additionally  brazil s decline in operating margin was further caused by business disruptions and resulting investments in that market  as well as inflationary pressure on costs 
adjusted non gaap operating margin in the region during was also negatively impacted by higher bad debt expense and higher distribution costs due to the transition to the new facilities in brazil and colombia 
operating margin during  in latin america was negatively impacted by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency in conjunction with higher inflationary accounting as discussed further below 
effective january   we began to account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure 
the official exchange rate moved from to for essential goods and to for nonessential goods and services 
effective december   the venezuelan government eliminated the rate which had been available for the import of essential goods 
substantially all of the imports of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela fall into the nonessential classification 
as a result of the change in the official rate to in conjunction with accounting for our operations in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting guidelines  during the first quarter of  we recorded net charges of in other expense  net and in income taxes  for a total after tax charge of  reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits 
additionally  certain nonmonetary assets must continue to be carried at us historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation 
therefore  the historic us dollar costs impacted the income statement during at a disproportionate rate as they had not been devalued based on the new exchange rates 
as a result of using the us historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets  such as inventory  acquired prior to the devaluation  operating profit during was negatively impacted by  for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of and the current official exchange rate of 
as there were no further devaluations  there was an immaterial impact on operating profit in from the venezuelan currency devaluations 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have impacted the ability of avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products 
since  avon venezuela had been obtaining its foreign currency needs beyond the amounts that could be obtained at official rates through non government sources where the exchange rates were less favorable than the official rate parallel market 
in late may  the venezuelan government took control over the previously freely traded parallel market 
trading in the parallel market was suspended for several weeks in may and june and reopened as a regulated sitme market in early june the government has imposed volume restrictions on trading activity  limiting an entity s activity to a maximum of per month 
the current limit is below the monthly foreign exchange requirements of our venezuelan operations and  unless these restrictions are modified  may have a negative impact on avon venezuela s future operations 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover the higher cost of obtaining foreign currency in the sitme market as compared to the official rate through operating activities  such as increased pricing or cost reductions in other areas 
at december   we had a net asset position of associated with our operations in venezuela  which included cash balances of approximately of which approximately was denominated in bol vares remeasured at the december  official exchange rate and approximately was denominated in us dollars 
of the net asset position  approximately was associated with bol var denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes 
additionally  during avon venezuela s revenue and operating profit represented approximately of avon s consolidated revenue  of avon s consolidated operating profit  and of avon s non gaap operating profit 
during  the exchange rate in the sitme market ranged within to bol vares to the us dollar  however  as noted previously  access to us dollars in the sitme market is limited 
to illustrate our sensitivity to potential future changes in the official exchange rate in venezuela  if the official exchange rate was further devalued as of december   to a rate of bol vares to the us dollar  or an approximate devaluation  our results would be negatively impacted as follows as a result of the use of a further devalued exchange rate for the remeasurement of avon venezuela s revenues and profits  avon s annualized consolidated revenues would likely be negatively impacted by approximately and annualized consolidated operating profit would likely be negatively impacted by approximately prospectively  assuming s consolidated operating profit without the silpada impairment charge and no operational improvements occurred to offset the negative impact of a further devaluation 
avon s consolidated operating profit during the first twelve months following the devaluation  in this example  would likely be negatively impacted by approximately  assuming no offsetting operational improvements 
the larger negative impact on operating profit during the first twelve months as compared to the prospective impact is caused by costs of nonmonetary assets being carried at historic dollar cost in accordance with the requirement to account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy while revenue would be remeasured at the further devalued rate 
we would likely incur an immediate charge of approximately in other expenses  net and in income taxes associated with the of bol var denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes 
during  costs associated with acquiring goods that required settlement in us dollars through the sitme markets in venezuela included within operating profit were approximately the amounts reported for costs associated with acquiring goods that required settlement in us dollars through the parallel or sitme markets in venezuela included within operating profit during were approximately additionally  if the exchange rate in the sitme market is further devalued  or an alternative source of exchange becomes available at an unfavorable rate beyond the sitme rate of bol vares to the us dollar  our results would be negatively impacted

total revenue during increased as compared to due to growth in active representatives  driven by continued investments in rvp  and a higher average order 
revenue during grew in brazil and in mexico  with benefits from favorable foreign exchange  while the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange drove a revenue decline of in venezuela during constant revenue during benefited from continued growth in most markets  particularly from growth of in brazil  in mexico and in venezuela 
constant revenue growth in mexico during  was driven by an increase in active representatives  as well as an increase in average order 
constant revenue growth for  in venezuela reflected a higher average order primarily due to increased prices  partially as a result of inflation  and growth in active representatives 
constant revenue growth during in brazil was primarily driven by an increase in active representatives 
constant revenue growth in in brazil was pressured by service disruptions in the second half of the year and a decline in skin care sales 
brazil s revenue grew and during the first half and second half of  respectively  with constant growth rates of in the first half and in the second half 
brazil s performance in the second half of was primarily driven by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products 
the mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which have also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years as brazil s growth during this period outpaced our expectations and our planned infrastructure investments 
these factors pressured the capacity of our legacy systems and were the primary cause of the service disruptions 
operating margin declined during in latin america due to the negative impact of the devaluation of the venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting as discussed previously 
the decline in operating margin during caused by the venezuelan special items was partially offset by benefits of 
points from lower cti restructuring 
on an adjusted non gaap basis  excluding the venezuelan special items and cti restructuring  the decrease in operating margin in was primarily driven by higher distribution costs  increased investment in rvp and advertising  partially offset by the benefit of favorable foreign exchange

the total revenue decline for was primarily due to a decline in active representatives 
sales of beauty products decreased during  partly due to weakness in the beauty market 
sales of non beauty products declined during the inclusion of silpada in our results during the unmatched period through july contributed points to non beauty growth rates during in  operating margin in north america was negatively impacted by an impairment charge of silpada goodwill and an indefinite lived intangible asset 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  to our annual report for a discussion regarding silpada 
on an adjusted non gaap basis  excluding the impairment charge and cti restructuring  the decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by lower revenues while continuing to incur overhead expenses that do not vary directly with revenue  increased investment in rvp  and lower gross margin due to commodity cost pressures 
partially offsetting these negative impacts were lower advertising and improved bad debt 
during  operating margin benefited by 
points due to a reduction in the estimated fair value of an earnout provision recorded in connection with the silpada acquisition  as we revised our estimate of the earnout liability to be zero 
in comparison  operating margin during benefited by 
points due to the change in the fair value of the earnout provision from at the date of acquisition to at december  given that our results have been pressured  we have focused on our recovery plan  which has included enhancing our sales leadership model and optimizing our product portfolio 
during the latter portion of the year  there has been positive reaction to our recalibration of the mix of beauty and non beauty products and focus on smart value within beauty  as part of the optimization of our product portfolio

as a result of the silpada acquisition  units sold and active representatives for were each favorably impacted by point 
the total revenue decline during was due to a decline in active representatives and a lower average order received from representatives 
the decline in active representatives for was largely due to a decline in additions compared with s record recruiting 
this resulted in strong growth in active representatives during causing an unfavorable comparison in sales of non beauty products decreased during  with silpada offsetting the decline by points 
sales of beauty products decreased during  partly due to weakness in the beauty market 
the increase in north america operating margin and adjusted non gaap operating margin during was primarily driven by improvements in gross margin caused by favorable pricing and mix and manufacturing productivity gains and the inclusion of silpada results  which benefited operating margin by points during  despite approximately of amortization of intangible assets 
these operating margin benefits were negatively impacted by lower revenues which were not able to offset overhead expenses  despite cost saving initiatives 
the costs associated with completing the silpada acquisition were recorded in global expenses and were not allocated to the north america segment 
included within the silpada results was an operating margin benefit of

russia s revenue grew in the first half of  but was flat during the second half  with constant growth rates of in the first half and in the second half 
russia s performance in the second half of was primarily a result of slowing field growth due to weak incentives 
increases in social benefit taxes levied against certain representatives exacerbated the slowdown in field growth 
the increased taxes disproportionately reduced new and developing representatives earnings  which reduced their motivation to recruit 
in russia  weaker color and skincare performance negatively impacted revenue growth in the second half of during the first quarter of  we launched a new sales leadership compensation plan to help offset the tax burden on these representatives

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by changes in the value of the underlying transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 
interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure 
the interest rate swaps are used to either convert our fixed rate borrowing to a variable interest rate or to unwind an existing variable interest rate swap on a fixed rate borrowing 
at december  and  we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor 
our total exposure to floating interest rates was at december   and at december  our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
foreign currency risk we conduct business globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the euro  mexican peso  philippine peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  south africa rand  turkish lira  ukrainian hryvnia and venezuelan bol var 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates
