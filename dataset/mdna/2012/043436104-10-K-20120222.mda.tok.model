item business we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises dealership locations as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  
table of contents vehicle maintenance  replacement parts and collision repair services  new and used vehicle financing  and aftermarket products such as insurance  warranty and service contracts 
asbury automotive group  inc was incorporated in the state of delaware on february   and our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol abg 
general description of our operations as of december   we operated dealerships in metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
we have developed our dealership portfolio through the acquisition of large  locally branded dealership groups operating throughout the united states 
we have complemented these large dealership group acquisitions with the purchase of numerous single point dealerships and smaller dealership groups in and surrounding our then existing market areas 
our retail network is made of up dealerships operating primarily under eight locally branded dealership groups

our operations provide a diverse revenue base that we believe mitigates the impact of fluctuating new vehicle sales volumes and our broad geographic footprint  as well as diversification among manufacturers  decrease our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
while new vehicle sales generate the majority of our revenue  used vehicle retail sales  parts and service and finance and insurance provide significantly 
table of contents higher profit margins  and therefore account for the majority of our profitability and have been historically more stable throughout economic cycles 
new vehicle sales as of december   our dealerships represented a diverse portfolio of american  european and asian brands 
our new vehicle sales consist of the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new vehicle retail and the sale of new vehicles to commercial customers fleet the terms new vehicle retail and fleet being together referred to as new 
new vehicle revenue and new vehicle gross profit consist of revenue and gross profit from new vehicle retail and fleet sales 
in  we sold  new vehicles through our dealerships 
we evaluate the results of our new vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
our new vehicle business represented of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  our new vehicle revenues include new vehicle sale and lease transactions arranged by our dealerships with third parties 
we believe leases provide a number of benefits 
as a result of fixed period lease terms  customers who lease new vehicles have historically returned to our dealerships more frequently than customers who purchase new vehicles 
in addition  because third party lessors frequently give the leasing dealerships the first option to purchase vehicles returned by their customers at lease end  leases typically provide us with an additional source of late model vehicles for our used vehicle inventory 
generally  leased vehicles remain under manufacturer warranty for the term of the lease  which results in additional parts and services revenue  as authorized dealerships are typically relied upon to provide warranty repair service to the lessee throughout the lease term 
used vehicle sales we sell used vehicles at all of our dealership locations 
used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being together referred to as used 
in  we sold  used retail vehicles through our dealerships 
we evaluate the results of our used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold 
our used retail vehicle business  which generally has higher gross margins than our new vehicle business  accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  wholesale sales represented of our total revenues  but did not have a material impact on our total gross profit for the year ended december  gross profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and the use of advanced technology to manage our inventory 
our new vehicle operations typically provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of high quality trade ins and off lease vehicles  which we believe are good sources of attractive used vehicle inventory 
we also purchase a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory at auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers offering off lease  rental and fleet vehicles and open auctions that offer vehicles sold by other dealers and repossessed vehicles 
our used vehicle inventory is typically sold as wholesale if a vehicle is not sold at retail within days  except for used vehicles that do not fit within our inventory mix  which are typically sold as wholesale almost immediately 
the reconditioning of used vehicles also generates revenue for our parts and service departments 
parts and service we sell replacement parts and provide vehicle maintenance and collision repair service at all of our franchised dealerships  primarily for the vehicle brands sold at those dealerships 
in addition  as of december   we maintained free standing collision repair centers either on the premises of  or in close proximity to  our dealerships 
our parts and service business accounted for approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  historically  parts and service revenues have been more stable than those from vehicle sales 
industry wide  parts and service revenues have consistently increased over time primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles  the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increasing number of vehicles on the road  although the significant declines in new vehicle sales in and could lead to a decline in parts and service revenues in the near term 
the automotive parts and service industry tends to be highly fragmented  with franchised dealerships and independent repair shops competing for this business 
we believe  however  that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles is making it difficult for independent repair shops to compete effectively for our parts and service business 
these independent repair shops may not be able to invest in the equipment and training necessary to perform major or technical repairs  especially as such repairs relate to luxury and mid line imports  which comprise a significant majority of our new vehicle retail sales 
we believe our parts and service business is also well positioned to benefit from the service work potentially generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us  as historically these customers have tended to have their vehicles serviced at the location where they purchase extended service contracts 
additionally  vehicle manufacturers generally require manufacturer warranty work to be performed only at franchised dealerships 
as a result  unlike 
table of contents independent service stations or independent and superstore used car dealerships with service operations  our franchised dealerships are authorized to perform work covered by manufacturer warranties on increasingly technologically complex vehicles 
finance and insurance we refer to the finance and insurance portion of our business as f i 
through our f i business  we arrange  and receive commissions for  third party financing of the sale or lease of new and used vehicles to customers  as well as offer a number of aftermarket products  as described below 
we also generate f i revenues from the receipt of certain marketing fees paid to us under agreements with preferred lenders 
our f i business generated approximately of our total revenues and of our total gross profit for the year ended december  the following is a brief description of our significant f i product offerings extended service contracts covers certain repair work after the expiration of the manufacturer warranty  guaranteed asset protection gap debt cancellation covers the customer after a total loss for the difference between the value of the vehicle and the outstanding loan or lease obligation after insurance proceeds  prepaid maintenance covers certain routine maintenance work  such as i oil changes  ii cleaning and adjusting of brakes  iii multi point vehicle inspections and iv tire rotations  and credit life and disability covers the remaining amounts due on an auto loan or a lease in the event of death or disability 
we earn sales based commissions from third party lenders  including manufacturer captive finance subsidiaries  on substantially all of the financing that we arrange on behalf of our customers 
we may be charged back chargebacks for these commissions in the event a finance contract is canceled or repaid  typically within the first days of such contract 
we arranged customer financing on approximately of the vehicles we sold during the year ended december  we do not retain any material liability for the credit risk associated with these purchase and lease transactions after the completion of the transactions 
similarly  we may be required to refund a portion of our profit relating to the sale of service contracts  maintenance and insurance and other products in the event of early cancellation 
we do not  however  bear any risk related to insurance payments  which are borne by third parties 
we receive discounted pricing compared to smaller competitors in our local markets on many of the service contracts  maintenance and insurance products that we provide as a result of our size and sales volume 
historically  chargebacks on finance and service contracts  maintenance and insurance products have totaled between and of total f i revenue 
we are party to a number of preferred lender agreements 
under the terms of these preferred lender agreements  each lender has agreed to provide a marketing fee to us above the standard commission rate for each loan that our dealerships places with that lender 
furthermore  many of the service contracts and insurance products we sell result in underwriting profits and investment income for us based on portfolio performance 
the underwriting profits and investment income  if any  represent the amount of funds available to pay future claims in excess of what is actually used to pay claims on the related policies 
these payments are determined by the lenders based upon an agreed upon earnings schedule 
recent developments in february  our board of directors elected to terminate the asbury wealth accumulation plan the deferred compensation plan 
please refer to note share based compensation and employee benefit plans for a detailed description of the deferred compensation plan 
as a result of this decision  we reclassified million of assets and million of liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plan from other long term assets and other long term liabilities  respectively  to other current assets and accounts payable and other current liabilities  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  business strategy focus on premier brand mix  strategic markets and diversification we classify our new vehicle retail sales into the following categories luxury  mid line import  and mid line domestic 
luxury and mid line imports together accounted for approximately of our new vehicle sales for the year ended december  despite a recent modest increase in sales of mid line domestic vehicles  we continue to believe that  over the long term  luxury and mid line import manufacturers are well positioned to continue the market share gains they have achieved in the united states over the past few decades based on the expectation of continued broadening of their product 
table of contents offerings and the delivery of high quality products and services to their customers 
our physical locations encompassed different metropolitan markets at locations in the following states as of december  arkansas  florida  georgia  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  south carolina  texas and virginia 
we believe that our broad geographic coverage  as well as diversification among manufacturers  decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and manufacturer specific risks such as warranty issues or production disruption 
the following table reflects i the number of franchises and ii the percent of new vehicle revenues represented by each class of franchise as of december  class franchise number of franchises as of december  of new vehicle revenues for the year ended december  luxury bmw acura mercedes benz infiniti lincoln lexus volvo audi jaguar porsche cadillac land rover fisker total luxury mid line import honda nissan toyota sprinter mini smart mazda volkswagen hyundai kia total mid line import mid line domestic ford dodge chevrolet chrysler jeep buick gmc total mid line domestic total franchises 
table of contents franchise accounted for less than of new vehicle revenues for the year ended december  maintain disciplined cost structure and emphasize expense control we continually focus on expense control at our dealerships 
we are constantly evaluating our cost structure  and believe we are well positioned to manage our costs in the future by centralizing our financial and information processing systems  deploying information technology and best practices across our dealership network  capitalizing on our scale through negotiating contracts with certain of our vendors on a national basis  and maintaining a performance based compensation structure 
for example  in order to reduce our expenses  in we completed a corporate and regional restructuring  which included the relocation of our corporate offices and the reorganization of our retail network  and also included the elimination of our regional management structure 
these restructuring and reorganization activities allowed us to continue realizing cost savings through and in order to mitigate the impact of significant fluctuations in vehicle sales  we tie management and employee compensation at various operational levels to performance through incentive based pay systems based on various metrics 
for example  a portion of management s stock based compensation is based on overall performance criteria relative to our peer group  including  profitability growth  productivity improvement and return on invested capital measures 
we also compensate our general managers  department managers and sales and other dealership personnel with incentive pay  based on metrics such as dealership profitability  departmental profitability and individual performance  as appropriate 
flexible and prudent capital allocation our capital allocation decisions are primarily based on our desire to maintain sufficient liquidity and a prudent capital structure 
we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon i our cash and cash equivalents on hand  ii the funds that we expect to generate through future operations  iii current and expected borrowing availability under our credit facilities and mortgage financings  iv amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset accounts and v the potential impact of any contemplated or pending future transactions  including  but not limited to  financings  acquisitions  dispositions or other capital expenditures 
as part of our balanced approach  we continuously evaluate capital deployment opportunities that we believe will maximize the value of our company  including investing in our business and technology  acquiring dealerships that meet our internal return threshold  repurchasing shares of our common stock in the open market  and reducing our leverage through the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness and purchasing properties currently under lease 
we may at some time in the future return some portion of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends 
focus on higher margin products and services while new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships  parts and service  used vehicle retail sales  and f i generally provide significantly higher profit margins and account for the majority of our profitability 
in order to maximize the growth of these higher margin businesses  we have discipline specific executives at both the corporate and dealership levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers 
local management of dealership operations we believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales  customer service and inventory requirements 
the general manager of each of our dealerships is responsible for the operations  personnel and financial performance of that dealership as well as other day to day operations 
we believe our 
table of contents general managers familiarity with their respective markets enables them to effectively run day to day operations  market to customers and recruit new employees 
the general manager of each dealership is supported  in most cases  by a new vehicle sales manager  a used vehicle sales manager  an f i manager  and a parts and service manager 
our dealership management teams typically have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry 
this management structure is complemented by support from the corporate office through centralized technology and financial oversight 
centralized administrative and strategic functions our corporate management is responsible for our capital structure and operating strategy while the implementation of our operating strategy rests with each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established by corporate management 
corporate management continuously evaluates the financial and operating results of our dealerships  as well as each dealership s geographical location  and from time to time  makes decisions to acquire or dispose of dealerships to refine our dealership portfolio 
as part of our investment in our it systems  in june  we undertook the deployment of a common dealer management system dms with the dealer services group of automatic data processing  inc as our provider 
the implementation of this system was substantially complete by the end of we believe a single dms will provide the foundation for future efficiencies and create a more efficient retail operation that will result in a better experience for our customers 
we consolidate financial  accounting and operational data received from our dealerships through customized financial products 
our it approach enables us to integrate and aggregate information from our dealerships 
through the combination of a common dms and our corporate financial products  management has access to the financial  accounting and operational data at various levels of the organization 
in addition  we have centralized our information technology  payroll and benefits administration from which we expect continued cost synergies 
commitment to customer service we are focused on providing a high level of customer service and have designed our dealerships services to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer 
we endeavor to establish relationships that we believe will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals 
furthermore  we provide our dealership managers with appropriate incentives to employ efficient selling approaches  engage in extensive follow up to develop long term relationships with customers and extensively train our sales staff to meet customer needs 
we continually evaluate opportunities  and implement appropriate new technologies  to improve the buying experience for our customers  and believe that our ability to share best practices across our multi jurisdictional platform gives us an advantage over independent dealerships 
for example  we recently implemented a common customer relations management tool in all of our dealerships to facilitate communications with customers before  during and after the sale 
we continue to invest in technologies designed to improve our sales process and employee productivity  all with the goal of improving the customer experience 
in addition  our higher margin parts and service operations are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service  providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty 
we continue to train our technicians and service advisors to ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service 
marketing consistent with our local management strategy  our advertising and marketing efforts are generally focused at the local market level  with the aim of building our business with a broad base of repeat  referral and new customers 
traditionally  we have spent the majority of our advertising dollars on television advertising 
however  we are experiencing a continued shift toward internet based advertising  including lead generation 
recognizing the fact that customers are increasing their use of interactive tools to make buying decisions  we continue to invest in the development of our e commerce strategy by focusing on online brand development  performing research to better understand the online consumer and their decision to visit one site versus another  and increasing marketing spend on online marketing 
in addition  radio  print  direct mail and the yellow pages make up a significant portion of our remaining advertising spend 
we also use electronic mail and social media channels to assist our marketing efforts and to stay in contact with our customers 
we use common marketing materials for our brand names using professional advertising agencies 
our total advertising 
table of contents expense from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   which equaled an average of per retail vehicle sold 
in addition  manufacturers direct advertising spending in support of their brands has historically been a significant component of the total amount spent on new car advertising in the united states 
competition the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automotive dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  other used vehicle retailers  including regional and national vehicle rental companies  internet based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers  service center and parts supply chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
for new vehicle sales  our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships  primarily in their regions 
we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
instead  we rely on our advertising and merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local branding and location of our dealerships to assist in the sale of new vehicles 
our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealers  large used car retail consolidators  regional and national vehicle rental companies  independent used car dealers  internet based vehicle brokers and private parties for supply and resale of used vehicles 
we compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs and with other automobile dealers and franchised and independent service centers for non warranty repair and routine maintenance business 
we compete with other automobile dealers  service stores and auto parts retailers in our parts operations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are our ability to use factory approved replacement parts  our competitive prices  our familiarity with a manufacturer s brands and models  and the quality of our customer service 
in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases  we compete with a broad range of financial institutions 
in addition  many financial institutions are now offering f i products through the internet  which may increase competition and reduce our profits on certain of these items 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience  interest rates and flexibility in contract length 
in addition  given our desire to hire experienced  talented and successful individuals  the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive 
as a result  we also compete with franchised dealers and other large automotive retailers for talented personnel 
seasonality the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for vehicles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year and  accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of any year 
if conditions occur during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected 
dealer and framework agreements each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer or in some cases the distributor of each brand of new vehicles sold and or serviced at the dealership 
a typical dealer agreement specifies the locations at which the dealer has the right and obligation to sell the manufacturer s vehicles and related parts and products and or to perform certain approved services 
each dealer agreement also governs the use of the manufacturer s trademarks and service marks 

table of contents the allocation of new vehicles among dealerships is subject to a published formula which is derived at the discretion of the manufacturer  and generally does not guarantee the dealership exclusivity within a given territory or otherwise 
most dealer agreements impose requirements on substantially all aspects of the dealer s operations 
for example  most of our dealer agreements contain provisions and standards related to  among other things  the following inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts  maintenance of minimum net working capital requirements  and in some cases  minimum net worth requirements  achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets  advertising and marketing practices  facilities and signs  products offered to customers  dealership management  personnel training  information systems  geographic market  including but not limited to requirements to meet sales and service targets within an assigned market area  geographic limitations on where the dealership may locate or advertise  and restrictions on the export of vehicles  and dealership monthly and annual financial reporting 
in addition to requirements under dealer agreements  we are subject to additional provisions contained in supplemental agreements  framework agreements  dealer addenda and manufacturers policies  collectively referred to as framework agreements 
framework agreements impose requirements on us in addition to those described above 
such agreements also define other standards and limitations  including company wide performance criteria  capitalization requirements  limitations on changes in our ownership or management  limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us  restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries  and conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions  including sales and customer satisfaction criteria  as well as limitations on the total local  regional and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition 
some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to purchase its dealerships from us under certain circumstances  including upon the occurrence of an extraordinary corporate transaction without the manufacturer s prior consent or a material breach of the framework agreement 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer s brands to a third party 
these agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under applicable state laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration 
certain of our dealer agreements expire after a specified period of time  ranging from one year to eight years  while other of our agreements have a perpetual term 
we expect that we will be able to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business 
however  typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non renewal of the dealer agreement under certain circumstances  including insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership  failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels  impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership  change of control of the dealership without manufacturer approval including certain material changes in the composition of our board of directors during a specified time period  the acquisition of or more of our voting stock by another vehicle manufacturer or distributor  or the acquisition of or more of our voting stock by a person  entity or group not affiliated with the vehicle manufacturer or distributor  
table of contents certain extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer  or material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement 
while one or more of our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed due to a number of circumstances  it may be possible to negotiate a waiver of termination or non renewal with the manufacturer 
notwithstanding that  however  no assurances can be provided that upon the termination or attempted termination  or nonrenewal of any agreement  we will be able to enter into new agreements  or waivers to any agreement  on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
our loss of any one or more of our dealer agreements  whether as a result of termination  expiration or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
applicable state laws generally provide that an automobile manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow them to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
our framework agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that  among other things  attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under these laws and  though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers ongoing lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of these laws 
if these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of these laws  it may also be more difficult for us to renew our dealer agreements upon expiration 
changes in laws that provide manufacturers the ability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  courts have held that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede these laws  resulting in either the termination  non renewal or rejection of franchises by such manufacturers  which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry 
under various state laws each of our dealerships must obtain one or more licenses in order to establish  operate or relocate a dealership or operate an automotive repair service in such state 
in addition  we are subject to numerous complex federal  state and local laws regulating the conduct of our business  including with respect to advertising  motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit  unfair and deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  environmental matters  land use and zoning  health and safety  and employment practices 
we actively make efforts to assure we are in compliance with the laws and related regulations that affect our business 
environmental matters 
table of contents we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and the remediation of contamination 
as with automobile dealerships generally  and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular  our business involves the generation  use  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes 
operations involving the management of wastes are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state statutes 
pursuant to these laws  federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling  storing  treating  transporting and disposing of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply 
our business also involves the use of above ground and underground storage tanks 
under applicable laws and regulations  we are responsible for the proper use  maintenance and abandonment of our regulated storage tanks and for remediation of subsurface soils and groundwater impacted by releases from existing or abandoned storage tanks 
in addition to these regulated tanks  we own  operate  or have otherwise closed in place other underground and above ground devices or containers such as automotive lifts and service pits that may not be classified as regulated tanks  but which could or may have released stored materials into the environment  thereby potentially obligating us to clean up any soils or groundwater resulting from such releases 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at or from our facilities or at facilities where we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes  impose liability for the entire cost of a cleanup  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
responsible parties include the owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at such sites 
these responsible parties also may be liable for damages to natural resources 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances 
currently  we are not aware of any material superfund or other remedial liabilities to which we are subject 
further  the federal clean water act and comparable state statutes prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without the necessary permits  require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances and require preparation of spill contingency plans 
we are not aware of any non compliance with the wastewater discharge requirements  requirements for the containment of potential discharges and spill contingency planning or other environmental laws applicable to our operations 
environmental laws and regulations are very complex and it has become difficult for businesses that routinely handle hazardous and non hazardous wastes to achieve and maintain full compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
from time to time we may experience incidents and encounter conditions that are not in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
however  none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past  nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future 
nevertheless  environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation and enforcement change frequently and we believe that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue 
as a result  there can be no assurance that compliance with environmental laws or regulations or the future discovery of unknown environmental conditions will not require additional expenditures by us  or that such expenditures would not be material 
our operations are subject to substantial changes in laws and regulations and related claims and proceedings  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  people 
we believe our relationship with our employees is favorable 
we do not have employees that are represented by a labor union  however  certain of our facilities are located in areas of high union concentration  and such facilities are susceptible to union organizing activity 
although we have not experienced any strikes or walkouts at our operations  because of our dependence on vehicle manufacturers  we may be affected adversely by labor strikes  work slowdowns and walkouts at vehicle manufacturers production facilities and transportation modes that are outside of our control 
insurance because of the vehicle inventory and the nature of the automotive retail business  automobile retail dealerships generally require significant levels of insurance covering a broad variety of risks 
our insurance program includes multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of million 
we are self insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims 
we have large deductible insurance programs in place for 
table of contents workers compensation  property and general liability claims 

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained and referred to in this report  you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business 
any of these risks  or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors  could cause our actual future results  performance or achievements to be materially different from or could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise  any of which could also materially adversely affect us 
if the automotive retail environment continues to be challenging and our dealerships are unable to generate sufficient cash  our liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
for the last four years  the automotive retail industry has experienced an unprecedented challenging environment 
the seasonally adjusted annual rate saar of new vehicle sales in the us  which was over million from to  decreased to approximately million in and million in although the automotive retail industry has begun to experience a modest recovery with the new vehicle saar reaching million in and million in  we believe that improvement in the industry will continue to be slow  with the new vehicle saar expected to improve only modestly in  as the long term prospects for  and the timing of  a full recovery continue to be difficult to predict 
during the initial downturn in the automotive retailing industry  our results of operations were adversely affected  and could again be adversely affected by the continuance of uncertain economic conditions  including any increased difficulty for consumers in securing vehicle financing as unemployment remains higher than recent historical averages 
if consumer financing becomes more difficult to obtain  the new vehicle saar could be negatively impacted  which in turn could further adversely impact our results of operations  our cash flows and ultimately our liquidity 
if we are unable to generate sufficient operating cash flows  we may need to enter into certain extraordinary transactions in order to generate additional cash  which may include  but not be limited to  selling certain of our dealerships or other assets or increasing borrowings under our existing  or any future  credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  we will be able to enter into any such transactions in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all 
furthermore  in the event we were required to sell dealership assets  the sale of any material portion of such assets could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
our dealerships profitability depends in large part upon customer demand for the particular vehicle lines they carry  and the availability to us of such popular vehicles 
the profitability of our dealerships depends in large part on customer demand for the vehicle lines they carry 
historically  we have generated most of our revenue through new vehicle sales 
new vehicle sales also tend to lead to sales of higher margin products and services such as finance and insurance products and parts and services 
we depend on our ability to obtain a desirable mix of popular new vehicles from manufacturers 
typically  popular vehicles produce the highest profit margins but are the most difficult to obtain from manufacturers 
manufacturers generally allocate their vehicles among their franchised dealerships based on the sales history of each dealership  and in some instances on the level of capital expenditures associated with such dealerships 
if our dealerships experience prolonged periods of sales declines  those manufacturers may cut back their allotments of popular vehicles to our dealerships and  as a result  our new vehicle sales and profits may decline 
if our brand mix is significantly concentrated in any one vehicle brand  and the manufacturer of such brand experiences any disruptions in its operations  develops a poor reputation or there is a decrease in customer demand for vehicles produced by such manufacturer  there could be material adverse affects on our revenues  operational results and profitability 
although we have sought to limit our dependence on any one vehicle brand  we have focused and continue to focus our new vehicle sales operations primarily on mid line import and luxury brands  and there can be no assurance that our brand mix is appropriate or sufficiently diverse to protect from a significant decline in the desirability of vehicles manufactured by a particular manufacturer 
our current brand mix is weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands  with the remaining consisting of domestic brands 
for the year ended december   brands representing or more of our revenues from new vehicle sales were as follows 
table of contents brand of total new vehicle revenues honda nissan toyota bmw ford mercedes benz lexus acura if a manufacturer fails to produce desirable vehicles or develops a reputation for producing undesirable vehicles  and we own dealerships that sell that manufacturer s vehicles  our revenues at those dealerships could be adversely affected as consumers shift their vehicle purchases toward more desirable brands  makes and models 
likewise  if the manufacturer experiences any disruption in its ability to produce vehicles  thus limiting the supply of vehicles to our dealerships  it could have a material adverse affect on our revenues  results of operations and profitability 
if the profitability at certain of our dealerships is adversely affected  there could be a significant reduction of our cash flows  which in turn could result in impairments of such dealership s properties and or intangible assets 
changes or declines in consumer demand  or delays in nonessential services  due to general economic conditions  changes in preferences  or otherwise  could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business is heavily dependent on consumer demand and preferences  and our key partners respective abilities to adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences 
further  retail vehicle sales are cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
these cycles are often dependent on general economic conditions and consumer confidence  as well as levels of discretionary personal income  credit availability and interest rates 
in addition  in recent periods fuel prices have been unstable and have reached and remain near historically high levels 
if gasoline prices remain near historical highs  or materially increase  this could cause a further reduction in automobile purchases and a further shift in buying patterns from less fuel efficient luxury or suv models which typically provide higher profit margins to automotive retailers to smaller  more fuel efficient and economical vehicles which typically have lower profit margins 
a shift in preferences by consumers to smaller  more economic vehicles due to pricing  fuel costs or otherwise may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
while a decline in vehicle purchases in some instances creates additional demand for parts and services due to the aging of and increased wear and tear on existing vehicles  in difficult economic conditions  people often delay nonessential service and repairs on their vehicles 
continued delays on the service and repairs of vehicles due to a continual decline in economic conditions or otherwise could have a further adverse effect on the revenues and results of operations of our parts and service business  which has traditionally produced higher profit margins for our business relative to vehicle sales 
conversely  in the recent past  we have seen the prices of used vehicles generally increase  creating an increased demand for new vehicles 
a relative increase in new vehicle sales versus used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as used vehicle sales have traditionally produced relatively higher profit margins for our business 
we have significant debt  and the ability to incur additional debt may limit our flexibility to manage our business 
furthermore  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash  our ability to service our debt may be materially adversely affected 
we have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total debt of million  excluding floor plan notes payable and the million unamortized discount on our convertible notes on our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional debt from time to time to finance  among other things  acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures  and new and used vehicle inventory  as well as to refinance new and used vehicle inventory  subject in each case to the restrictions contained in the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes  and our mortgage agreements and related mortgage guarantees  as well as certain other agreements 
we will continue to have substantial debt service obligations  consisting of required cash payments of principal and interest  for the foreseeable future 

table of contents our significant indebtedness could have important consequences to us  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital or other general corporate purposes may be impaired  a substantial portion of our current cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations and other corporate purposes  some of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest  which exposes us to certain risks of interest rate increases  and we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and governmental regulations 
as a result of the foregoing and other potential limitations  our indebtedness obligations may limit our ability to take strategic actions that would otherwise enable us to manage our business  in a manner in which we otherwise would  absent such limitations  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a holding company and as a result are dependent on our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash and distribute cash to us to service our indebtedness 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  fund our ongoing operations and invest in capital expenditures and any acquisitions will depend on our subsidiaries ability to generate cash in the future and distribute that cash to us 
it is possible that our subsidiaries may not generate cash from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness 
many of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on payments to us and our affiliates under their franchise agreements  dealer agreements  other agreements with manufacturers  mortgages  and credit facilities 
for example  most of the agreements contain minimum working capital or net worth requirements  and some manufacturers dealer agreements specifically prohibit a distribution to us if the distribution would cause the dealership to fail to meet such manufacturer s capitalization guidelines  including net working capital 
these restrictions limit our ability to utilize profits generated from one subsidiary at other subsidiaries or  in some cases  at the parent company 
these factors could also render our subsidiary guarantors financially or contractually unable to make payments under their guarantees of our senior subordinated notes 
under several of our debt  mortgage  lease and framework agreements  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants 
our failure to comply with certain covenants in these agreements could adversely affect our ability to access our borrowing capacity  subject us to acceleration of our outstanding debt or result in a cross default on other indebtedness  and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
there are operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt and mortgage agreements  including the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities  the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and our mortgage agreements and related mortgage guarantees  as well as certain other agreements to which we are a party 
these limit  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional debt  create certain liens or other encumbrances  and make certain payments including dividends and repurchases of our common stock and for investments 
certain of these agreements also require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
if we are unable to comply with any applicable financial or other covenants  we may be required to seek waivers of or modifications to our covenants from our creditors  or we may need to undertake a transaction designed to generate proceeds sufficient to repay our debt 
obtaining such waivers or modifications often requires the payment to creditors of significant fees and requires significant time and attention of management 
in light of continued uncertain conditions in the automotive industry and the conditions in the credit markets generally  we cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any necessary actions at times  or on terms acceptable to us 
our failure to comply with any of these covenants in the future could constitute a default under the relevant agreement  which would  depending on the relevant agreement  i entitle the creditors under such agreement to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreement and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings  ii require us to apply our available cash to repay these borrowings  iii entitle the creditors under such agreement to foreclose on the property securing the relevant indebtedness  and or iv prevent us from making debt service payments on certain of our other indebtedness  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in many cases  a default under one of our debt or mortgage  agreements could trigger cross default provisions in one or more of our other debt or mortgages 

table of contents in addition to the financial and other covenants contained in our various debt or mortgage agreements  a number of our dealerships are located on properties that we lease 
certain of the leases governing such properties have certain covenants with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with the covenants under our leases  the respective landlords could  among other remedies  terminate the leases and seek damages that could equal the amount by which the accelerated rents under the applicable leases for the remainder of the lease terms exceed the fair market rent over the same period  or evict us from the applicable properties 
similarly  our failure to comply with any financial or other covenants in any of our framework agreements would give the relevant manufacturer certain rights  including the right to reject proposed acquisitions  and may give it the right to repurchase its franchises from us 
events that give rise to such rights  and our inability to acquire additional dealerships or the requirement that we sell one or more of our dealerships at any time  could inhibit the growth of our business  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturers may have the right to restrict our ability to provide guaranties of our operating companies  pledges of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and liens on our assets  which could adversely impact our ability to obtain financing for our business and operations on favorable terms or at desired levels  if at all a decline in our credit rating or a general disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact liquidity and ability to conduct our operations 
access to funding allows us to take strategic actions for the benefit of our business 
a deterioration of our credit rating  or a general disruption in the credit markets  could limit our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms  which could in turn materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to conduct our operations 
in the recent past  global financial markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile  and continue to be uncertain 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of certain credit risks and weak economic conditions in certain industries and sectors have made it more difficult to obtain funding than in the past 
we currently maintain senior secured credit facilities with bank of america  na and a syndicate of other banks and we have hedge transactions in place with wells fargo bank  na  wachovia financial services  inc  goldman sachs co 
and deutsche bank ag  london branch 
if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us or have entered into hedge or similar transactions with us are further adversely affected by the current uncertain conditions in the us and international capital markets  they may become unable or unwilling to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us or otherwise fulfill their obligations under the relevant agreements with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  the cost of credit generally has increased coincident with the uncertain financial markets  as many lenders and institutional investors have enacted more stringent lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt and and  in some cases  increased interest rates or reduced or even ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
our inability to access necessary or desirable funding  or to enter into certain related transactions  at times and at costs deemed appropriate by us  could have a negative impact on our liquidity and ability to conduct our operations 
our capital costs and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we generally finance our purchases of new vehicle inventory  have the ability to finance the purchases of used vehicle inventory and have the availability to borrow funds for working capital using senior secured credit facilities under which we are charged interest at variable rates 
therefore  our interest expense from variable rate debt will rise with increases in interest rates 
in addition  a significant rise in interest rates may also have the effect of depressing demand in the interest rate sensitive aspects of our business  particularly new and used vehicle sales  because most of our customers finance their vehicle purchases 
as a result  rising interest rates may have the effect of simultaneously increasing our capital costs and reducing our revenues 
given our debt composition as of december   each one percent increase in market interest rates would increase our total annual interest expense  including floor plan interest  by as much as million 
when considered in connection with reduced expected sales as and if interest rates increase  any such increase could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse conditions affecting the manufacturers of the vehicles that we sell may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
our ability to successfully market vehicles to the public depends to a great extent on aspects of manufacturers operations 

table of contents vehicle manufacturers have been  and continue to be  adversely affected by the recent us and international economic climate 
in addition to challenges created by economic conditions  we remain vulnerable to other matters impacting the manufacturers 
for example  the earthquake and related events that occurred in japan in march negatively impacted certain manufacturers ability to provide vehicles and related parts which  in turn  negatively impacted our operations 
other factors that could negatively impact include financial condition  marketing efforts  reputation for quality  manufacturer and other product defects  including recalls  management  disruptions in the production and delivery of vehicles and parts due to natural disasters or other reasons that are outside of our control  and labor relations 
adverse conditions that materially affect a vehicle manufacturer and impact its ability to profitably design  market  produce or distribute new vehicles could in turn materially adversely affect our ability to i sell vehicles produced by that manufacturer  ii obtain or finance our desired new vehicle inventories  iii access or benefit from manufacturer financial assistance programs  iv collect in full or on a timely basis any amounts due therefrom  and or v obtain other goods and services provided by the impacted manufacturer 
our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects could be materially adversely affected as a result of any event that has an adverse effect on any vehicle manufacturers or distributors 
in addition  if a vehicle manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  among other things  i the manufacturer could seek to terminate or reject all or certain of our franchises  ii if the manufacturer is successful in terminating all or certain of our franchises  we may not receive adequate compensation for those franchises  iii our cost to obtain financing for our new vehicle inventory may increase or no longer be available from such manufacturer s captive finance subsidiary  iv consumer demand for such manufacturer s products could be materially adversely affected  especially if costs related to improving such manufacturer s poor financial condition are imputed to the price of its products  v there may be a significant disruption in the availability of consumer credit to purchase or lease vehicles or negative changes in the terms of such financing  which may negatively impact our sales  or vi there may be a reduction in the value of receivables and inventory associated with that manufacturer 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if vehicle manufacturers reduce or discontinue sales incentive  warranty or other promotional programs  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our dealerships benefit from certain sales incentive  warranty and other promotional programs of vehicle manufacturers that are intended to promote and support their respective new vehicle sales 
key incentive programs include customer rebates on new vehicles  dealer incentives on new vehicles  special financing or leasing terms  warranties on new and used vehicles  and sponsorship of used vehicle sales by authorized new vehicle dealers 
manufacturers often make many changes to their incentive programs during each year 
any reduction or discontinuation of key manufacturers incentive programs may reduce our sales volume which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our vehicle sales  results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by depressed levels of available consumer financing 
the majority of vehicle purchases are financed 
during and as a result of the recent global economic downturn  consumers experienced a decline in the availability of credit 
in addition  manufacturers decreased the availability of leases or  in some instances  terminated leasing programs altogether 
the reduced availability of credit to consumers contributed to the recent 
table of contents decline in our vehicle sales 
continued reductions or increased costs of credit could result in a further decline in our vehicle sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
sub prime lenders have historically provided financing to those buyers who  for various reasons  do not have access to traditional financing  including those buyers who have a poor credit history or lack the down payment necessary to purchase a vehicle 
with the downturn of the economy  sub prime lenders have become more stringent with their credit standards  which has made it more difficult for consumers needing sub prime financing to obtain credit 
if this trend continues  the ability of these consumers to purchase vehicles could remain limited  resulting in a decline in our vehicle sales  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable conditions in one or more of our local markets  even if those conditions are not prominent nationally 
our overall corporate results are also subject to local economic  competitive and other conditions prevailing in the various geographic markets in which we operate 
our dealerships currently are located in the atlanta  austin  charlottesville  dallas fort worth  durham  fayetteville  fort pierce  greensboro  greenville  houston  jackson  jacksonville  little rock  orlando  princeton  richmond  st 
louis and tampa markets 
if economic conditions remain uncertain  we experience a decline in value of our local brands for any reason  consumer spending remains low or competition for services offered by automotive retailers remains significant in any of these markets  or any of these factors becomes exacerbated  our business could be adversely affected 
if we fail to obtain renewals of one or more of our dealer agreements on acceptable terms  if certain of our franchises are terminated  if certain manufacturers rights under their agreements with us are triggered  or if the geographic areas of any of our franchises are altered  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
each of our dealerships operates under the terms of a dealer agreement with the manufacturer or manufacturer authorized distributor of each new vehicle brand it carries and or is authorized to service  and we operate under additional framework agreements with some vehicle manufacturers  which contain additional requirements that govern the particular vehicle manufacturer s franchises 
our dealerships may obtain new vehicles from manufacturers  service vehicles  sell new vehicles and display vehicle manufacturers trademarks only to the extent permitted under these agreements 
as a result of the terms of our dealer  framework and related agreements and our dependence on the rights granted by the manufacturers  the manufacturers have the right to exercise a great deal of control over our day to day operations  and the terms of these agreements govern key aspects of our operations  acquisition strategy and capital spending 
our dealer agreements may be terminated or not renewed by manufacturers for a number of reasons  and many of the manufacturers have the right to direct us to divest our dealerships if there is a default under the franchise agreement  an unapproved change of control including certain material changes in the composition of our board of directors during a specified time period  the acquisition of or more of our voting stock by another vehicle manufacturer or distributor  or the acquisition of or more of our voting stock by a person  entity or group not affiliated with the vehicle manufacturer or distributor  or certain other unapproved events including certain extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
our dealer agreements are scheduled to expire at various times 
although we expect that these agreements will be renewed in the ordinary course of business  there can be no assurances that we will be able to renew these agreements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms or at all 
most of our dealer agreements also provide the manufacturer with a right of first refusal to purchase any of the manufacturer s franchises we seek to sell 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected to the extent that our rights become compromised or our operations are restricted due to the terms of our dealer or framework agreements or if we lose franchises representing a significant percentage of our revenues 
our dealer agreements do not give us the exclusive right to a given geographic area 
manufacturers can establish new franchises or relocate existing franchises  subject to applicable state franchise laws 
the establishment or relocation of franchises in our markets could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of our dealerships in the market in which the franchise action is taken 
our failure to meet consumer satisfaction  financial or sales performance or facilities requirements specified by manufacturers may adversely affect our ability to acquire new dealerships and our profitability 
many manufacturers attempt to measure customers satisfaction with their experience in our sales and service departments through rating systems that are generally known in the automotive retailing industry as consumer satisfaction indices csi 

table of contents the use of csi ratings by manufacturers is in addition to their contractual rights to monitor the financial and sales performance of our dealerships 
at the time we acquire a dealership or enter into a new dealer or framework agreement  manufacturers will often establish sales or performance criteria for that dealership 
in accordance with the terms of these agreements  these criteria have been modified by various manufacturers in the past  and we cannot assure you that they will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future 
some of our dealerships have had difficulty meeting these criteria in the past 
we cannot assure you that any of our dealerships will be able to comply with these criteria in the future 
also  manufacturers often impose facilities requirements on our dealerships 
among other things  manufacturers may require us to move or renovate our dealerships to meet certain image standards 
image standards have been modified by manufacturers in the past  and we cannot assure you that the standards will not be further modified or replaced by different criteria in the future 
these commitments could require significant capital expenditures  which could have an adverse affect on our profitability 
in accordance with the terms of an applicable framework agreement  a manufacturer may use these criteria as factors in evaluating any application we may make for acquisitions of additional dealerships 
a manufacturer may refuse to consent to our acquisition of one of its franchises if it determines our dealerships do not comply with its performance criteria 
this would impede our ability to execute acquisitions and limit our ability to grow 
in addition  we receive payments and incentives from certain manufacturers based  in part  on our csi ratings  and future payments may be materially reduced or eliminated if our csi ratings do not meet stated criteria 
manufacturers actions in connection with any proposed acquisitions or divestitures may limit our future growth and impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are generally required to obtain manufacturer consent before we can acquire dealerships selling a manufacturer s automobiles 
in addition  many of our dealer and framework agreements require that we meet certain csi rating and sales performance criteria as a condition to additional dealership acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these performance criteria at any applicable time or that manufacturers will consent to future acquisitions  which may prevent us from being able to take advantage of strategic opportunities  and may limit our ability to expand our business 
the process of applying for and obtaining a manufacturer s consents can take a significant amount of time 
delays in consummating acquisitions caused by this process may negatively affect our ability to acquire dealerships that we believe will produce acquisition synergies and integrate well into our overall strategy 
in addition  manufacturers typically establish minimum capital requirements for each of their dealerships on a case by case basis 
as a condition to granting consent to a proposed acquisition  a manufacturer may require us to remodel or upgrade our facilities and capitalize the subject dealership at levels we would not otherwise choose to fund  causing us to divert our financial resources away from uses that management believes may be of higher long term value to us 
furthermore  the exercise by a manufacturers of its right of first refusal to acquire a dealership may prevent us from acquiring dealerships that we otherwise would acquire which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow through acquisitions  and therefore adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  from time to time  we may determine that it is in our best interest to divest one or more of our dealerships 
parties that are interested in acquiring any dealership may also be required to obtain the consent of the manufacturer 
the refusal by the manufacturer to approve a potential buyer may delay the sale of that dealership  and would require us to find another potential buyer or wait until the buyer is able to meet the requirements of the manufacturer 
a delay in the sale of a dealership could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  many vehicle manufacturers place limits on the total number of franchises that any group of affiliated dealerships may own 
certain manufacturers place limits on the number of franchises or share of total brand vehicle sales that may be maintained by an affiliated dealership group on a national  regional or local basis  as well as limits on store ownership in contiguous markets 
if we reach any of these limits  we may be prevented from making further acquisitions  which could adversely affect our future growth 
if state laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed  weakened or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers  our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination  non renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements 
applicable state laws generally provide that an automobile manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non renewal 
some state laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or allow them to attempt to comply with the manufacturer s criteria within a notice period to avoid the termination or non renewal 
our framework agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that  among other things  attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under 
table of contents these laws  and  though unsuccessful to date  manufacturers ongoing lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of these laws 
if these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate  manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice  an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause 
without the protection of these state laws  it may also be more difficult for us to renew our dealer agreements upon expiration 
changes in laws that provide manufacturers the ability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy  courts have held that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede the state laws that protect automotive retailers resulting in either the termination  non renewal or rejection of franchises by such manufacturers  which  in turn  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturers restrictions regarding a change in our stock ownership may result in the termination or forced sale of our franchises  which may have a number of impacts on us  including adversely impacting our business  financial condition and results of operations  or even deterring an acquisition of us 
some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements with manufacturers prohibit transfers of any ownership interests of a dealership or  in some cases  its parent  without the applicable manufacturer s consent 
our agreements with some manufacturers provide that  under certain circumstances  the manufacturer would have the right to terminate our agreement or force a sale of our franchise if a person or entity acquires an ownership interest in us above a specified level or if a person or entity acquires the right to vote a specified percentage of our common stock without the approval of the applicable manufacturer 
triggers of these clauses are often based upon actions by our stockholders and are generally outside of our control  and may result in the termination or non renewal of our dealer and framework agreements or forced sale of one or more franchises  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
these restrictions may also prevent or deter prospective acquirers from acquiring control of us and  therefore  may adversely impact the value of our common stock 
our business is seasonal  and events occurring during seasons in which revenues are typically higher may disproportionately affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the automobile industry is subject to seasonal variations in revenues 
demand for vehicles is generally lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of any year 
if conditions occur during the second or third quarters that weaken automotive sales  such as severe weather in the geographic areas in which our dealerships operate  war  high fuel costs  depressed economic conditions or similar adverse conditions  our revenues for the year may be disproportionately adversely affected 
our business may be adversely affected by import product restrictions  foreign trade risks and currency valuations that may impair our ability to sell foreign vehicles or parts profitably 
a portion of our business involves the sale of vehicles  parts or vehicles composed of parts that are manufactured outside the united states 
as a result  our operations are subject to customary risks of importing merchandise  including import duties  exchange rates  trade restrictions  work stoppages  natural or manmade disasters  and general political and socio economic conditions in other countries 
the united states or the countries from which our products are imported may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adjust presently prevailing quotas  duties or tariffs  which may affect our operations and our ability to purchase imported vehicles and or parts at reasonable prices 
relative weakness of the us dollar against foreign currencies in the future may result in an increase in costs to us and in the retail price of such vehicles or parts  which could discourage consumers from purchasing such vehicles and adversely impact our profitability 
if we are unable to acquire and successfully integrate additional dealerships  we may be unable to realize desired results and be required to divert resources from comparatively more profitable operations 
we believe that the automotive retailing industry is a mature industry whose sales are significantly impacted by the prevailing economic climate  both nationally and in local markets 
accordingly  we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to manage expansion  control costs in our operations and acquire and effectively and efficiently integrate acquired dealerships into our organization 
when seeking to acquire and acquiring other dealerships  we face risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisitions 
these risks include  but are not limited to failing to obtain manufacturers consents to acquisitions of additional franchises  incurring significant transaction related costs for both completed and failed acquisitions  incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses  failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships and impairing relationships with employees  
table of contents incorrectly valuing entities to be acquired or incurring undisclosed liabilities at acquired dealerships  disrupting our ongoing business and diverting our management resources to newly acquired dealerships  failing to achieve predicted performance levels  and impairing relationships with manufacturers and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not adequately anticipate all the demands that our growth will impose on our personnel  procedures and structures  including our financial and reporting control systems  data processing systems and management structure 
moreover  our failure to retain qualified management personnel at any acquired dealership may increase the risks associated with integrating the acquired dealership 
if we cannot adequately anticipate and respond to these demands  we may fail to realize acquisition synergies and our resources will be focused on incorporating new operations into our structure rather than on areas that may be more profitable 
there is competition to acquire automotive dealerships  and we may not be able to grow our business through acquisitions if attractive targets are not available or if market values result in prices at levels that we do not believe offer an acceptable rate of return 
we believe that the us automotive retailing market is fragmented and offers many potential acquisition candidates 
however  we often compete with several other national  regional and local dealership groups  and other strategic and financial buyers  some of which may have greater financial resources  in evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
competition for attractive acquisition targets may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us  and increased acquisition costs 
we may have to forego acquisition opportunities to the extent that we cannot negotiate such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
substantial competition in automobile sales and services may adversely affect our profitability 
the automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price  service  location and selection 
our competition includes franchised automobile dealerships in our markets that sell the same or similar new and used vehicles  privately negotiated sales of used vehicles  other used vehicle retailers  including regional and national vehicle rental companies  internet based used vehicle brokers that sell used vehicles to consumers  service center and parts supply chain stores  and independent service and repair shops 
we do not have any cost advantage over other retailers in purchasing new vehicles from manufacturers 
we typically rely on our advertising  merchandising  sales expertise  service reputation  strong local branding and dealership location to sell new and used vehicles 
further  our dealer agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer s product within a given geographic area 
our revenues and profitability may be materially and adversely affected if competing dealerships expand their market share or additional franchises are awarded in our markets 
property loss or other uninsured liabilities at some of our dealerships could impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the automotive retail business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property at dealership locations  including vehicles and parts 
we have historically experienced business interruptions from time to time at several of our dealerships due to adverse weather conditions or other extraordinary events  such as hurricanes in florida and tornadoes and hail storms in texas and mississippi 
concentration of property at dealership locations also makes the automotive retail business particularly vulnerable to theft  fraud and misappropriation of assets 
illegal or unethical conduct by employees  customers  vendors and unaffiliated third parties can result in loss of assets  disrupt operations  impact brand reputation  jeopardize manufacturer and other relationships  result in the imposition of fines or penalties  and subject us to governmental investigations or lawsuits 
other potential liabilities arising out of our operations may involve claims by employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
to the extent we experience future events such as these  or others  our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted 

table of contents while we maintain insurance to protect against a number of losses  this insurance coverage often contains significant deductibles which we must pay prior to obtaining insurance coverage 
in addition  we choose to self insure for a portion of our potential liabilities  meaning we do not carry insurance from a third party for such liabilities  and are wholly responsible for any related losses 
furthermore  the laws of some states prohibit insurance against certain types of liabilities  and so we self insure for those liabilities as well 
in certain instances  our insurance may not fully cover a loss depending on the applicable deductible or the magnitude and nature of the claim 
additionally  changes in the cost or availability of insurance in the future could substantially increase our costs to maintain our current level of coverage or could cause us to reduce our insurance coverage and increase our self insured risks 
to the extent we incur significant additional costs for insurance  suffer losses that are not covered by in force insurance or suffer losses for which we are self insured  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted 
business interruptions at any of our dealerships due to a failure of any of our management information systems  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we rely on management information systems at our dealerships which are licensed from third parties and are used in all aspects of our sales and service efforts  as well as in the preparation of our consolidated financial and operating data 
in  we began the conversion of our dealer management systems to a common dealer management system dms provided by adp 
as of december   approximately of our dealerships had been successfully converted to the adp dms  and we completed the remaining conversions of our dealerships in january our business could be significantly disrupted if i the adp dms fails to integrate with other third party management information systems  customer relations management tools or other software  or to the extent any of these systems become unavailable to us for an extended period of time for any reason  or ii if our relationship deteriorates with adp or any of our other third party providers 
any such significant disruption in our business could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
government regulations and environmental regulation compliance costs may adversely affect our business 
we are  and expect to continue to be  subject to a wide range of federal  state and local laws and regulations  including local licensing requirements 
these laws regulate the conduct of our business  including motor vehicle and retail installment sales practices  leasing  sales of finance  insurance and vehicle protection products  consumer credit  deceptive trade practices  consumer protection  consumer privacy  money laundering  advertising  land use and zoning  health and safety  and employment practices 
environmental laws and regulations govern  among other things  discharges into the air and water  storage of petroleum substances and chemicals  the handling and disposal of wastes and remediation of contamination arising from spills and releases 
in addition  we may also have liability in connection with materials that were sent to third party recycling  treatment and or disposal facilities under federal and state statutes 
these federal and state statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination 
similar to many of our competitors  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such federal and state statutes 
in addition  we may be subject to broad liabilities arising out of contamination at our currently and formerly owned or operated facilities  at locations to which hazardous substances were transported from such facilities  and at such locations related to entities formerly affiliated with us 
although for some such potential liabilities we believe we are entitled to indemnification from other entities  we cannot assure you that such entities 
table of contents will view their obligations as we do or will be able or willing to satisfy them 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  or significant additional expenditures required to maintain compliance therewith  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects 
if we or our employees at the individual dealerships violate or are alleged to violate laws and regulations applicable to them or protecting consumers generally  we could be subject to individual claims or consumer class actions  administrative  civil or criminal actions investigations or actions and adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties  including suspension or revocation of our licenses and franchises to conduct dealership operations 
some jurisdictions regulate finance fees and administrative or document fees that may be charged in connection with vehicle sales  which could restrict our ability to generate revenue from these activities 
furthermore  the enactment of new laws and regulations that materially impair or restrict our sales  finance and insurance  or other operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  and prospects 
for example  in recent years  private plaintiffs and state attorneys general in the united states have increased their scrutiny of advertising  sales  and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles 
these activities have led many lenders to limit the amounts that may be charged to customers as fee income for these activities 
if these or similar activities were to significantly restrict our ability to generate revenue from arranging financing for our customers  we could be adversely affected 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which was signed into law on july   established the consumer financial protection bureau  which has broad regulatory powers 
although automotive dealers are generally excluded from coverage within this agency  the dodd frank act and future regulatory actions by this bureau could lead to additional  indirect regulation of automotive dealers through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions 
likewise  employees and former employees are protected by a variety of employment laws and regulations 
allegations of a violation could subject us to individual claims or consumer class actions  administrative investigations or adverse publicity 
such actions could expose us to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs  injunctive relief and civil fines and penalties 
we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with employees and with customers regarding our products and services  and expect to continue to be subject to claims related to our existing business and any new business 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant license or permit or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and future prospects 
we further expect that  from time to time  new laws and regulations  particularly in the labor  employment  environmental and consumer protection areas will be enacted  and compliance with such laws  or penalties for failure to comply  could significantly increase our costs 
healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
rising healthcare costs and interest in universal healthcare coverage in the united states have resulted in government and private sector initiatives proposing significant healthcare reforms 
the patient protection and affordable care act  signed into law on march   is expected to increase our annual employee health care costs  with the most significant increases commencing in we cannot predict the extent of the effect of this statute  or any future state or federal healthcare legislation or regulation  will have on us 
however  an expansion in government s role in the us healthcare industry could result in significant long term costs to us  which could in turn adversely affect our future profitability and financial condition 
a data security breach with regard to personally identifiable information about our customers or employees could negatively affect operations and result in high costs 
in the ordinary course of business  we and our partners receive personally identifiable information pii about our customers in order to complete the sale or service of a vehicle and related products 
we also receive pii from our employees 
numerous state and federal regulations  as well as payment card industry and other vendor standards  govern the collection and maintenance of pii from consumers and other individuals 
although many companies across many industries are affected by malicious efforts to obtain access to pii  news reports suggest that the automotive dealership industry is a particular target of identity thieves 
moreover  there are numerous opportunities for a data security breach  including cyber security breaches  burglary  lost or misplaced data  scams  or misappropriation of data by employees  vendors or unaffiliated third parties 
despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement or adopt in the future  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  could be vulnerable to security breaches  computer viruses  lost or misplaced data  programming errors  scams  burglary  human errors  acts of vandalism  or other events 
alleged or actual data security breaches can increase costs of doing business  negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty  expose us to 
table of contents negative publicity  individual claims or consumer class actions  administrative  civil or criminal investigations or actions  and infringe on proprietary information 
governmental regulation pertaining to fuel economy cafe standards may affect a manufacturer s ability to produce cost effective vehicles  which would impact our sales 
the energy policy conservation act  enacted into law by congress in  added title v  improving automotive efficiency  to the motor vehicle information and cost savings act and established corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for passenger cars and light trucks 
cafe is the sales weighted average fuel economy  expressed in miles per gallon mpg of a manufacturer s fleet of passenger cars or light trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of  pounds or less  manufactured for sale in the us  for any given model year 
the primary goal of cafe was to substantially increase passenger car fuel efficiency 
congress has continuously increased the standards since and  since mid year  the passenger car standard was increased to miles per gallon  a level at which it has remained through passenger car fuel economy is now required to rise to an industry average of miles per gallon by likewise  significant changes to light truck cafe standards have been established over the years 
the standard is expected to be increased to about miles per gallon by the penalty for a manufacturer s failure to meet the cafe standards is currently per tenth of a mile per gallon for each tenth under the target volume times the total volume of those vehicles manufactured for a given model year 
failure of a manufacturer to develop passenger vehicles and light trucks that meet cafe standards could subject the manufacturer to substantial penalties  increase the cost of vehicles sold to us  and adversely affect our ability to market and sell vehicles to meet consumer needs and desires 
furthermore  congress may continue to increase cafe standards in the future and such additional legislation may have a further adverse impact on vehicle manufacturers and our business 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles we sell 
on december   the us environmental protection agency epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and could trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states  including facilities that emit more than  tons of greenhouse gases on an annual basis  beginning in for emissions occurring in at the state level  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our facilities  equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations 
in addition  similar regulations imposed on the owners of the vehicles that we sell could adversely affect demand for certain vehicles 
the loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success depends  to a significant degree  upon the continued contributions of our management team 
manufacturer dealer or framework agreements may require the prior approval of the applicable manufacturer before any change is made in dealership general managers or other management positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees may materially impair the profitability of our operations  or may result in a violation of an applicable dealer or framework agreement 
in addition  we may need to hire additional managers or other key personnel from time to time 
in some instances  potential acquisitions are more viable to us if we are able to retain experienced managers or obtain replacement managers should the owner or manager of an acquired dealership not continue to manage the business 
the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate  particularly for general managers and sales and service personnel  is highly competitive and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 
the loss of the services of key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified managers may adversely affect the ability of our dealerships to conduct their operations in accordance with the standards set by us or the manufacturers 
we depend on our executive officers as well as other key personnel 
although our ceo and coo have entered into 
table of contents agreements relating to their employment with us  most of our key personnel are not bound by employment agreements  and those with employment agreements are bound only for a limited period of time 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  we may be unable to successfully develop and implement our business plans  which may have an adverse effect on our business

item legal proceedings from time to time  we and our dealerships may become involved in various claims relating to  and arising out of our business and our operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states  operating franchises dealership locations in metropolitan markets within states as of december  we offer an extensive range of automotive products and services  including new and used vehicles  vehicle maintenance  replacement parts and collision repair services  and financing  insurance and service contracts 
as of december   we offered domestic and foreign brands of new vehicles 
our current brand mix is weighted towards luxury and mid line import brands  with the remaining consisting of domestic brands 
we also operate collision repair centers that serve customers in our local markets 
our retail network is made up of dealerships operating primarily under the following locally branded dealership groups coggin dealerships  operating primarily in jacksonville  fort pierce and orlando  florida  courtesy dealerships operating in tampa  florida  crown dealerships operating in new jersey  north carolina  south carolina and virginia  nalley dealerships operating in atlanta  georgia  mcdavid dealerships operating primarily in dallas and houston  texas  north point dealerships operating in little rock  arkansas  plaza dealerships operating in st 
louis  missouri  and gray daniels dealerships operating in jackson  mississippi 
our revenues are derived primarily from i the sale of new vehicles to individual retail customers new vehicle retail and commercial customers fleet the terms new vehicle retail  and fleet being together referred to as new  ii the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers used retail and to other dealers at auction wholesale the terms used retail and wholesale being together referred to as used  iii maintenance and collision repair services and the sale of automotive parts together referred to as parts and service  and iv the arrangement of vehicle financing and the sale of a number of aftermarket products  such as insurance and service contracts collectively referred to as f i 
we evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold  our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit  and f i based on dealership generated f i gross profit per vehicle sold 
we assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit by comparing the year to year results of stores that we have operated for at least twelve full months same store 
our organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy  the continued strength of our brand mix and the production of desirable vehicles by automotobile manufacturers whose brands we sell 
our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions  including consumer confidence  availability of consumer credit  fuel prices and employment levels 
we believe that the impact on our business of any future negative trends in new vehicle sales would be partially mitigated by i the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long term  ii the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure and iii our brand mix 
historically  our brand mix has been less affected by market volatility than the us automobile industry as a whole 
we believe that our new vehicle revenue brand mix  which included approximately revenue from mid line import brands and revenue from luxury brands for  is well positioned for growth over the long term 
our operating results are generally subject to changes in the economic environment as well as seasonal variations 
we tend to generate more revenue and operating income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
generally  the seasonal variations in our operations are caused by factors related to weather conditions  changes in manufacturer incentive programs  model changeovers and consumer buying patterns  among other things 
our gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix 
the sale of new vehicles generally results in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales and sales of parts and service 
as a result  when used vehicle and parts and service revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive based compensation  advertising  rent  insurance  utilities and other customary operating expenses 
a significant portion of our cost structure is variable such as sales commissions  or controllable such as advertising  generally allowing us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long term 
we evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross 
table of contents profit and all other sg a expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit  with the exception of advertising expense  which we evaluate on a per vehicle retailed pvr basis 
the united states automotive retail market has shown continued improvement in  with new vehicle saar increasing to million as compared to million in we believe that improvement in the industry will continue to be slow  with the new vehicle saar expected to improve only modestly in  as the long term prospects for  and the timing of  a full recovery continue to be difficult to predict 
we continue to evaluate potential consequences resulting from the natural disasters and related events in japan on our operating results 
disruption in new vehicle inventories from certain japanese manufacturers began during the second quarter of and continued into the fourth quarter of we currently expect that the resulting inventory supply shortages will subside by the first quarter of  although we can provide no assurance of this 
in addition  we do not expect that the disruption in the supply of inventory from our japanese manufacturing partners will have a material adverse effect on our earnings  results of operations or our business during  although we can provide no assurance of this

income tax expense the million increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of the million increase in income before income taxes in as compared to our effective tax rate decreased from for to for our effective tax rate is highly dependent on our level of income before income taxes and permanent differences between book and tax income

our total new vehicle revenue also benefited from million of revenue derived from acquisitions 
we believe that the increase in new vehicle retail unit sales was primarily driven by a favorable comparison with an overall weak economic environment during  as well as increased consumer confidence and less stringent consumer lending standards

the million increase in used vehicle gross profit was primarily a result of a million increase in same store used vehicle retail gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in same store used vehicle wholesale losses 
the increase in used vehicle retail revenue and gross profit was driven primarily by increased unit volume sales  partially offset by a lower gross profit margin of  down basis points from the prior year 
these results reflect a favorable comparison to an overall weak economic environment in  as well as the benefits of several store level programs initiated in  including volume driven initiatives such as our asbury program  a goal of retailing one used vehicle for every new vehicle retailed 
this initiative is designed to drive not only used retail volume  but to increase revenues from associated parts and service reconditioning and f i as well 
the increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed from to was primarily driven by i a mix shift towards our higher priced used vehicles  including certified pre owned  or cpo vehicles  as well as our full size used trucks and suvs and ii an increase in associated parts and service reconditioning  as reconditioning work generally increases the price of the related used vehicles

the million increase in parts and service gross profit was primarily due to a basis point increase in our same store parts and service gross margin primarily as a result of increased gross profit from reconditioning and preparation of vehicles

additionally  during  we used excess cash to reduce floor plan notes payable using floor plan offset accounts with certain of our floor plan lenders  effectively lowering our average floor plan notes payable balance during when compared to the prior year period 
we had approximately million in these floor plan offset accounts  on a daily weighted average basis  during we did not have any amounts in floor plan offset accounts during swap interest expense we have entered into various derivative financial instruments  including fair value and cash flow interest rate swaps  which have been designed to provide hedges against changes in fair value of certain debt obligations and variable rate cash flows

the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its initial fair value is amortized to interest cost using the effective interest method

covenants we are subject to a number of covenants in our various debt and lease agreements  including those described below 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants as of december  failure to comply with any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements  which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings  if any  unless compliance with the covenants is waived 
in many cases  defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross default provisions in our other agreements 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial or other covenants  we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders  or we would need to raise debt and or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt

certain of our lease agreements also require compliance with various financial covenants and incorporate by reference the financial covenants set forth in the credit agreement

subordinated note repurchases our board of directors has authorized us  from time to time  to repurchase various of our senior subordinated notes in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
the decision to repurchase our senior subordinated notes is dependent upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity position  applicable limitations in any agreements to which we are a party  and other factors 
currently  the credit agreement allows us to purchase at least million of our debt securities per calendar year  subject to increase based on availability under senior secured credit facilities 
in february  in accordance with the terms of our prior credit agreement  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of cash to repurchase outstanding convertible notes  notes or notes  which authorization expires february  this authority supersedes and replaces the previous authorization under which we had repurchased million of convertible notes 
during  we repurchased million of convertible notes in private transactions  which reduced our authorization to repurchase our senior subordinated notes to million as of december  stock repurchases in december  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
in july  our board of directors increased the authorization to repurchase common stock  resulting in million of remaining repurchase capacity 
during  we repurchased  million shares for a total of million

table of contents b includes variable interest calculated using an estimated libor rate of c in february  our board of directors elected to terminate the asbury wealth accumulation plan the deferred compensation plan 
as a result of this decision  we reclassified million of liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plan from other long term liabilities to other current assets and accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  cash flows classification of cash flows associated with floor plan notes payable borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a lender unaffiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle non trade  and all floor plan notes payable relating to pre owned vehicles together referred to as floor plan notes payable non trade  are classified as financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  with borrowings reflected separately from repayments 
the net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle collectively referred to as floor plan notes payable trade is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory  while the latter are payable to a lender not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory 
repayments of floor plan notes payable trade associated with divestitures are classified as an operating activity 
repayments of floor plan notes payable non trade associated with divestitures are classified as a financing activity 
floor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles  and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a short time period after the related vehicle is sold 
as a result  we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors ie  if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non trade floor plan financing as compared to us 
in addition  we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our internal operating cash flow forecasts 
as a result  we use the non gaap measure cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted defined below to compare our results to forecasts 
we believe that splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities  while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities  results in significantly different operating cash flow than if all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable were classified together in operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted  includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase the related vehicle 
cash provided by operating activities  as adjusted  has material limitations  therefore  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results in accordance with gaap 
in order to compensate for these potential limitations we also review the related gaap measures

stock repurchase and dividend restrictions pursuant to the indentures governing our notes and our notes  and the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities  our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay cash dividends is limited 
in accordance with such calculations  our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and pay cash dividends was limited to million under these agreements as of december   with an additional million available to repurchase common stock only 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements during any of the periods presented other than those disclosed in note and of our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting estimates described below are those that require management judgments  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
deferred income taxes estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and  if necessary  provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we would establish a valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized 
if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 
f i chargeback reserve we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts  credit life insurance and disability insurance to customers 
in addition  we receive commissions from financing institutions for arranging customer financing 
we may be charged back chargebacks for finance  insurance or vehicle service contract commissions in the event a customer prepays or defaults on a retail sales contract or cancels an insurance or warranty contract 
the revenues from financing fees and commissions are recorded at the time the vehicles are sold and a reserve for future chargebacks is established based on 
table of contents historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
this data is evaluated on a product by product basis 
our loss histories vary depending on the product but generally total between and of f i revenues 
our f i chargebacks from continuing operations for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
our chargeback reserves were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
total chargebacks as a percentage of f i revenue for the years ended december  and  were  respectively 
a change in our estimate for all our products would have changed finance and insurance  net on our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
used vehicle inventory lower of cost or market reserves our used vehicle inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the specific identification method to value our vehicle inventories 
we maintain a reserve for specific inventory units where cost basis exceeds fair value 
in assessing lower of cost or market for used vehicles  we consider i the aging of used vehicles  ii loss histories of used vehicles and iii current market conditions 
our used vehicle loss histories have indicated that our losses range between and of our used vehicle inventory 
our used vehicle losses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our used vehicle loss reserve was million  or of used vehicle inventory 
as of december   our used vehicle loss reserve was million  or of used vehicle inventory 
as of december   each change in our estimate would change our used vehicle reserve approximately million 
insurance reserves we are self insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims 
we have large deductible insurance programs in place for workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
we maintain and review at least monthly our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our future liability for these claims 
we also use professional service providers  such as account administrators and actuaries  to help us accumulate and assess this information 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of insurance reserves for both known and unknown employee medical  workers compensation  property and general liability claims 
expenses associated with employee medical  workers compensation  property and general liability claims from continuing operations  including premiums for insurance coverage  for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
manufacturer franchise rights our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers  which are recorded at an individual dealership level 
the fair market value of our manufacturer franchise rights is determined at the acquisition date through discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise 
we have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no legal  contractual  economic or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers brand names 
due to the fact that manufacturer franchise rights are specific to the location in which we acquire a dealership  we have determined that the dealership is the reporting unit for purposes of testing franchise rights for impairment 
we do not amortize manufacturer franchise rights 
we review indefinite lived manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually on october st of each year  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in fair market value of our individual franchises 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of manufacturer franchise rights are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  and other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluations of manufacturer franchise rights can vary within a range of outcomes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
based on million of total variable interest rate debt including floor plan notes payable outstanding as of december   a change in interest rates could result in a change of as much as million to our annual other interest expense 
we received million of interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  interest credit assistance reduced cost of sales including amounts classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december  by million and reduced new vehicle inventory by million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future floor plan interest credit assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased interest credit assistance from certain automobile manufacturers 
hedging risk we have an interest rate swap agreement which had a notional principal amount of million as of december  this swap was designed to provide a hedge against changes in variable interest rate cash flows through maturity in october the notional value of this swap was reduced through july  when the notional principal amount increased to million  and then began to reduce over the remaining term to million at maturity 
this interest rate swap qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and does not  and will not  contain any ineffectiveness 
in november  we chose to terminate an interest rate swap  which resulted in a cash payment of million  which equaled the fair market value of the swap agreement at the point of termination 
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was million million  net of tax of unrecognized amortization related to our terminated cash flow swap  which is being amortized through may as a component of swap interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the terminated swap liability is being amortized as a result of the probability of the original hedged item interest payments continuing to occur 
amortization of this terminated cash flow swap totaled million for the year ended december  amortization of this terminated cash flow swap will total approximately million for the year ended december  in june  one of our interest rate swap agreements matured 
this swap had been designed to provide a hedge against changes in variable rate cash flows  and had qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
the maturity of this swap did not have a material impact our consolidated financial statements

the effect of the convertible note hedge transactions is to unwind the conversion feature of the convertible notes 
under the terms of the convertible note hedge transactions we will receive shares from the counterparties in the event of a conversion of our convertible notes 
in connection with the repurchase of convertible notes  a portion of the convertible note hedges was terminated 
we also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby we sold to the counterparties warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  shares of our common stock at an initial strike price of per share  which was a premium over the market price of our common stock at the time of pricing 
as of december   the strike price was as a result of certain dividend payments
