item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
see the safe harbor cautionary statement above for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview we design  develop  market  sell and support powerful yet easy to use enterprise it infrastructure management software to it professionals in organizations of all sizes 
our offerings range from individual software tools to more comprehensive software products that solve problems faced every day by it professionals and help to enable efficient and effective management of their infrastructure  including networks  applications  storage and physical and virtual servers 
all of our products are ready to use  featuring intuitive and easily customized user interfaces and built in workflows 
our products can be downloaded directly from our websites and installed and configured by our end users in a matter of hours 
our customers include small and mid size businesses  enterprises  and local  state and federal government entities that have purchased our products 
we made a number of strategic investments in our business during that we believe are important to our long term growth 
through our product launches and strategic acquisitions we entered into several new markets including the system and application market  virtualization management market and the log and event management market 
we continued to focus on increasing our presence in several geographic markets including asian pacific  latin america  europe  middle east and africa 
we increased our presence in the asian pacific market by establishing new relationships with several distributors and reseller partners in japan and establishing our asian pacific headquarters in brisbane 
we also began the process of localizing certain products with country specific product documentation  websites and marketing material 
despite these investments and many others  we have continued to grow revenue and increase our cash flow from operations 
in the coming year  we plan to continue to focus on growth opportunities in the it infrastructure management market while expanding our customer base and brand awareness in the network  application  storage resource  virtualization and log and event management markets 
we believe our market penetration is low in all geographic and end user markets in which we sell products  therefore  our focus will continue to be on expanding partner relationships  localized web presence and products in various key international markets 
specifically  we intend to continue to expand in brazil  japan  china and germany 
in the new markets we have entered  we will continue our strategy of delivering powerful  easy to use and affordable software along with leveraging the web as the primary method to reach potential customers 
we will continue to look for acquisitions similar to those we have completed over the last year to supplement our internal product development efforts 
key financial highlights key financial highlights for include the following total revenue was million for compared to million for  or an increase of  net income was million compared to million for  or an increase of  net income was per share on a fully diluted basis for compared to per share on a fully diluted basis for  and cash flow from operations was million for compared to million for  or an increase of 

table of contents acquisitions we have made multiple acquisitions of businesses as part of our growth strategy 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the financial results for these entities have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
the more recent acquisitions are as follows in january  we acquired hyper  inc  or hyper  for approximately million in cash and contingent consideration ranging from to million based on sales milestones for the one year period after the closing of the acquisition 
hyper increased our product offerings to include virtualization management software and eliminated the normal time to market required to develop a new software product 
in july  we acquired trigeo network security  inc  or trigeo  for approximately million in cash 
by acquiring trigeo  we increased our product offerings to include log and event management software 
in october  we acquired dns enterprise  inc  or dns  a provider of free tools and inexpensive subscription based tools used by a community of system administrators  application administrators  network engineers and it professionals 
we do not believe this acquisition will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  we acquired certain assets of privately held dameware development llc  or dameware  for million in cash 
dameware increased our product offerings to include remote system management and administration software tools 
for further information regarding these acquisitions  see note  acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part iv of this annual report on form k 
key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics to help us monitor the performance of our business model and to identify trends affecting our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance are as follows revenue growth we have employed a differentiated business model for marketing and selling high volumes of enterprise class software  which is focused on rapid revenue growth at high operating margins 
we regularly review our total revenue growth to measure our success 
we have built a pricing model for our products that aims to maximize our recurring revenue and the value of a customer over time and not upfront license revenue 
this is an important component of our financial model 
this model is based on the premise that we will be able to deliver ongoing value to our customers and maintain a long term financial relationship with the users of our core enterprise class it management products 
our annual revenue growth percentages were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
core product transaction growth for new license sales 
we focus our sales  marketing and research and development efforts on it professionals in organizations of all sizes  with the goal of driving purchases of our software by these it professionals in short sales cycles 
in addition  many of our customers make small initial purchases of our software to manage specific components of their infrastructures and  then  make additional purchases over time to expand the use of the product that they purchased or to buy additional software products from us 
we review the core product transaction growth to ensure the effectiveness of our marketing and sales model 

table of contents we define our core product transactions as the number of new license sales transactions that include at least one of our core products 
we define a transaction as each invoice issued for the sale of one or more of our products 
if none of our core products is included in a particular transaction  then that transaction is not a core product transaction 
while our transactional products are important by creating broad awareness which may influence the purchase of our core products  the new license sales of core products represented more than of our license revenue for accordingly  we believe that management can better evaluate changes in our product portfolio  expansion into new markets and the addition of new customers by evaluating the transactional growth of our core products 
our core product transaction growth for new license sales was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non gaap operating income our management uses non gaap operating income to measure our performance 
because non gaap operating income excludes certain non cash expenses including amortization  stock based compensation and certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business  we believe that this measure provides us with additional useful information to measure and understand our performance  particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period 
we use non gaap operating income in the preparation of our budgets and to measure and monitor our performance 
non gaap operating income is not determined in accordance with gaap and is not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that reflects the cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment that can then be used for  among other things  strategic acquisitions and investments in the business  stock repurchases and funding ongoing operations 
we regularly review our free cash flow generation to measure our effectiveness at running our operations efficiently and in a manner that maximizes the value of our customers 
we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities plus the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and less the purchase of property and equipment 
free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period  is not determined in accordance with gaap and is not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
for further discussion regarding non gaap financial measures including non gaap operating income and free cash flow  see non gaap financial measures below 
opportunities and trends businesses  governments and other organizations are increasingly relying on data networks and it infrastructures to execute their operations  facilitate their internal and external communications and transact business with their customers and partners 
the size of these networks  the number of applications and servers  and the complexity of physical and virtual server environments are increasing as organizations place more reliance on them 
we believe that the increasing challenges of it infrastructure management and the limitations of existing offerings present a market opportunity for our products 
in addition to the network management products that we have offered since  we also offer products that we have developed or acquired and we believe these products allow us to compete effectively in the adjacent markets of systems and application  storage resource  virtualization and log and event management 
we expect our revenue to continue to grow as we capitalize on these and other market opportunities 
while we feel that we have integrated or begun to integrate our acquired businesses successfully  any revenue growth and operating synergies of our acquired products may be lower than expected if we are unable to do so in the future 
in  we recognized of our revenue from sales by our international subsidiaries 
we believe there is a substantial opportunity for additional sales of our software in the europe  middle east and africa region 
table of contents emea and the asian pacific region  and we intend to increase our sales  marketing and support operations in these regions 
however  we believe there is significant uncertainty regarding the economic conditions in certain of these geographic regions  particularly in parts of europe 
we believe that any difficult economic conditions may adversely affect the sales of our products  but could offer us an opportunity to market and sell our products to mid size businesses and enterprise customers at compelling prices compared to the prices of many competing products 
we expect the us federal government to continue to be a significant market opportunity  as we believe the ease of deployment  power and scalability of our products gives us an enhanced opportunity to sell to various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
the us federal government new license sales were of our total new licenses sales in we have experienced and continue to expect inconsistency in the buying pattern of the us federal government for larger transactions with our products 
our sales  both new licenses and maintenance renewals  to the us federal government are largely dependent on systems integrators  distributors and resellers whose purchases from us have been difficult to predict 
in addition  we believe that many of our larger transactions with the us federal government are dependent on specific projects that may or may not be continued at the same scale in the future due to budgetary cuts or other reasons  and the reduction or cancellation of specific projects such as these may change the buying patterns of the us federal government and could result in our sales to the us government being less than expected 
key components of our results of operations sources of revenue our revenue is primarily comprised of license and maintenance revenue 
we license our software under perpetual licenses  which ordinarily includes one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of the product 
license revenue reflects the revenue recognized from sales of new licenses and upgrades to our software 
we have experienced annual growth in license revenue 
customers can renew  and generally have renewed  their maintenance agreements at our standard list maintenance renewal pricing for their software products 
current customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements when and if they become available 
maintenance revenue is an important source of our future revenue 
we have experienced strong and consistent annual and quarterly growth in maintenance and other revenue 
because our maintenance base grew during  and due to new license sales and high customer retention and acquisitions  we expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase in future periods 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of personnel costs related to providing technical support services and amortization of acquired developed product technologies and third party software licenses 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes for technical support personnel  as well as an allocation of our facilities  information technology and other overhead costs and our employee benefit costs 
we allocate stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes to personnel costs based on the expense category in which the option or restricted stock unit holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent  computer and other technology costs  and employee benefit costs to personnel costs in each expense category based on worldwide headcount in that category 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as we acquire additional companies and integrate the businesses 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into four categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative and accrued earnout gain loss 

table of contents our operating expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract research and development costs  marketing program costs and legal  accounting  consulting and other professional service fees 
personnel costs for each category of operating expenses primarily include employee compensation costs and facility overhead costs 
our operating expenses increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of revenue in compared to and  as we have continued to build infrastructure and add employees through acquisitions and internal growth across all departments in order to accelerate and support our growth 
the number of full time employees as of december   was  as compared to  as of december  and as of december  we will continue to make investments in our business by expanding our direct inside sales force domestically and internationally  increasing our marketing operations and programs and adding research and development personnel worldwide which will increase our operating expenses 
we expect our operating expenses in future periods to continue to increase in absolute dollars and to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as we acquire additional companies and integrate the businesses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales  marketing and business development employees and executives  commissions earned by our sales personnel  the cost of marketing programs such as paid search  search engine optimization and management  trade shows  webinars and the cost of business development programs 
we expect to continue to hire sales personnel in the united states and in our international sales offices 
in  we completed the expansion of our sales offices in singapore and australia which has resulted in and will result in an increase in facilities and personnel costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our website  online user community site and marketing programs to drive customer downloads and support our new product launches 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our product development employees and executives 
we have devoted our development efforts primarily to expanding our product line and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our software products 
since establishing our research and development center in the czech republic and as a result of our acquisitions  we have significantly increased our research and development employee headcount 
as part of our acquisitions  we increased research and development personnel in india and the united states 
we expect to continue to invest in our research and development activities by hiring engineers in the united states and in our international locations 
in  we completed the expansion of our development center in india which has resulted in and will result in an increase in facilities and personnel costs 
this expansion will allow us to continue our research and development growth strategy internationally 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as legal  accounting and other professional service fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect to incur higher administrative costs in future periods as our business continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions 
in addition  we intend to continue to grant equity awards to our current executives and employees and those who join us in the future through acquisitions or otherwise  which will result in additional stock based compensation expense 
accrued earnout gain loss 
accrued earnout gain loss represents the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation recorded on the acquisition date due to subsequent adjustments in the probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the earnout criteria 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains losses  government grant income and acquisition related contingent consideration fair value adjustments due to the passage of time 
interest income represents interest received on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of amortization of prepaid interest 
interest expense in was associated with our outstanding 
table of contents long term debt which was paid in full in may foreign exchange gains losses relate to expenses and billing transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the associated subsidiary 
government grant income is primarily related to grants received by our czech republic entity for the creation of job positions and related training costs 
income tax expense income tax expense primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our software offerings by our united states and irish entities 
the rate of taxation on income earned by our united states entity is higher than the rate of taxation on income earned by our irish entity 
if our international income  as a percentage of total income  increases as we expect  then our effective income tax rate should correspondingly decline 
however  our effective tax rate may be affected by many other factors  such as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  new interpretations of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  the impact of accounting for business combinations  changes in our international structure  shifts in the amount of taxable income earned in the united states  as compared with other regions in the world  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
we benefit from the tax credit incentives under the us research and experimentation tax credit extended to taxpayers engaged in qualified research and experimental activities while carrying on a trade or business 
the tax credit expired on december   and if not renewed under similar terms as in prior years  the result could have a material impact on our financial results 
in and  we received a benefit to our income tax expense from these research and development tax credits of million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states of america generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe certain accounting policies requiring significant management judgment are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgment and estimates 
these critical accounting policies include valuation of goodwill  intangibles  long lived assets and contingent consideration  revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
we must also estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration 
the operating results of acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on significant judgments made by management 
we typically engage third party valuation appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of the assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from management  and also include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows earned from the intangible asset and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
the acquired developed product technologies recorded for each acquisition were feasible at the date of acquisition as they were being actively marketed and sold by the acquired company at the acquisition date 
in addition to the acquired developed product technologies  we also record intangible assets for the acquired company s customer relationships  trademarks and non competition covenants 

table of contents an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment is highly subjective and requires the application of significant judgment 
for purposes of the annual impairment test  we consider our market capitalization compared with the carrying amount of our net assets on the date of the test  since we have only one reporting unit 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  the revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
as of december  and  we performed our annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for our reporting unit during any of the periods presented 
no impairment charges have been required to date 
we evaluate long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets and other assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events or changes in circumstances that could result in an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment or our finite lived intangibles and other assets  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
as of december  and  there were no indicators that our long lived assets were impaired 
contingent consideration 
our acquisitions may include contingent consideration payments based on future sales or product milestones of an acquired entity 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities based on certain milestones of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement and discount the liabilities to present value using a weighted average cost of capital 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  there is significant judgment involved 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities may result from changes in discount periods  changes in the timing and amount of sales and or other specific milestone estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earnout criteria 
at each reporting date  the contingent consideration liability is revalued to estimated fair value and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisitions are reflected in net income in the consolidated statements of income and could cause a material impact to  and volatility in  our operating results 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenue from the licensing of our software products and from the sale of maintenance agreements 
we typically include one year of maintenance as part of the initial purchase price of each software offering and then sell renewals of this maintenance agreement 
in accordance with current guidance  we recognize revenue for software  maintenance and other services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
our return policy generally does not allow our customers to return software offerings 
license revenue 
we consider delivery of our software to have occurred and recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses to our software when risk of loss transfers to the customer or reseller  which is generally upon electronic transfer of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the purchaser 
we sell licenses to our software products through our direct inside sales force and through our distributors and other resellers 
our distributors and resellers do not carry inventory of our software and we generally require them to specify the end user of the software at the time of the order 
if the distributor or reseller does not provide end user information  then we will generally not fulfill the order 
our distributors and resellers have no rights of return or exchange for software that they purchase from us and payment for these purchases is due to us without regard to whether the distributors or resellers collect payment from their customers 

table of contents because our software is generally sold with maintenance  we calculate the amount of revenue allocated to the software license by determining the fair value of the maintenance and subtracting it from the total invoice or contract amount 
we establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of maintenance services by the standard published list pricing for our maintenance renewals since we generally charge list prices for our maintenance renewals 
if in the future we were unable to establish vsoe of fair value of the maintenance or other services we would defer all revenue over the term of the agreement and until all elements of the agreement had been delivered which could significantly impact the timing of our revenue recognition 
maintenance and other revenue 
we derive maintenance revenue from fees for software maintenance services which includes the maintenance portion allocated from the initial license transaction and any subsequent maintenance renewal transactions 
we generally bill maintenance renewal agreements annually in advance for services to be performed over a month period 
customers have the option to purchase maintenance renewals for periods longer than months 
we initially record the amounts to be paid under maintenance agreements as deferred revenue and recognize these amounts ratably on a daily basis over the term of the maintenance agreement 
customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements to new versions of their software products on a when and if available basis 
other revenue consists primarily of training  consulting  subscription and product development services  which is recognized upon delivery of the training or consulting services to the end customer or when the development work is performed 
we establish vsoe of fair value for training through the standard rates we charge for training when sold separately 
other revenue is not currently significant nor do we expect it to be significant in future periods 
stock based compensation we have granted and expect to continue to grant our employees and directors stock based incentive awards 
these awards are in the form of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards on the date of grant 
the fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
we use various assumptions in estimating the fair value of options at the date of grant using the black scholes option model including expected dividend yield  volatility  risk free rate of return and expected life 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock  therefore  we assume the expected dividend yield to be zero 
since we were a private entity prior to our ipo in may with no historical data regarding the volatility of our own common stock price  we based the expected volatility on the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative industry peer group 
we determined expected volatility of options granted using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies 
we based the risk free rate of return on the average us treasury yield curve for five and seven year terms 
as allowed under current guidance  we have elected to apply the simplified method in developing our estimate of expected life for plain vanilla stock options by using the midpoint between the vesting date and contractual termination date since we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded 
for all dates  we granted employees options at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the time of grant  which is the closing price of our common stock as reported by the nyse 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the respective carrying amounts and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 

table of contents the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
at december  and  we had million and million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively  all of which  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
we accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of december  and  there was an insignificant amount accrued for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
in calculating our effective tax rate  we make judgments regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the guidance requires us to identify  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained  or may only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for  and the adequacy of  valuation allowances based on the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we intend either to invest our non us earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our us entities in a tax free manner 
for this reason  we do not record federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries

new license sales in our global commercial business increased and new license sales in our us federal government business increased in as compared to this growth in both businesses was driven by year over year growth in core product transaction volume

our core product transaction growth increased in compared to through the year ended december   the trailing month average transaction size for new license sales was approximately  as compared to approximately  for the month period through the year ended december  we believe that the increase in new license sales and our average transaction size for new license sales resulted from better awareness of our products  an increase in the number of products that we sell primarily as a result of our product development and our acquisitions 
new license sales in our commercial business increased globally while new license sales in our us federal government business decreased in compared to the decline in us federal sales was primarily driven by a reduction in the value of orders received from agencies and groups associated with the department of defense

due to this growth  our personnel costs  which include stock based compensation expense  increased by million in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was due primarily to a decrease of million in legal fees and settlement expenses associated with a claim by a former employee that was settled in december and a million reduction in costs associated with a public offering completed in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by an increase of million in personnel costs  which include stock based compensation expense  million in amortization related to certain intangible assets from tek tools and million in acquisition costs related to the tek tools acquisition 
the decrease was also offset by an increase in other costs such as consulting  director fees  severance costs related to the retirement of our former executive chairman  employee meetings and other miscellaneous administrative and employee expenses 
the increase in stock based compensation expense of million included a one time expense of million from the acceleration of the vesting of certain options related to the retirement of our former executive chairman on june  other income expense interest expense in decreased by million from due to principal payments made in and the outstanding principal balance under our indebtedness was comprised of a first lien note  or first lien note  and a second lien note  or second lien note 
our outstanding principal balance on the notes was million as of december  in march  we prepaid million of principal to repay all of the outstanding principal balance on the first lien note 
in may  we fully repaid the remaining million of principal outstanding on the second lien note 
income tax expense our income tax expense increased by million in compared to this increase resulted from an increase in our income before income taxes of million during the same period 
our effective tax rate 
table of contents increased from in to in primarily as a result of a reduction in permanent us income tax benefits related to the us domestic production activities deduction  and the percentage of our earnings that were generated by our international operations  which are generally taxed at lower corporate tax rates than in the united states  decreased slightly from to non gaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  this form k includes the following financial measures defined as non gaap financial measures by the sec i non gaap operating income  ii non gaap net income  iii non gaap diluted earnings per share  and iv free cash flow 
each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with gaap 
in this report  these non gaap financial measures exclude stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes  amortization of intangible assets  public offering costs  lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees  net of reimbursements  severance costs related to the retirement of our former executive chairman  and acquisition related adjustments  including contingent consideration fair value adjustments due to the changes in probability assumptions of achieving the earnout criteria and due to the passage of time 
each of these non gaap adjustments is described in more detail below 
in addition to these adjustments  management may include or exclude additional items from these or similar non gaap financial measures in future periods 
a reconciliation of each of these non gaap financial measures to its most comparable gaap financial measure is also included below 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude certain amounts that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance  allocating resources  preparing annual budgets and determining employee incentive compensation 
accordingly  these non gaap financial measures may provide insight on the motivation and decision making of management in operating the business 
in addition  by comparing our non gaap financial measures in different historical periods  our investors can evaluate our operating results without the additional variations of certain items that may not be indicative of our core operations  including stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash expense that is not a key measure of our operations 
while we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information  there are limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to their financing and accounting methods  the book value of their assets  their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired 
items such as the amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes and acquisition related adjustments  as well as the related tax impacts of these items can have a material impact on operating and net income 
as a result  these non gaap financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  their most comparable gaap measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using these non gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measure 
investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures below 
non gaap operating income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in the corresponding gaap operating income driven by higher sales volume for the year 
amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related adjustments  which are excluded from our non gaap operating income  also increased for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the increase in intangible assets and acquisition related costs resulting from the various acquisitions completed during refer to note acquisitions of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional acquisition details including the intangibles acquired 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in stock based 
table of contents compensation expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   as the expense and related employer paid payroll taxes includes a one time stock based compensation expense of million from the acceleration of the vesting of certain options related to the retirement of our former executive chairman on june  non gaap net income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increases in the corresponding gaap net income  amortization of intangible assets and acquisition related costs  offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expenses and related employer paid payroll taxes as discussed above in the calculation of non gaap operating income 
other adjustments to non gaap net income include the write off of debt issuance costs  fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration included in acquisition related costs and the tax benefits associated with the excluded items 
non gaap earnings per share increased from at december  to at december  primarily due to the increase in non gaap net income as the number of shares used in the computation did not change significantly 
free cash flow increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in free cash flow from to is primarily due to the increase in operating income that converted to cash flow 
excess tax benefit from stock based compensation decreased in as compared to due to the executive exercises in for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable gaap financial measures  the reasons why management uses these measures and the usefulness of these measures  see items below

we provide non gaap information which excludes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which primarily relate to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
because of varying fair value amounts of intangible assets  subjective impairment assumptions and the variety of useful lives  which affect the recognition of amortization expense  we believe that the exclusion of amortization expense allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions results in our recording expenses in our gaap financial statements that were already expensed by the acquired company before the acquisition and for which we have not expended cash 
accordingly  we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses 
stock based compensation expense and related employer paid payroll taxes 
we provide non gaap information which excludes expenses for stock based compensation and related employer paid payroll taxes 
we believe the exclusion of these items allows for financial results that are more indicative of our continuing operations 
we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies  subjective assumptions and the variety of award types 
employer paid payroll taxes on stock based compensation is dependent on our stock price and the timing of the taxable events related to the equity awards  over which our management has little control  and does not correlate to the core operation of our business 
because of these unique characteristics of stock based compensation and the related employer paid payroll taxes  management excludes these expenses when analyzing the organization s business performance 
other items 
we exclude certain other unplanned items which we believe are not indicative of our continuing operations and which amounts and timing are difficult to estimate in advance  including the following  when applicable i write off of debt issuance costs  ii public offering costs  iii lawsuit settlement costs and related legal fees  net of related reimbursements from insurance proceeds  
table of contents iv severance costs related to retirement of certain executive officers  and v the income tax effect on our financial statements of excluding items related to our non gaap financial measures 
although these events are reflected in our gaap financials  these transactions which are not indicative of our continuing operations may limit the comparability of our ongoing operations with prior and future periods 
we also believe providing financial information with and without the income tax effect of excluding items related to our non gaap financial measures provide our management and users of the financial statements with better clarity regarding the on going performance and future liquidity of our business 
because of these factors  we assess our operating performance both with these amounts included and excluded  and by providing this information  we believe the users of our financial statements are better able to understand the financial results of what we consider our continuing operations 
acquisition related adjustments 
we exclude certain expense items resulting from acquisitions including the following  when applicable i amortization of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions see note for further discussion  ii legal  accounting and advisory fees to the extent associated with acquisitions  iii changes in fair value of contingent consideration  iv costs related to integrating the acquired businesses  and v restructuring costs  including adjustments related to changes in estimates  related to acquisitions 
we consider these adjustments  to some extent  to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control 
furthermore  acquisitions result in non continuing operating expenses  which would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations  with respect to each acquisition 
we believe that providing non gaap information for acquisition related expense items in addition to the corresponding gaap information allows the users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historic and current results of our continuing operations  and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies  both with and without such adjustments 
non gaap diluted earnings per share item 
we provide non gaap diluted earnings per share 
the non gaap diluted earnings per share amount was calculated based on our non gaap net income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period 
the non gaap diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  assumed the conversion of our preferred stock in may occurred as of the beginning of the indicated period 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities plus the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation and less the purchase of property and equipment 
we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure that reflects the cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment that can then be used for  among other things  strategic acquisitions and investments in the business  stock repurchases and funding ongoing operations 
free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period 
the changes in free cash flow result from fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities offset by tax benefits associated with the exercises of options 
for further discussion regarding cash flows from operating activities  see the discussion under the caption liquidity and capital resources included in this item liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of december   approximately million of which was held as cash and cash equivalents by our international subsidiaries 
as of december   of these cash and cash equivalents held by our international subsidiaries were in euros 
we currently intend that the earnings generated by our international operations will be invested indefinitely in those operations and we do not expect to repatriate those earnings to our domestic operations 
if we were to try and repatriate these earnings  we would incur a us federal income tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements 
our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits  money market funds and highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at december  we began purchasing short term 
table of contents investments  classified as available for sale securities  during these short term investments consisted primarily of corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper held in investment accounts in the united states 
our money market mutual funds invest in high quality  short term securities 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal while secondarily maximizing yield on those funds 
the balances held in our deposit accounts in the united states may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  insurance limits or may not be insured by the fdic 
while we monitor the balances in our accounts  and adjust the balances as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the underlying depository institutions or the guarantors fail or could be subject to adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we strive to maintain our cash deposits  money market funds and investments with multiple financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore  bear minimal credit risk 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash  cash equivalents  and investments  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the future 
summarized annual cash flow information is as follows in thousands year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is comprised of net income  adjustments for non cash operating activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
adjustments for non cash benefits expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these adjustments primarily consist of stock based compensation expense  excess tax benefits related to employee stock based awards and depreciation and amortization 
we also recognized a gain on the change in the fair value of the hyper acquisition accrued earnout of million for the year ended december  due to an adjustment in the probability assumption of achieving the earnout criteria 
in addition  non cash expenses in included million of expenses paid by a stockholder in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit with a former employee 
the change in cash flows relating to operating activities resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities and is primarily driven by sales of our software offerings and maintenance renewals 
the significant components of our cash flows from operating activities include the following accounts receivables increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  resulting in an increase in operating assets and reflecting a cash outflow of million for the year ended december  the increase in accounts receivable for the years ended december  and as compared to the respective prior year resulted in cash outflows of million and million  respectively 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period depending on the timing of our sales  cash collections and changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
our accounts receivable balance represents trade receivables from customers when we have provided software licenses and or software maintenance agreements and we have not yet received payment 
we have historically had insignificant write offs related to bad debts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on a quarterly basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we 
table of contents define dso as a accounts receivable divided by b total revenue for the most recent quarter  multiplied by c the number of days in the quarter 
our dso was days at december  deferred revenue increased to million at december  as compared to million at december   resulting in an increase in operating liabilities and reflecting a cash inflow of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased million and million due to an increase in deferred revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in deferred revenue was due primarily to the increase in sales of our software offerings and maintenance renewals 
changes in our income tax receivable and payable balances are also significant components of our cash flows from operating activities 
the increase in our income tax payable was primarily due to our operating growth in fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities was reduced by income tax payments of million in  was increased by a us federal income tax refund of million in and reduced by income tax payments of million in other changes in operating assets and liabilities include cash paid for interest payments of million and million in and  respectively  along with million in legal fees and settlement expenses  net of insurance reimbursements  paid by us in connection with the settlement of our lawsuit with a former employee in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to million of cash used for acquisitions refer to note acquisitions of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details and million of cash used to purchase available for sale securities classified as short term investments 
also during  we had million of proceeds from maturities of short term investments and paid million of cash to tek tools upon the achievement of certain performance criteria related to the asset acquisition in january this contingent consideration was recorded at fair value in the first quarter of as an accrued acquisition earnout of million and is reflected in cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration of million due to the passage of time was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  and is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to the million of cash used in our purchase of certain assets of tek tools and million of purchases of property and equipment for operations 
cash used in investing activities in was primarily for purchase of software licenses and tools  computers and equipment  furniture and fixtures as we expanded our infrastructure and workforce 
we estimate our capital expenditures for to be approximately million  comprised primarily of computer equipment  software  additional leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
the estimated capital expenditures for include costs related to the expected expansion of our ireland  india and czech republic offices 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the excess tax benefit related to stock based awards of million  which is a reduction in cash payments related to income taxes 
net cash used in financing activities in was due to a million repayment of long term debt partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a million excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation  which is a reduction in cash payments related to income taxes 
the debt payments in paid off our entire outstanding principal under our first lien note and second lien note 

table of contents on august   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program  authorizing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the share repurchase program was completed in august  and we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the repurchase was authorized to reflect the confidence of management and the board of directors in our business 
we believed the share repurchase program would generate a positive return to our shareholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding 
given the low rates of return on cash and short term investments and as there was no outstanding debt at the time of the share repurchase  we believed the share repurchase program was a proper use of our available cash 
net cash provided by financing activities in was due to the net cash proceeds from our ipo of million  after deducting underwriter discounts and commissions but before other offering costs  million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the excess tax benefit related to employee stock option exercises of million 
these proceeds were offset by million in repayments of long term debt pursuant to our first lien note and million of payments for offering costs made during we also made a one time earnout payment pursuant to an agreement with our original stockholders of million in november this million payment  which was treated as a dividend payment pursuant to applicable accounting rules  was reflected in our consolidated statements of changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity deficit as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of any acquisitions to expand our business  the timing of introductions of new software products and enhancements to existing software products  and the continuing market acceptance of our software offerings 
although we are not currently a party to any material definitive agreement regarding potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  applications or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements  which could reduce our cash and cash equivalents  require us to seek additional equity or debt financing or repatriate cash generated by our international operations that would cause us to incur a us federal income tax liability 
additional funds from financing arrangements may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments as of december  consisted of operating lease obligations for our office facilities 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december   that require us to make future cash payments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations accrued earnout total purchase obligations represent purchases of software license and support fees  marketing activities  accounting  legal and contractor fees  corporate health insurance costs and computer hardware and software 
we acquired hyper in january the purchase agreement included contingent consideration ranging from to million based on sales milestones for fiscal year in february  we paid 
table of contents approximately million of cash upon the achievement of these sales milestones 
the payment is recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  as an accrued acquisition earnout of million 
we have excluded long term tax liabilities of million at december  related to uncertain tax positions from the amounts presented as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known 
off balance sheet arrangements during  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  including the following interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and available for sale securities classified as short term investments totaling million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank deposits and money market funds  and our available for sale securities consist primarily of corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper held in investment accounts in the united states 
we hold cash  cash equivalents and short term available for sale securities for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes  and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to our cash and cash equivalents  as these consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less at december  our portfolio of available for sale securities classified as investments is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could impact our future investment income  or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our investment securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
foreign currency risk as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our revenue from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  the foreign currencies that we invoice and on which we collect are the euro  british pound sterling  australian dollar and japanese yen 
expenses incurred by our international subsidiaries are  generally  denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary 
our consolidated statements of income are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international operations if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 

table of contents during  we did not enter into forward exchange contracts or any other similar contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on our earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  we began utilizing purchased foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on certain non functional foreign currency balance sheet positions 
there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuation in currency exchange rates on our results of operational and functional positions 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into u 
s dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity deficit
