critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses 
our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party  if any  has the power and benefits 
therefore  we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we  or another party  have the power to direct these activities 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 
revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 

table of contents nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series schedules 
event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event as a component of its sanction fees 
the promoter records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors 
ultimately  the promoter retains percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative selling price 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar and grand american series 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with asc  business combinations  are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin  and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets which could be subject to impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million as an impairment of long lived assets primarily attributable to the reduction of the carrying value of our staten island property and impairment charges relating to certain other long lived assets 

table of contents in fiscal  we recorded a before tax charge of approximately million as an impairment of long lived assets primarily attributable to the non cash impairment of certain costs related to the daytona development project and removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment totaling approximately million  as an impairment of long lived assets  primarily attributable to the removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 
as of november   goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment accounts for approximately  million  or percent of our total assets 
we account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc and for our long lived assets in accordance with asc we follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually 
we complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance  supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future as further described in risk factors  our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations 
despite the current adverse economic trends  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment  which have contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports entertainment events since fiscal  we believe there has been no significant change in the long term fundamentals of our ongoing motorsports event business 
we believe our present operational and cash flow outlook further support our conclusion 
in connection with our fiscal assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above 
we believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were appropriate  relevant  and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes 
our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units  except for one reporting unit 
the estimated fair value for this one reporting unit  which has goodwill of less than million  exceeded the carrying value by less than percent as determined using our internal discounted cash flow methodology 
we believe the most recent comparable market transactions would support a substantially higher valuation 
in addition  our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities 
in these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee  which adds an additional element of risk that can adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
the carrying value of our equity investments was million at november  income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc  income taxes 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with 
table of contents tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business  we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
equity and other investments hollywood casino at kansas speedway in february  kansas entertainment  llc  kansas entertainment a joint venture of penn and kansas speedway development corporation ksdc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of isc  received the final approval under the kansas expanded lottery act  along with its gaming license from the kansas racing and gaming commission  to proceed with the construction of the hollywood themed and branded destination entertainment facility  overlooking turn two of kansas speedway 
kansas entertainment began construction of the facility in april which is scheduled to open on february  the initial phase of the hollywood casino at kansas speedway features a  square foot casino with  slot machines and table games including poker tables  a  space parking structure as well as a sports themed bar  dining and entertainment options 
kansas entertainment is funding the initial phase of the development with equity contributions from each partner 
ksdc and penn will share equally in the cost of developing and constructing the facility 
we currently estimate that our share of capitalized development costs for the project  excluding our contribution of land  will be approximately million 
through november   we have funded approximately million of these capitalized development costs and expect to fund the remaining amount through the opening of the casino 
in addition  we expect to fund certain working capital needs of the project prior to opening 
also  we will continue to incur certain other start up and related costs through opening  which will be expensed through equity in net loss from equity investments 
penn is the managing member of kansas entertainment and is responsible for the development and operation of the casino 
we have accounted for kansas entertainment as an equity investment in our financial statements as of november  our percent portion of kansas entertainment s net loss was approximately million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  related to certain start up costs  and is included in equity in net loss from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
there were no operations included in our consolidated statements of operations in the same period in fiscal staten island property in connection with our efforts to develop a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area  our wholly owned indirect subsidiary  development  purchased a total of acres located in the new york city borough of staten island in early fiscal and began improvements including fill operations on the property 
in december  we announced our decision to discontinue pursuit of the speedway development on staten island 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined  based on our understanding of the real estate market  that the current carrying value of the property was in excess of the fair market value 
as a result  we recognized a non cash  pre tax charge in our results of approximately million  or per diluted share  which is included in the motorsports event segment 
in october  we entered into  and subsequently amended  an agreement agreement with kb marine holdings llc kb holdings under which kb holdings would acquire percent of the outstanding equity membership interests of development 
upon execution of the agreement  isc received a non refundable million payment 
the most recent amendment reflected a total purchase price of approximately million 
we expected that the proceeds from the sale  net of applicable broker commissions and other closing costs would have resulted in an immaterial gain on the transaction upon closing 

table of contents on december   we announced the termination of the amended agreement with kb holdings for the sale of the interests in development 
kb holdings did not fulfill the terms of the amended agreement to close the transaction on or before november  we are currently pursuing further discussions with kb holdings as well as alternative buyers for the interests in development 
on march   the new york state department of environmental conservation dec published for public comment a series of documents  including an engineering work plan  which will allow the property to be filled 
the dec received comments and subsequently finalized the engineering work plan  as well as a modified order on consent and other related documents 
execution of these documents will allow the property to be filled and remaining environmental remediation to be completed  both of which are necessary precursors for commercial development of the property 
we believe this is an important step in the development of the property and its potential to bring jobs and economic development to staten island 
currently we do not anticipate that the dec documents will be signed or that filling activities will commence until after we have sold our interest in development 
motorsports authentics we are partners with speedway motorsports  inc in a joint venture  smisc  llc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc conducts business under the name motorsports authentics 
ma designs  promotes  markets and distributes motorsports licensed merchandise 
in fiscal  ma management and ownership considered various approaches to optimize performance in ma s various distribution channels 
as the challenges were assessed  it became apparent that there was significant risk in future business initiatives in mass apparel  memorabilia and other yet to be developed products 
these initiatives had previously been deemed achievable and were included in projections that supported the carrying value of inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets on ma s balance sheet 
this analysis  combined with a long term macroeconomic outlook that was less robust than previously expected  triggered ma s review of certain assets under asc and asc and our evaluation under asc as a result of the foregoing which triggered our evaluation performed under asc we recognized significant impairments of our equity investment in ma during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting in a reduction to the carrying value of our investment in ma to zero at november  ma s management  with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm  completed its review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  concluding that the fair value of ma s goodwill and intangible assets should be reduced to zero 
we did not recognize any net income or loss from operations of ma during fiscal or  respectively 
our percent portion of ma s fiscal net loss is approximately million  or per diluted share  which included the aforementioned impairment charges 
we have a guaranty exposure to one nascar team licensor which will be satisfied upon ma making certain payments to the team through january as of november   our guaranty exposure was approximately million 
while it is possible that some obligation under this guarantee may occur in the future  the amount we will ultimately pay cannot be estimated at this time 
in any event  we do not believe that the ultimate financial outcome will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes the tax treatment of providing a valuation allowance related to losses incurred by our motorsports authentics equity investment  partially offset by the reduction in income taxes due to the interest income related to our settlement with the internal revenue service  are the principal causes of the increased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  the de recognition of potential interest and penalties associated with certain state settlements as well as certain state credits accrued are the principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  as a result of the above items  our effective income tax rate increased from the statutory income rate to approximately percent for the fiscal year ended november   and decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately percent for the fiscal year ended november  
table of contents current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
future trends in operating results economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that unprecedented adverse economic trends  particularly the decline in consumer confidence  affected the frequency with which our guests choose to visit our major motorsports facilities 
this significantly contributed to the decreased level of attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events since the start of the recession in absent a sustained improvement in consumer confidence that includes an increase in discretionary spending  we expect certain of these adverse trends to persist through fiscal  which can have an impact on our business  especially attendance related and corporate partner revenues 
mitigating the potential decline in certain revenue categories  are cost containment initiatives that have already been implemented 
while these initiatives have had  and are expected to continue to have  a positive impact on our financial position  the company does not have significant additional incremental costs that can be reduced without materially altering the way it operates 
admissions an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities 
by effectively managing ticket prices and seating capacity  we have historically shown the ability to stimulate ticket renewals and advance ticket sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual  as well as forecasted  inclement weather on ticket sales 
with any ticketing program  we first examine our ticket pricing structure at each of our major motorsports facilities to ensure that prices are in line with market demand 
when determined necessary  we will adjust ticket pricing 
it is important that we maintain the integrity of our pricing model by rewarding our best and loyal customers 
we do not adjust pricing downward inside of the sales cycle and avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
further  we limit and monitor the availability of promotional tickets 
all of these factors could have a detrimental effect on our pricing model and long term value of our business 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
however  at certain of our motorsports facilities  after the renewal period ends  we have gradually increased the ticket price up to event day to maximize revenue 
during this period of reduced consumer confidence  we have experienced compressed sales cycles for our events as our customers are making ticket purchasing decisions closer to the event date 
to address this and to be sensitive to the economic challenges that many of our fans faced  in and  we reduced pricing for our major events as well as unbundled a substantial number of tickets to better respond to consumer demand 
for the season  we believe these ticket pricing initiatives already implemented were aligned with demand  providing attractive price points for all income levels 
we expect to maintain our current ticket pricing strategies for the upcoming season  adjusting pricing only in targeted areas within our motorsports facilities 
in addition to adjusting ticket pricing when appropriate  we are also motivating our customers to renew early with various incentives as well as special access privileges 
adjusting sellable seating capacity at our major motorsports facilities that host nascar sprint cup series events is another initiative designed to regain a more normalized advance ticket sales trend 
since fiscal  we have reduced sellable capacity by approximately percent 
the reduction of sellable capacity  which is primarily achieved by providing improved and wider seating for our fans  is enhancing the overall guest experience 
any further reduction in capacity will be incremental as we gradually improve seating at our facilities 
we have been actively pursuing new customers through various segmented marketing programs 
we have expanded our youth initiatives to encourage families to attend 
in many instances  children and under are admitted free with a ticketed adult 
the younger demographic is our next generation race fan 
to market to this demographic  traditional means of advertising may not be adequate to reach them effectively 
other mediums  primarily social media channels  more effectively reach and resonate with the youth segment 
based on a consumer engagement study  more than percent of all fans now get nascar related information from social media channels 
as such  we are actively involved in creating compelling interactive digital experiences with current and potential fans through these channels 
in addition  we are implementing programs aimed at engaging first time race fans to educate them on getting the most out of the experience and a better understanding of the sport 

table of contents corporate partnerships we believe that our presence in key metropolitan statistical areas  year round event schedule  impressive portfolio of major motorsports events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships 
our corporate sales team continues to generate strong levels of interest from corporate prospects 
economic trends experienced since have influenced corporate budgets  sales and contract duration 
beginning in  we have seen pricing stabilization for many of our inventory of assets 
for fiscal  we sold all of our nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event entitlements 
entering into the season  we have more available inventory than in previous years due to the shorter duration of contracted terms 
we expect  based on current interest and demand  that we will secure all of our nascar sprint cup and nationwide series event entitlements 
we believe that revenues from our corporate marketing relationships will grow over the long term  contributing to strong earnings and cash flow stability and predictability 
in a positive development for the sport  nascar and sprint signed a multi year agreement  extending sprint s role as title sponsor of nascar through the season 
sprint is the largest sponsor in the sport and this extension is a big win for the industry 
television broadcast and ancillary media rights domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues are an important component of our revenue and earnings stream 
starting in  nascar entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its three national touring series sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck 
the agreements total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and will be approximately million for  million for  and  million for fox and tnt have been strong supporters of nascar racing since  and both have played a major role in the sport s climb in popularity 
we have  and expect to continue to see  ongoing broadcast innovation in their coverage of nascar racing events 
also notable was the return of espn to the sport in  which it helped build throughout the s and s 
espn s coverage and weekly ancillary nascar related programming continues to promote the sport across its various channels 
further  espn broadcasts substantially the entire abc espn inventory of nascar sprint cup and nationwide series events  providing these series with the continuity and promotional support that we believe will allow them to flourish 
espn  with a subscriber base at approximately million homes  has the ability to attract younger viewers as well as create more exposure for the sport 
cable broadcasters can typically support a higher investment due to subscriber fees that are not available to traditional networks  which is a potential benefit when nascar negotiates the next consolidated domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights contract 
while the media landscape continues to evolve  we believe nascar s position in the sports and entertainment industry remains strong 
the nascar sprint cup series remains the second highest rated regular season sport on television 
for the season  an average of million households and million viewers tuned into each nascar sprint cup series event  an increase of approximately percent and percent  respectively  over fiscal also  over million unique viewers tuned into a nascar sprint cup series event  and on average per event  nascar has the second largest number of viewers and people watching together as well as the largest percentage of female viewers 
the nascar sprint cup series is the number two sport among all key demographic groups  trailing only the nfl 
this past year saw the key demographic group  the to year old male  increase viewership by percent from last season 
in addition  the nascar nationwide series is the second highest rated motorsports series on television and the nascar camping world truck series is the third highest rated motorsports series on cable television 
these solid ratings and results  we believe  puts nascar in a strong negotiating position for the next broadcast media rights agreements 
we also benefit from nascar s ancillary rights agreements for which we receive a share of contracted revenues from various partners such as turner sports nascar 
com and siriusxm radio 
through ancillary rights sharing we receive  at times  revenues for international broadcasting  nascar images  specialty pay per view telecasts and other media content distribution 
the various contracted agreements are negotiated separately by nascar  and vary in terms and duration 

table of contents siriusxm radio has been the most significant contributor to the industry s ancillary rights revenue 
in  sirius satellite radio  the predecessor to siriusxm radio  entered into a five year agreement to be nascar s exclusive satellite radio partner 
since entering into the contract  sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio merged to form sirius xm radio 
prior to this merger  both were actively competing against each other for the distribution rights for original programming thereby increasing the pricing of these rights 
with the merger completed in and only one satellite provider bidding  distribution rights agreements entered into currently have generally been lower 
this is the case with the agreement nascar recently executed for siriusxm radio to continue as the exclusive satellite rights provider for nascar 
for  the industry will receive approximately million in these ancillary rights fees of which we will receive approximately million 
however  we expect to receive an immaterial amount of ancillary revenue in  due primarily to the following factors the aforementioned lower future rights fees received from sirius xm radio  and in order to achieve optimal exploitation of online content  we believe nascar should negotiate a buy out of the remaining two years of turner sports exclusive rights to all nascar related online content 
domestic broadcast media rights fees provide significant cash flow visibility to us  race teams and nascar over the contract term 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted at our wholly owned facilities under these agreements  and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue  were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
operating income generated by these media rights were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are amounts equal to percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events  as part of prize and point fund money see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to materially decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
sanctioning bodies our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal nascar continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of their portfolio of nascar sprint cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
we believe that realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
capital improvements enhancing the live event experience for our guest is a critical strategy for future growth 
we are convinced that our focus on driving incremental earnings by improving the fan experience will lead to increased ticket sales  better pricing power  and greater potential to capture market share  in the long term 
we compete for the consumers discretionary dollar with other entertainment options such as concerts and other major sporting events not just motorsport events 
to better meet our customer s expectations  we are committed to improving the guest experience through on going capital improvements at our facilities to better position the company for long term growth 
today s consumer wants easy access into and out of a venue  comfortable and wider seating  clean and available facilities  enhanced audio and visual engagement  and social connectivity 
we also anticipate modest capital spending on other projects for maintenance  safety and regulatory requirements 
we are confident that by delivering memorable guest experiences  along with attractive pricing and fantastic racing  we will generate stronger attendance related revenues  as well as bottom line results 
while we focus on allocating our capital to generate returns in 
table of contents excess of our cost of capital  certain of these capital improvement investments may not provide immediate  directly traceable positive returns on invested capital but will better enable us to effectively compete with other entertainment venues for consumer and corporate spending 
we are currently assessing the feasibility of increasing our capital spending at existing facilities above recent levels beginning in any increased spending above recent levels will depend upon several factors such as a stable economic operating environment  credit availability  and  preferably  the sale of our staten island property 
growth strategies our growth strategies also include exploring ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions and external developments that offer attractive financial returns 
this has been demonstrated through our joint venture to develop and operate a hollywood themed and branded casino and entertainment destination facility overlooking turn two of kansas speedway see hollywood casino at kansas speedway with penn 
the initial phase of the hollywood casino at kansas speedway features a  square foot casino with  slot machines and table games including poker tables  a  space parking structure as well as a sports themed bar  dining and entertainment options 
the hollywood casino at kansas speedway  which is scheduled to open on february   will have incredible views of the kansas speedway and be a great amenity during race weekends 
both the kansas speedway and the hollywood casino at kansas speedway will benefit year round from the overall appeal of the local entertainment zone which surrounds the complex and features many prominent shopping and leisure activities 
this area which is part of the kansas city metropolitan statistical area currently attracts over million visitors annually  making it one of biggest draws in the region 
we currently estimate that our share of capitalized development costs for the project  excluding our contribution of land  remains at approximately million 
through november   we have funded approximately million of these capitalized development costs and expect to fund the remaining amount through the opening of the casino 
we expect to fund certain working capital needs of the project prior to opening 
also  we will continue to incur certain other start up and related costs through opening  which will be expensed as equity in net loss from equity investments 
we have funded our portion of the capitalized development costs and other start up and related costs with existing cash and from funds drawn on our revolving credit facility due to favorable borrowing terms 
we will continue to fund the remaining portion of capitalized development costs  certain working capital needs  and certain other start up and related costs on our revolving credit facility 
it is our expectation that we will be pay down the borrowings on our revolving credit facility that we associate with the hollywood casino at kansas speedway from our portion of its cash flow 
we expect that the hollywood casino at kansas speedway will provide positive cash flow to us beginning in our fiscal second quarter and expect for the full fiscal year to result in break even to slightly positive equity income in our consolidated income statement 
while this is the first venture in our market based real estate strategy to monetize our real estate through ancillary development  we are confident that this project will create significant value for our shareholders 
we are interested in replicating further ancillary development at certain of our other motorsports facilities 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events we promote outdoor motorsports entertainment events 
weather conditions affect sales of  among other things  tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at these events 
poor weather conditions prior to an event  or even the forecast of poor weather conditions  could have a negative impact on us  particularly for walk up ticket sales to events which are not sold out in advance 
if an event scheduled for one of our facilities is delayed or postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in the united states following the september  terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we would incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including any live broadcast revenues  associated with the event to the extent such losses were not covered by insurance

as a result of the foregoing  net income increased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources general we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities  and return of capital through payments of an annual cash dividend and repurchase of our shares under our stock purchase plan 
in addition  we have used the proceeds from offerings of our class a common stock  the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects 
at november   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million  million principal amount of senior notes outstanding  million in borrowings on our million revolving credit facility  a debt service funding commitment of approximately million principal amount related to the taxable special obligation revenue tif bonds issued by the unified government of wyandotte county kansas city  kansas unified government  million principal term loan related to our headquarters office building the international motorsports center  or imc  and million principal amount of other third party debt 
at november   we had working capital of million  primarily supported by million of cash and cash equivalents 
at november   we had working capital of million  which was anchored by million of cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents our liquidity is primarily generated from our ongoing motorsports operations  and we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future 
in addition  as of november   we have approximately million available to draw upon under our million revolving credit facility  if needed 
see future liquidity for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity 
allocation of capital is driven by our long term strategic planning and initiatives that encompass our mission  vision and values 
our primary uses of capital are to maintain modest debt levels that are consistent with our current investment grade debt rating from moody s and standard and poor s 
we will invest in our facilities to improve the guest experience and we will make investments in strategic projects that complement our core business and provide value for our shareholders  all of which is balanced with returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 
during fiscal year  our significant cash flow items include the following net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  capital expenditures totaling approximately million  net proceeds of million related to long term debt  net payments of million related to our credit facility  contributions to the hollywood casino at kansas speedway joint venture  totaling approximately million  and dividends paid and reacquisitions of previously issued common stock totaling approximately million

the remaining balance of approximately million was associated with other land purchases as well as the staten island property 
in comparison  capital expenditures for fiscal totaled approximately million  which included approximately million of projects at our existing facilities and approximately million in long term restricted cash used for the international motorsports center construction 
at november   we have approximately million remaining in capital projects currently approved for our existing facilities 
these projects include the track repaving  reconfiguration and road course construction at kansas  grandstand seating enhancements at talladega and watkins glen  parking improvements at daytona  trackside rv development at michigan  improvements at various facilities for expansion of parking  camping capacity and other uses  and a variety of other improvements and renovations to our facilities that enable us to effectively compete with other sports venues for consumer and corporate spending 
as a result of these currently approved projects and anticipated additional approvals in fiscal  we expect our total fiscal capital expenditures at our existing facilities will be approximately million to million depending on the timing of certain projects 
we review the capital expenditure program periodically and modify it as required to meet current business needs 
future liquidity general as discussed in future trends in operating results  economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  credit availability  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly the sustained level of high unemployment and decreased consumer confidence significantly contributed to the level of attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during the recession beginning in absent a sustained 
table of contents improvement in consumer confidence that includes an increase discretionary spending  we expect certain of these adverse trends to persist through fiscal  which we expect to have an impact on our business  especially attendance related and corporate partner revenues 
this may negatively impact year over year comparability for our revenue categories for the full year  with the exception of domestic broadcast media rights fees 
our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments and any related redemption premiums  any equity contributions in connection with the hollywood casino at kansas speedway  annual dividend payment  and payments for share repurchases under our stock purchase plan 
we remain interested in pursuing acquisition and or development opportunities that would increase shareholder value  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  over the longer term we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors 
in addition to local  national  and global economic and financial market conditions  consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow

hollywood casino at kansas speedway in february  kansas entertainment  a joint venture of penn and ksdc  received the final approval under the kansas expanded lottery act  along with its gaming license from the kansas racing and gaming commission  to proceed with the construction of the hollywood themed and branded destination entertainment facility  overlooking turn two of kansas speedway 
kansas entertainment began construction of the facility in april which is scheduled to open on february  
table of contents the initial phase of the hollywood casino at kansas speedway features a  square foot casino with  slot machines and table games including poker tables  a  space parking structure as well as a sports themed bar  dining and entertainment options 
kansas entertainment is funding the initial phase of the development with equity contributions from each partner 
ksdc and penn will share equally in the cost of developing and constructing the facility 
we currently estimate that our share of capitalized development costs for the project  excluding our contribution of land  will be approximately million 
through november   we have funded approximately million of these capitalized development costs and expect to fund the remaining amount through the opening of the casino 
in addition  we expect to fund certain working capital needs of the project prior to opening 
also  we will continue to incur certain other start up and related costs through opening  which will be expensed through equity in net loss from equity investments 
penn is the managing member of kansas entertainment and is responsible for the development and operation of the casino 
daytona development project we are exploring development of a mixed use entertainment destination development on acres located  directly across from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility  on international speedway boulevard 
the initial development includes our approximately  square foot office building  the international motorsports center  completed in november the imc houses the headquarters of isc  nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
the imc was financed in july through a million construction term loan obtained by our wholly owned subsidiary  which was created to own and operate the office building 
approved land use entitlements for the remaining project allow for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area  plus a hotel  residential and additional office space 
development of the balance of the project is dependent on several factors  including lease arrangements  availability of project financing and overall market conditions 
while we continue to believe that a mixed use retail dining entertainment area located across from our daytona facility will be a successful project  given the current economic conditions and the uncertainty associated with the future  development of the project will depend on its economic feasibility 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and earnings

for those reporting units  entities are required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test additional testing to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and the amount of such impairment  if any if it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether any adverse qualitative factors indicate that impairment may exist 
these qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendment does not provide guidance on how to determine carrying amounts or measure reporting unit fair value 
any resulting goodwill impairment upon adoption of this guidance should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our financial statement presentation and will adopt the provision of this statement in fiscal in september  fasb issued accounting standards update no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the objective of this update is to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previous guidance under topic required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap and lock agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps and locks are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate as well as to lock in certain rates for future debt issuances 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we had approximately million of variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately million 
at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
