overview we were founded in as a provider of content delivery network services to deliver digital content over the internet 
we began development of our infrastructure in and began generating meaningful revenue in today  we operate a globally distributed  high performance computing platform our global computing platform upon which we provide an integrated suite of services including content delivery services  web content management services  video content management services  web acceleration services  mobility and monetization services  cloud storage services and related consulting services 
our web content management and video content management services are provided as software as a service saas solutions  our cloud storage services and content delivery services are provided as a platform as a service paas solutions and we sometimes refer to all of these integrated services and solutions other than content delivery services collectively as our value added services vas 
we derive revenue from the sale of services to our customers 
our scalable cloud solutions improve the quality of online media and content  accelerate the performance of web applications  enable secure online transactions and manage and monetize digital assets 
these services are provided in the cloud as they are supported by our global computing platform  which provides highly available  highly redundant storage  bandwidth and computing resources as well as connectivity to last mile broadband network providers 
we also offer other platform and infrastructure services  such as transit and rack space services 
we operate in one industry segment 
our services enable global businesses to build and manage their digital presence across internet  mobile and social channels by reaching and delivering a brilliant experience to their audiences on mobile and connected devices  enabling them to enhance their brand presence  build stronger customer relationships  manage web content and video assets  analyze viewer preferences  optimize their advertising  and monetize their digital assets 
we provide services to customers in north america  emea  and the asia pacific region 
as of december   we had approximately  active customers worldwide 

table of contents in addition to expanding our suite of value added services  we have also continued to expand the capacity and capabilities  and to enhance the performance and efficiency of our global computing platform 
although we believe that we may have improved margins in our content delivery services as we expand our customer base and use a greater proportion of our capacity  we expect the majority of our margin increases to result from our value added services increasing as a percentage of our revenue 
on september   our board of directors approved a repurchase plan in compliance with rules b and b of the securities exchange act of that authorizes us to repurchase up to million of our shares of common stock  exclusive of any commissions  markups or expenses  from time to time through march  any repurchased shares will be cancelled and return to authorized but unissued status 
during the year ended december   we repurchased and cancelled approximately million shares at an average price per share of approximately per share 
the price range of the shares repurchased was between and per share 
the total amount expended before commissions  markups and expenses was approximately million 
on september   we completed the sale of eyewonder llc and chors gmbh video and rich media advertising services eyewonder and chors to dg fastchannel  inc dg now digital generation  inc 
for net proceeds of million million gross cash proceeds less million held in escrow plus an estimated million receivable 
accordingly  the results related to the sale of eyewonder and chors for the year ended december  and prior periods have been reclassified to discontinued operations and have not been included in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at the time of purchase  we were pursuing a strategy of business growth through our core content delivery services and our value added services offerings which through the acquisition provided us access directly to the rich media advertising market 
rich media refers to online advertising that uses a range of interactive digital media  including streaming video and audio 
we subsequently determined to concentrate our value added services in mobility  web and video content management  web application acceleration  cloud storage  and consulting which we collectively refer to as our software as a service solutions saas 
this divestiture will enable us to focus on continuing to grow and invest in our globally distributed computing platform and our rapidly expanding saas solutions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information about the sale of eyewonder and chors rich media advertising services 
on march   we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock  including  shares subject to the underwriters over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share 
the newly issued common shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market on march  we raised a total of approximately million in gross proceeds from the offering  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million and other offering costs of approximately million 
the offering was made pursuant to the effective registration statement on form s registration statement no 
previously filed with and declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec on november  and the related prospectus supplement thereunder filed with the sec on february  on may   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of clickability  inc clickability  a privately held saas provider of web content management located in san francisco  california 
this transaction created the foundation for our web content management services 
the aggregate purchase price consisted of approximately million of cash paid at the closing cash paid net of cash acquired was million  million held by us to cover future claims and  shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of approximately million on the date of acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information about our clickability acquisition 

table of contents on may   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of acceloweb  il ltd 
acceloweb  a tel aviv  israel based privately held provider of advanced technology that helps speed the presentation of websites and applications 
this transaction created the foundation for our web acceleration services 
the aggregate purchase price consisted of approximately million of cash paid at the closing cash paid net of cash acquired was million and  shares of our common stock issued at closing with an estimated fair value of approximately million on the acquisition date 
in addition  the purchase price included contingent consideration with an aggregate potential value of million million payable in cash and million payable in the company s common stock  which may be earned upon the achievement of certain performance milestones which will be measured quarterly during the eight full consecutive quarters ending june  the earn out 
the fair value of the earn out was determined to be approximately million  which is comprised of million payable in cash the cash earn out and million payable in common stock the common stock earn out 
the carrying value of the earn out is accreted to its estimated redemption value with a charge to interest expense

table of contents traffic on our network and our value added services business has continued to grow 
this traffic growth is primarily the result of growth in the traffic delivered to existing customers and to a lesser extent on behalf of new customers 
our content delivery revenue is generated by charging for traffic delivered 
while our traffic continued to grow  our revenue generated from such traffic grew at a much slower rate as a result of unit price compression 
our value added services revenue represented substantially all of our revenue growth during the year ended december  during  we added new customers through new business and through our business acquisitions  and we also elected not to renew some customers 
our average number of products per customer during the three month period ended december  was our international revenue has continued its growth  and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on our strategy of expanding our network and customer base internationally 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  revenue derived from customers outside north america accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we derived approximately  and  respectively of our international revenue from emea and approximately  and  respectively of our international revenue from asia pacific 
we anticipate that our asia pacific revenue may continue to grow as a percentage of our total international revenue 
no single country outside of the united states accounted for or more of our revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect foreign revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars in our business is managed as a single segment  and we report our financial results on this basis 
during any given fiscal period  a relatively small number of customers typically account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
for example  in  sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
during and  revenue generated from sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during  we had one customer  netflix  who represented more than of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   netflix represented approximately of our total revenue 
during  we had no customer that accounted for more than of our total revenue 
during we had one customer  microsoft  who represented more than of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   microsoft represented approximately of our total revenue 
we anticipate our top customer concentration levels will be consistent with in addition to selling to our direct customers  we maintain relationships with a number of resellers that purchase our services for resale to their end customers 
revenue generated from sales to reseller customers was approximately  and  respectively of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to these revenue related business trends  our cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of revenue in when compared to for the year ended december   cost of revenue included approximately eight months of cost of revenue for clickability and acceloweb  respectively 
we acquired each company in may the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased bandwidth and co location fees which included increased peering costs  due to increased traffic and expansion of our global computing platform  increased depreciation expense on our network equipment  as we continue to build out our expanding network and refresh our network equipment  and increased payroll and related employee costs for operations personnel  who are responsible for managing and monitoring our global computing platform and delivery of our value added services 
we enter into contracts with third party network and data center providers  with terms typically ranging from several months to several years 
our contracts related to transit bandwidth provided by network operators generally commit us to pay either a fixed monthly fee or monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above a contracted level 
in march and january and september  we entered into multi year arrangements with global crossing for additional bandwidth and backbone capacity 
the agreements required us to make advanced payments for future services to be received 
our recently amended master contract with global crossing provides for the use of private lines of varying capacity for our backbone 
the amended agreement provides for added capacity for a four year term  and includes a substantial 
table of contents prepayment of fees and charges 
in addition to purchasing services from communications providers  we connect directly to over broadband internet service providers  or isps  generally without either party paying the other 
this industry practice  known as settlement free peering  benefits us by allowing us to place content objects directly on user access networks  which helps us provide higher performance delivery for our customers and eliminate paying transit bandwidth fees to network operators 
this practice also benefits the isp and its customers by allowing them to receive improved content delivery through our local servers and eliminate cost of transit bandwidth associated with delivery receipt of the traffic 
we do not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an earnings process 
accordingly  we do not recognize as revenue the value to the isps associated with the use of our servers nor do we recognize as expense the value of the bandwidth received at discounted or no cost 
these peering relationships are mutually beneficial and are not contractual commitments 
in addition to settlement free peering  we incur costs for non settlement free peering as well as costs associated with connecting to the internet service providers 
during  we continued to reduce our network transit bandwidth delivery costs per gigabyte transferred by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions from our existing suppliers associated with higher purchase commitments 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total transit bandwidth delivery costs increased during we anticipate our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
in addition  during  we entered into relationships for fixed price paid peering ports that will assist in cost management as we continue to increase the volume of traffic moving through our global computing platform 
we expect that our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively constant in compared to for the year ended december   operating expenses increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december  the year ended december  included approximately eight months of operating expenses from our acquisitions of clickability and acceloweb 
this increase was primarily due to increased general and administrative costs primarily increased facility and facilities related costs  and increased payroll and related employee costs  due to increased staffing  and increased fees  licenses and non income taxes  offset by lower litigations expenses and lower bad debt expense  increased sales and marketing expenses primarily increased marketing expenses  increased employee events and increased fees and licenses  offset by a decrease in share based compensation  increased research and development costs primarily payroll and related employee costs due to increased staffing and increased share based compensation and increased non network related depreciation and amortization primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets from our business acquisitions 
we make our capital investment decisions based upon careful evaluation of a number of variables  such as the amount of traffic we anticipate on our network  the cost of the physical infrastructure required to deliver that traffic  and the forecasted capacity utilization of our network 
our capital expenditures have varied over time  in particular  as we purchased servers and other network equipment associated with our network build out 
for example  in  and  we made capital purchases of million  million and million  respectively  which represented  and  respectively  of total revenue for each of those years 
we expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements  as we continue to invest in  refresh and expand our global computing platform 
for  we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately of total revenue for the year 
occasionally we generate revenue from certain customers that are entities related to certain of our executives 
the aggregate amounts of revenue derived from these related party transactions was less than for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  respectively  we did not generate any revenue from related parties 
we are currently engaged in litigation with one of our principal competitors  akamai technologies  inc akamai and its licensor  the massachusetts institute of technology mit  in which these parties have alleged 
table of contents that we are infringing three of their patents 
in february  a jury returned a verdict in this lawsuit  finding that we infringed four claims of the patent at issue united states patent no 
 the patent and rejecting our invalidity defenses 
the court conducted a bench trial in november  regarding our equitable defenses  and we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s earlier denial of our motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol 
our motion for reconsideration of jmol was based largely upon a clarification in the standard for a finding of joint infringement articulated by the federal circuit in the case of muniauction  inc v 
thomson corp 
the muniauction case  released after the court denied our initial motion for jmol 
on april  the court issued its order and memorandum setting aside the adverse jury verdict and ruling that we did not infringe akamai s patent and that we are entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
based upon the court s april  order we reversed the million provision for litigation previously recorded for this lawsuit as we no longer believe that payment of any amounts represented by the litigation provision is probable 
the court entered final judgment in favor of us on may  akamai filed a notice of appeal of the court s decision on may   and the court of appeals for the federal circuit heard arguments by both parties on june  on december  the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued its opinion affirming the district court s entry of judgment in our favor 
on february   akamai filed a motion with the court of appeals for the federal circuit seeking a rehearing and rehearing en banc 
on april   the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued an order denying the petition for rehearing  granting the petition for rehearing en banc  vacating the december  opinion affirming the district court s entry of judgment in our favor  and reinstated the appeal 
on november   the federal circuit heard oral argument regarding the case 
we believe that we presented our case and positions well both in our briefs and in oral argument 
the issues in this case are complex  and it is likely that it will be several months before the federal circuit publishes its opinion in the case 
we believe that we do not infringe akamai s patents and will continue to vigorously defend our position  however  we cannot provide any assurance that the lawsuit ultimately will be resolved in our favor 
an adverse ruling could seriously impact our ability to conduct our business and to offer our products and services to our customers 
a permanent injunction could prevent us from operating our content delivery services or from delivering certain types of traffic  which could impact the viability of our business 
any adverse ruling  in turn  would harm our revenue  market share  reputation  liquidity and overall financial position 
we are not able at this time to estimate the range of potential loss nor  in light of the favorable united states district court order  do we believe that a loss is probable 
therefore  we have made no provision for this lawsuit in our financial statements 
our future results will be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors  in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  as well as increasing the amount of monthly recurring revenue that we derive from our existing customers  manage the prices we charge for our services  as well as the costs associated with operating our network in light of increased competition  successfully manage our litigation with akamai to a favorable conclusion  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  continued ability to deliver a significant portion of our traffic through settlement free peering relationships which significantly reduce our cost of delivery  successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired  and successfully manage the disposition of businesses we have divested from 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states general accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated 
table of contents financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of content delivery and value added services to our customers 
our customers generally execute contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum commitment 
we define usage as customer data sent or received using our content delivery service  or content that is hosted or cached by us at the request or direction of our customer 
we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our services exceed the monthly minimum commit  we recognize revenue for such excess in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
we do not charge installation fees for contract renewals 
installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services and events sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
we have on occasion entered into multi element arrangements 
in october  the fasb issued asu and this asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in asc for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c management s best estimate 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in the third quarter of  we early adopted asu with such adoption being effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  we recognized million of revenue related to a multi element arrangement accounted for in accordance with asu during the year ended december  prior to the adoption of asu effective january   we accounted for multiple element arrangements in accordance with asc when we entered into such arrangements  each element was accounted for separately over its respective service period or at the time of delivery  provided that there was objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
objective evidence of fair value was based on the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element could not be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement was recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided  and other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
if the multi element arrangement included a significant software component  we recognized software license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
if a software license contained an undelivered element  the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
the undelivered elements related to these arrangements are primarily software support and professional services 
vsoe of fair value of software support 
table of contents and professional services is based upon hourly rates or fixed fees charged when those services are sold separately 
if vsoe could not be established for all elements to be delivered  we deferred all amounts received under the arrangement and did not begin to recognize revenue until the delivery of the last element of the contract started 
subsequent to commencement of delivery of the last element  we commenced revenue recognition 
amounts to be received under the contract are then included in the amortizable base and recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the arrangement until we have delivered all elements and have no additional performance obligations 
we had certain multi element arrangements as of december  that were entered into prior to the adoption of asu in under these arrangements  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  in revenue for the years ended december   and as of december   we had deferred revenue related to these multi element arrangements of approximately million that will be recognized over the remaining terms of the respective arrangements based on the underlying elements of the arrangements in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we also sell services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from reseller arrangements is recognized over the term of the contract  based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
reseller revenue was approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an assessment as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense or deferred revenue for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
we record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance 
estimates are used in determining these reserves 
we calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts using the aging of the accounts receivable method 
under this method  the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a calculation that uses our aging of accounts receivable and applies a reserve percentage to the specific age of the receivable to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the reserve percentages are determined based on our historical write off experience 
these estimates could change significantly if our customers financial condition changes or if the economy in general deteriorates 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in the deferral of revenue until payment is made or we determine payment is reasonably assured 
in addition  we record a reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of credits issued in previous periods 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation awards using the fair value method 
the grant date fair value was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model 
the black scholes merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
our expected volatility is derived from our volatility rate as a publicly traded company and historical volatilities of similar public companies within the internet services and network industry 
each company s historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor used by us 
the expected term is calculated using the short cut method provided in the securities exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 which takes into consideration the grant s 
table of contents contractual life and the vesting periods 
the risk free interest factor is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities of approximately equal to each grant s expected term 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based payments expense  as the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own share based awards on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the model 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
we recognize share based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we also estimate when and if performance based awards will be earned 
if an award is not considered probable of being earned  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if the award is deemed probable of being earned  related compensation expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent our estimates of awards considered probable of being earned changes  the amount of stock based compensation recognized will also change 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
contingent consideration contingent consideration is included in other current liabilities  other long term liabilities or as a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheet depending upon characteristics of the obligation 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  additional contingent considerations may be earned in the future by the selling entity upon completion of certain financial milestones 
we record a liability or equity that is recognized on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration based on the estimated probability of achieving the milestones and the probability weighted discount on cash flows 
any change in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
contingent consideration classified as a liability is re measured to fair value each reporting period until the contingency is resolved 
the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
contingent consideration classified as equity is not re measured 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of asc we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 

table of contents in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
we also follow asc to account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
asc states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of such realization 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
our unrecognized tax benefit from uncertain tax positions decreased from january  to december  we anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits will continue to decrease within twelve months of the reporting date  as a result of settling potential tax liabilities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 
our effective tax rate is influenced by the recognition of tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard that such positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority 
in addition  other factors such as changes in tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions  and significant changes in our operations through acquisitions or divestitures can have a material impact on the effective tax rate 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
we conduct business in various foreign countries 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in multiple locations  and the calculation of our foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for united states or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as of december  and  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of october  and we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such dates and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of existing technologies  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
goodwill is carried at its historical cost 
fair value of financial instruments we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as of december   our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  indemnity claim assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses  contingent consideration and income taxes payable 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information on the fair value of our financial instruments 
results of continuing operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands revenue revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase in our value added services revenue of approximately million 
our value added services revenue  which collectively refers to our saas solutions for mobility  web and video content management  web application acceleration  cloud storage  and consulting  includes revenue from the date of acquisition of delve  clickability and acceloweb

use of non gaap financial measures to evaluate our business  we consider and use non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis 
we consider non gaap net income loss to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to illustrate the impact of the effects of share based compensation  litigation expenses  provision for litigation  amortization of intangibles  acquisition related expenses  and discontinued operations 
we define ebitda as gaap net income loss before interest income  interest expense  other income and expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization and discontinued operations 
we believe that ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for operational expenses that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance 
we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period 
in addition  it should be noted that our performance based executive officer bonus structure is tied closely to our performance as measured in part by certain non gaap financial measures 

table of contents in our february  earnings press release  as furnished on form k  we included non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
the terms non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not defined under united states gaap  and are not measures of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with united states gaap 
our non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and when assessing our operating performance  non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs  they do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt that we may incur  they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while share based compensation is a component of operating expense  the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance 
non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows for the periods presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investments are primarily with our commercial and investment banks and  by policy  we limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit 
our outstanding capital lease obligations bear fixed interest rates and fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results or liquidity 
foreign currency risk we operate in north america  emea and asia pacific 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our results of operations as it relates to revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
a portion of our cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies as are revenues associated with certain international customers 
to the extent that the us dollar weakens  similar foreign currency denominated transactions in the future will result in higher revenues and higher cost of revenues and operating expenses  with expenses having the greater impact on our financial results 
similarly  our revenues and expenses will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
we performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of december  to assess the potential impact of fluctuations 
table of contents in exchange rates for all foreign denominated revenues and expenses 
assuming a percent weakening of the us dollar relative to our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses  our net loss for would have been approximately million higher 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements across multiple jurisdictions are similar and would be linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex markets or other changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations 
as of december   our international subsidiaries had the us dollar as their functional currencies 
during the first quarter of  we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries and determined that the operations of our subsidiaries that were previously determined to operate in a us dollar functional currency environment had changed and that their functional currencies should be changed to the local currencies 
effective january   the adjustment from translating these subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency to the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these foreign currency translation adjustments reflect the translation of the balance sheet at period end exchange rates and the income statement at an average exchange rate in effect during each period 
upon the change in functional currency  we recorded a cumulative translation adjustment of approximately million  which is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
because of the change in exchange rates between reporting periods and changes in certain account balances  the foreign currency translation adjustment will change from period to period 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
