item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tracking usbo s benchmark in this annual report on form k 
uscf endeavors to place usbo s trades in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments and otherwise manage usbo s investments so that a will be within plus minus percent of b  where a is the average daily change in usbo s per unit nav for any period of successive valuation days  ie  any nyse arca trading day as of which usbo calculates its per unit nav  and b is the average daily percentage change in the price of the benchmark futures contract over the same period 
uscf believes that market arbitrage opportunities will cause the daily changes in usbo s unit price on the nyse arca to closely track the daily changes in usbo s per unit nav 
uscf believes that the net effect of these two expected relationships and the relationships described above between usbo s per unit nav and the benchmark futures contract  will be that the daily changes in the price of usbo s units on the nyse arca will closely track  in percentage terms  the daily changes in the spot price of a barrel of brent crude oil  less usbo s expenses 
for performance data relating to usbo s ability to track its benchmark  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tracking usbo s benchmark in this annual report on form k 
the specific futures contracts purchased depend on various factors  including a judgment by uscf as to the appropriate diversification of usbo s investments in futures contracts with respect to the month of expiration  and the prevailing price volatility of particular contracts 
while uscf has made significant investments in ice futures contracts  for various reasons  including the ability to enter into the precise amount of exposure to the crude oil market  position limits or other regulatory requirements limiting usbo s holdings  and market conditions  it may invest in futures contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in other crude oil related investments 
to the extent that usbo invests in other crude oil related investments  it would prioritize investments in contracts and instruments that are economically equivalent to the benchmark futures contract  including cleared swaps that satisfy such criteria  and then  to a lesser extent  it would invest in other types of cleared swaps and other contracts  instruments and swaps  including swaps in the over the counter market 
if usbo is required by law or regulation  or by one of its regulators  including a futures exchange  to reduce its position in the benchmark futures contracts to the applicable position limit or to a specified accountability level or if market conditions dictate it would be more appropriate to invest in other crude oil related investments  a substantial portion of usbo s assets could be invested in accordance with such priority in other crude oil related investments that are intended to replicate the return on the benchmark futures contract 
as usbo s assets reach higher levels  it is more likely to exceed position limits  accountability levels or other regulatory limits and  as a result  it is more likely that it will invest in accordance with such priority in other crude oil related investments at such higher levels 
in addition  market conditions that uscf currently anticipates could cause usbo to invest in other crude oil related investments include those allowing usbo to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing 
see item business regulation in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the potential impact of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act on usbo s ability to invest in over the counter transactions and cleared swaps 

table of contents uscf may not be able to fully invest usbo s assets in the futures contract having an aggregate notional amount exactly equal to usbo s nav 
for example  as standardized contracts  the futures contracts are for a specified amount of a particular commodity  and usbo s nav and the proceeds from the sale of a creation basket are unlikely to be an exact multiple of the amounts of those contracts 
as a result  in such circumstances  usbo may be better able to achieve the exact amount of exposure to changes in price of the benchmark futures contract through the use of other crude oil related investments  such as over the counter contracts that have better correlation with changes in price of the benchmark futures contract 
usbo anticipates that to the extent it invests in futures contracts other than contracts on brent crude oil such as futures contracts for heating oil  natural gas  and other petroleum based fuels and other crude oil related investments  it will enter into various non exchange traded derivative contracts to hedge the short term price movements of such futures contracts and other crude oil related investments against the current benchmark futures contract 
uscf does not anticipate letting usbo s futures contracts expire and taking delivery of the underlying commodity 
instead  uscf closes existing positions  eg  when it changes the benchmark futures contract or other crude oil related investments or it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvests the proceeds in new futures contracts or other crude oil related investments 
positions may also be closed out to meet orders for redemption baskets and in such case proceeds for such baskets will not be reinvested 
what is the crude oil market and the petroleum based fuel market usbo may purchase futures contracts traded on the ice futures that are based on brent crude oil 
it may also purchase contracts on other exchanges  including the nymex and the singapore exchange 
the contracts provide for delivery of several grades of domestic and internationally traded foreign crudes  and  among other things  serve the diverse needs of the physical market 
in europe  brent crude oil is the standard for futures contracts and is primarily traded on the ice futures 
brent crude oil is the price reference for two thirds of the world s traded oil 
the ice brent futures is a deliverable contract with an option to cash settle which trades in units of  barrels  us gallons 
the ice futures also offers a west texas intermediate wti crude oil futures contract which also trades in units of  barrels 
the wti crude oil futures contract is cash settled against the prevailing market price for us light  sweet crude oil 
brent crude oil 
crude oil is the world s most actively traded commodity 
the futures contracts for brent crude oil that are traded on the ice futures are the world s second most liquid forum for crude oil trading  as well as the world s second largest volume futures contract trading on a physical commodity 
due to the liquidity and price transparency of light  sweet crude oil futures contracts  they are used as a principal international pricing benchmark 
the futures contracts for brent crude oil trade on the ice futures exchange in units of  us barrels and  if not closed out before maturity  will result in delivery of oil to sullom voe  an oil terminal located in the shetland island near scotland  which is also accessible to the international spot markets by tanker 
the price of crude oil is established by the supply and demand conditions in the global market overall  and more particularly  in the main refining centers of singapore  northwest europe  and the us gulf coast 
demand for petroleum products by consumers  as well as agricultural  manufacturing and transportation industries  determines demand for crude oil by refiners 
since the precursors of product demand are linked to economic activity  crude oil demand will tend to reflect economic conditions 
however  other factors such as weather also influence product and crude oil demand 
the price of brent crude oil has historically exhibited periods of significant volatility 
heating oil 
heating oil  also known as no 
fuel oil  accounts for of the yield of a barrel of crude oil  the second largest cut from oil after gasoline 
the heating oil futures contract listed and traded on the nymex  trades in units of  gallons  barrels and is based on delivery in the new york harbor  the principal cash market center 
the ice futures also offers a heating oil futures contract  which trades in units of  us gallons  barrels 
the price of heating oil has historically been volatile 

table of contents gasoline 
gasoline is the largest single volume refined product sold in the us and accounts for almost half of national oil consumption 
the gasoline futures contract listed and traded on the nymex  trades in units of  gallons  barrels and is based on delivery at petroleum products terminals in the new york harbor  the major east coast trading center for imports and domestic shipments from refineries in the new york harbor area or from the gulf coast refining centers 
the price of gasoline has historically been volatile 
natural gas 
natural gas accounts for almost a quarter of us energy consumption 
the natural gas futures contract listed and traded on the nymex trades in units of  million british thermal units and is based on delivery at the henry hub in louisiana  the nexus of intra and interstate natural gas pipeline systems that draw supplies from the region s prolific gas deposits 
the pipelines serve markets throughout the us east coast  the gulf coast  the midwest  and up to the canadian border 
the price of natural gas has historically been volatile 
what are futures contracts futures contracts are agreements between two parties 
one party agrees to buy a commodity such as brent crude oil from the other party at a later date at a price and quantity agreed upon when the contract is made 
futures contracts are traded on futures exchanges  including the ice futures 
for example  the benchmark futures contract is traded on the ice futures in units of  barrels 
the brent crude futures contracts traded on the ice futures are priced by an electronic  screen based system that determines the price by matching electronically offers to purchase and sell 
additional risks of investing in futures contracts are included in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
impact of accountability levels  position limits and price fluctuation limits 
futures contracts include typical and significant characteristics 
most significantly  the cftc and us designated contract markets such as the nymex have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge  which an investment by usbo is not may hold  own or control 
the net position is the difference between an individual or firm s open long contracts and open short contracts in any one commodity 
in addition  most us based futures exchanges  such as the nymex  limit the daily price fluctuation for futures contracts 
currently  the ice futures imposes position and accountability limits that are similar to those imposed by us based futures exchanges but does not limit the maximum daily price fluctuation  while some other non us futures exchanges have not adopted such limits 
the accountability levels for the benchmark futures contract and other futures contracts traded on us based futures exchanges  such as the nymex  are not a fixed ceiling  but rather a threshold above which the nymex may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor s positions 
the current accountability level for net long or short positions at any one time in the nymex contract for light  sweet crude oil futures contracts is  net future contracts 
if usbo and the related public funds exceed this accountability level for investments in the futures contract for light  sweet crude oil  the nymex will monitor such exposure and ask for further information on their activities  including the total size of all positions  investment and trading strategy  and the extent of liquidity resources of usbo and the related public funds 
if deemed necessary by the nymex  it could also order usbo and the related public funds to reduce their aggregate net position back to the accountability level 
in addition  the ice futures maintains the same position limits and monitoring authority for its light  sweet crude oil contract as the nymex 
there are no specific position accountability levels or limits  nor are there are any maximum daily price fluctuation limits for the ice brent crude oil physically settled futures contract 
as of december   usbo and the related public funds held a net of ice brent crude oil futures co contracts 
position limits differ from accountability levels in that they represent fixed limits on the maximum number of futures contracts that any person may hold and cannot allow such limits to be exceeded without express cftc authority to do so 
in addition to accountability levels and position limits that may apply at any time  the ice futures exchange and the nymex impose position limits on contracts held in the last few days of trading in the near month contract to expire 
it is unlikely that usbo will run up against such position limits because usbo s investment strategy is to close out its positions and roll from the near month contract to expire to the next month contract during a four day period beginning two weeks from expiration of the contract 

table of contents on october   the cftc adopted new rules  which establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures  including futures contracts and options on futures contracts  executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
see commodity interest markets regulation in this annual report on form k for information regarding the dodd frank act 
price volatility 
the price volatility of futures contracts generally has been historically greater than that for traditional securities such as stocks and bonds 
price volatility often is greater day to day as opposed to intra day 
futures contracts tend to be more volatile than stocks and bonds because price movements for crude oil are more currently and directly influenced by economic factors for which current data is available and are traded by crude oil futures traders throughout the day 
because usbo invests a significant portion of its assets in futures contracts  the assets of usbo  and therefore the prices of usbo units  may be subject to greater volatility than traditional securities 
marking to market futures positions 
futures contracts are marked to market at the end of each trading day and the margin required with respect to such contracts is adjusted accordingly 
this process of marking to market is designed to prevent losses from accumulating in any futures account 
therefore  if usbo s futures positions have declined in value  usbo may be required to post variation margin to cover this decline 
alternatively  if usbo s futures positions have increased in value  this increase will be credited to usbo s account 
why does usbo purchase and sell futures contracts usbo s investment objective is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its units per unit nav to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the benchmark futures contract  less usbo s expenses 
usbo invests primarily in futures contracts 
usbo seeks to have its aggregate nav approximate at all times the aggregate market value of the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments it holds 
in connection with investing in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  usbo holds treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that serve as segregated assets supporting usbo s positions in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
for example  the purchase of a futures contract with a notional value of million would not require usbo to pay million upon entering into the contract  rather  only a margin deposit  generally of to of the stated value of the futures contract  would be required 
to secure its futures contract obligations  usbo would deposit the required margin with the futures commission merchant and would separately hold  through its custodian or futures commission merchant  treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents in an amount equal to the balance of the current market value of the contract  which at the contract s inception would be million minus the amount of the margin deposit  or million assuming a margin 
as a result of the foregoing  typically to of usbo s assets are held as margin in segregated accounts with a futures commission merchant 
in addition to the treasuries and cash it posts with the futures commission merchant for the futures contracts it owns  usbo may hold  through the custodian  treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that can be posted as additional margin or as other collateral to support its over the counter contracts 
usbo earns income from the treasuries and or cash equivalents that it purchases  and on the cash it holds through the custodian or futures commission merchant 
usbo anticipates that the earned income will increase the nav and limited partners capital contribution accounts 
usbo reinvests the earned income  holds it in cash  or uses it to pay its expenses 
if usbo reinvests the earned income  it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objective 
what are the trading policies of usbo liquidity usbo invests only in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that  in the opinion of uscf  are traded in sufficient volume to permit the ready taking and liquidation of positions in these financial interests 

table of contents spot commodities while the oil futures contracts traded on the ice futures can be physically settled  usbo does not intend to take or make physical delivery 
usbo may from time to time trade in other crude oil related investments  including contracts based on the spot price of crude oil 
leverage uscf endeavors to have the value of usbo s treasuries  cash and cash equivalents  whether held by usbo or posted as margin or other collateral  at all times approximate the aggregate market value of its obligations under its futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other related investments are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s or other commodity interest s entire market value 
while uscf has not and does not intend to leverage usbo s assets  it is not prohibited from doing so under the lp agreement 
borrowings borrowings are not used by usbo unless usbo is required to borrow money in the event of physical delivery  if usbo trades in cash commodities  or for short term needs created by unexpected redemptions 
over the counter derivatives including spreads and straddles in addition to futures contracts  there are also a number of listed options on the futures contracts on the principal futures exchanges 
these contracts offer investors and hedgers another set of financial vehicles to use in managing exposure to the crude oil market 
consequently  usbo may purchase options on crude oil futures contracts on these exchanges in pursuing its investment objective 
in addition to the futures contracts and options on the futures contracts  there also exists an active non exchange traded market in derivatives tied to crude oil 
these derivatives transactions also known as over the counter contracts are usually entered into between two parties in private contracts 
unlike most of the exchange traded futures contracts or exchange traded options on the futures contracts  each party to such contract bears the credit risk of the other party  ie  the risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract 
to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts  usbo will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association  inc that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty 
uscf assesses or reviews  as appropriate  the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an over the counter contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf s board 
usbo may employ spreads or straddles in its trading to mitigate the differences in its investment portfolio and its goal of tracking the price of the benchmark futures contract 
usbo would use a spread when it chooses to take simultaneous long and short positions in futures written on the same underlying asset  but with different delivery months 
usbo has not employed any hedging methods since all of its investments have been made over an exchange 
therefore  usbo has not been exposed to counterparty risk 
pyramiding usbo has not and will not employ the technique  commonly known as pyramiding  in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions as variation margin for the purchase or sale of additional positions in the same or another commodity interest

table of contents calculating per unit nav usbo s per unit nav is calculated by taking the current market value of its total assets  subtracting any liabilities  and dividing that total by the total number of outstanding units 
the administrator calculates the per unit nav of usbo once each nyse arca trading day 
the per unit nav for a particular trading day is released after pm new york time 
trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at pm new york time 
the administrator uses the ice futures settlement price a weighted average price of trades during a three minute settlement period from pm to pm new york time for the futures contracts traded on the ice futures  but calculates or determines the value of all other usbo investments including futures contracts not traded on the ice futures  other crude oil related investments and treasuries  using market quotations  if available  or other information customarily used to determine the fair value of such investments as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or pm new york time  in accordance with the current administrative agency agreement among bbh co  usbo and uscf 
other information customarily used in determining fair value includes information consisting of market data in the relevant market supplied by one or more third parties including  without limitation  relevant rates  prices  yields  yield curves  volatilities  spreads  correlations or other market data in the relevant market  or information of the types described above from internal sources if that information is of the same type used by usbo in the regular course of its business for the valuation of similar transactions 
the information may include costs of funding  to the extent costs of funding are not and would not be a component of the other information being utilized 
third parties supplying quotations or market data may include  without limitation  dealers in the relevant markets  end users of the relevant product  information vendors  brokers and other sources of market information 
in addition  in order to provide updated information relating to usbo for use by investors and market professionals  the nyse arca calculates and disseminates throughout the core trading session on each trading day an updated indicative fund value 
the indicative fund value is calculated by using the prior day s closing per unit nav of usbo as a base and updating that value throughout the trading day to reflect changes in the most recently reported trade price for the active brent crude oil futures contracts on the ice futures 
the prices reported for those futures contract months are adjusted based on the prior day s spread differential between settlement values for the relevant contract and the spot month contract 
in the event that the spot month contract is also the benchmark futures contract  the last sale price for that contract is not adjusted 
the indicative fund value unit basis disseminated during nyse arca core trading session hours should not be viewed as an actual real time update of the per unit nav  because the per unit nav is calculated only once at the end of each trading day based upon the relevant end of day values of usbo s investments 
the nyse arca disseminates the indicative fund value through the facilities of cta cq high speed lines 
in addition  the indicative fund value is published on the nyse arca s website and is available through on line information services such as bloomberg and reuters 
dissemination of the indicative fund value provides additional information that is not otherwise available to the public and is useful to investors and market professionals in connection with the trading of usbo units on the nyse arca 
investors and market professionals are able throughout the trading day to compare the market price of usbo and the indicative fund value 
if the market price of usbo units diverges significantly from the indicative fund value  market professionals will have an incentive to execute arbitrage trades 
for example  if usbo appears to be trading at a discount compared to the indicative fund value  a market professional could buy usbo units on the nyse arca and sell short futures contracts 
such arbitrage trades can tighten the tracking between the market price of usbo and the indicative fund value and thus can be beneficial to all market participants 
in addition  other futures contracts  other crude oil related investments and treasuries held by usbo are valued by the administrator  using rates and points received from client approved third party vendors such as reuters and wm company and advisor quotes 
these investments are not included in the indicative value 
the indicative fund value is based on the prior day s per unit nav and moves up and down solely according to changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 

table of contents creation and redemption of units usbo creates and redeems units from time to time  but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets 
the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usbo or the distribution by usbo of the amount of treasuries and any cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed  the amount of which is based on the combined nav of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined after pm new york time on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received 
authorized purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets 
authorized purchasers must be registered broker dealers or other securities market participants  such as banks and other financial institutions  that are not required to register as broker dealers to engage in securities transactions as described below  and dtc participants 
to become an authorized purchaser  a person must enter into an authorized purchaser agreement with uscf on behalf of usbo 
the authorized purchaser agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets and for the delivery of the treasuries and any cash required for such creations and redemptions 
the authorized purchaser agreement and the related procedures attached thereto may be amended by uscf  without the consent of any limited partner or unitholder or authorized purchaser 
from july  through december  and continuing at least through may   the applicable transaction fee paid by authorized purchasers is to usbo for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets  prior to july   this fee was  authorized purchasers who make deposits with usbo in exchange for baskets receive no fees  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usbo or uscf  and no such person will have any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usbo to effect any sale or resale of units 
as of december   authorized purchasers had entered into agreements with uscf on behalf of usbo 
during the year ended december   usbo issued creation baskets and redeemed redemption baskets 
certain authorized purchasers are expected to be capable of participating directly in the physical crude oil market and the crude oil futures market 
in some cases  authorized purchasers or their affiliates may from time to time buy crude oil or sell crude oil or crude oil interests and may profit in these instances 
uscf believes that the size and operation of the crude oil market make it unlikely that an authorized purchaser s direct activities in the crude oil or securities markets will significantly affect the price of crude oil  crude oil interests  or the price of the units 
each authorized purchaser is required to be registered as a broker dealer under the exchange act and is a member in good standing with finra  or exempt from being or otherwise not required to be registered as a broker dealer or a member of finra  and qualified to act as a broker or dealer in the states or other jurisdictions where the nature of its business so requires 
certain authorized purchasers may also be regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations 
each authorized purchaser has its own set of rules and procedures  internal controls and information barriers as it determines is appropriate in light of its own regulatory regime 
under the authorized purchaser agreement  uscf has agreed to indemnify the authorized purchasers against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and to contribute to the payments the authorized purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities 
the following description of the procedures for the creation and redemption of baskets is only a summary and an investor should refer to the relevant provisions of the lp agreement and the form of authorized purchaser agreement for more detail  each of which is incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
creation procedures on any business day  an authorized purchaser may place an order with the marketing agent to create one or more baskets 
for purposes of processing purchase and redemption orders  a business day means any day other than a day when any of the nyse arca  the ice futures or the nyse is closed for regular trading 
purchase orders must be placed by pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse arca  whichever is earlier 
the day on which the marketing agent receives a valid purchase order is referred to as the purchase order date 

table of contents by placing a purchase order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deposit treasuries  cash  or a combination of treasuries and cash  as described below 
prior to the delivery of baskets for a purchase order  the authorized purchaser must also have wired to the custodian the non refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order 
authorized purchasers may not withdraw a creation request 
the manner by which creations are made is dictated by the terms of the authorized purchaser agreement 
by placing a purchase order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deposit treasuries  cash  or a combination of treasuries and cash with the custodian  and if required by uscf in its sole discretion  enter into or arrange for a block trade  an exchange for physical or exchange for swap  or any other over the counter energy transaction through itself or a designated acceptable broker with usbo for the purchase of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the purchase order date 
if an authorized purchaser fails to consummate and  the order shall be cancelled 
the number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by uscf  in its sole discretion  to meet usbo s investment objective and shall be purchased as a result of the authorized purchaser s purchase of units 
determination of required deposits the total deposit required to create each basket creation basket deposit is the amount of treasuries and or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usbo net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees  expenses and other liabilities on the purchase order date as the number of units to be created under the purchase order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the purchase order dates 
uscf determines  directly in its sole discretion or in consultation with the administrator  the requirements for treasuries and the amount of cash  including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury and proportions of treasury and cash that may be included in deposits to create baskets 
the marketing agent will publish such requirements at the beginning of each business day 
the amount of cash deposit required is the difference between the aggregate market value of the treasuries required to be included in a creation basket deposit as of pm new york time on the date the order to purchase is properly received and the total required deposit 
delivery of required deposits an authorized purchaser who places a purchase order is responsible for transferring to usbo s account with the custodian the required amount of treasuries and cash by the end of the third business day following the purchase order date 
upon receipt of the deposit amount  the administrator directs dtc to credit the number of baskets ordered to the authorized purchaser s dtc account on the third business day following the purchase order date 
the expense and risk of delivery and ownership of treasuries until such treasuries have been received by the custodian on behalf of usbo shall be borne solely by the authorized purchaser 
because orders to purchase baskets must be placed by pm  new york time  but the total payment required to create a basket during the continuous offering period will not be determined until after pm new york time on the date the purchase order is received  authorized purchasers will not know the total amount of the payment required to create a basket at the time they submit an irrevocable purchase order for the basket 
usbo s per unit nav and the total amount of the payment required to create a basket could rise or fall substantially between the time an irrevocable purchase order is submitted and the time the amount of the purchase price in respect thereof is determined 
rejection of purchase orders uscf acting by itself or through the marketing agent shall have the absolute right but no obligation to reject a purchase order or a creation basket deposit if it determines that the investment alternative available to usbo at that time will not enable it to meet its investment objective  it determines that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit is not in proper form  it believes that the purchase order or the creation basket deposit would have adverse tax consequences to usbo  the limited partners or its unitholders  the acceptance or receipt of the creation basket deposit would  in the opinion of counsel to uscf  be unlawful  or circumstances outside the control of uscf  marketing agent or custodian make it  for all practical purposes  not feasible to process creations of baskets 

table of contents none of uscf  the marketing agent or the custodian will be liable for the rejection of any purchase order or creation basket deposit 
redemption procedures the procedures by which an authorized purchaser can redeem one or more baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of baskets 
on any business day  an authorized purchaser may place an order with the marketing agent to redeem one or more baskets 
redemption orders must be placed by pm new york time or the close of regular trading on the nyse arca  whichever is earlier 
a redemption order so received will be effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the marketing agent 
the redemption procedures allow authorized purchasers to redeem baskets and do not entitle an individual unitholder to redeem any units in an amount less than a redemption basket  or to redeem baskets other than through an authorized purchaser 
by placing a redemption order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deliver the baskets to be redeemed through dtc s book entry system to usbo  as described below 
prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order  the authorized purchaser must also have wired to usbo s account at the custodian the non refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order 
an authorized purchaser may not withdraw a redemption order 
the manner by which redemptions are made is dictated by the terms of the authorized purchaser agreement 
by placing a redemption order  an authorized purchaser agrees to deliver the redemption basket to be redeemed through dtc s book entry system to usbo s account with the custodian not later than pm new york time on the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order redemption distribution date  and if required by uscf in its sole discretion  enter into or arrange for a block trade  an exchange for physical or exchange for swap  or any other over the counter energy transaction through itself or a designated acceptable broker with usbo for the sale of a number and type of futures contracts at the closing settlement price for such contracts on the redemption order date 
if an authorized purchaser fails to consummate and above  the order shall be cancelled 
the number and type of contracts specified shall be determined by uscf  in its sole discretion  to meet usbo s investment objective and shall be sold as a result of the authorized purchaser s sale of units 
determination of redemption distribution the redemption distribution from usbo consists of a transfer to the redeeming authorized purchaser of an amount of treasuries and or cash that is in the same proportion to the total assets of usbo net of estimated accrued but unpaid fees  expenses and other liabilities on the date the order to redeem is properly received as the number of units to be redeemed under the redemption order is in proportion to the total number of units outstanding on the date the order is received 
uscf  directly or in consultation with the administrator  determines the requirements for treasuries and the amounts of cash  including the maximum permitted remaining maturity of a treasury  and the proportions of treasuries and cash that may be included in distributions to redeem baskets 
the marketing agent will publish an estimate of the redemption distribution per basket as of the beginning of each business day 

table of contents delivery of redemption distribution the redemption distribution due from usbo will be delivered to the authorized purchaser by pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if  by pm new york time on such third business day  usbo s dtc account has been credited with the baskets to be redeemed 
if usbo s dtc account has not been credited with all of the baskets to be redeemed by such time  the redemption distribution will be delivered to the extent of whole baskets received 
any remainder of the redemption distribution will be delivered on the next business day to the extent of remaining whole baskets received if usbo receives the fee applicable to the extension of the redemption distribution date which uscf may  from time to time  determine and the remaining baskets to be redeemed are credited to usbo s dtc account by pm new york time on such next business day 
any further outstanding amount of the redemption order shall be cancelled 
pursuant to information from uscf  the custodian will also be authorized to deliver the redemption distribution notwithstanding that the baskets to be redeemed are not credited to usbo s dtc account by pm new york time on the third business day following the redemption order date if the authorized purchaser has collateralized its obligation to deliver the baskets through dtc s book entry system on such terms as uscf may from time to time determine 
suspension or rejection of redemption orders uscf may  in its discretion  suspend the right of redemption  or postpone the redemption settlement date  for any period during which the nyse arca or the ice futures is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closings  or trading on the nyse arca or the ice futures is suspended or restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery  disposal or evaluation of treasuries is not reasonably practicable  or for such other period as uscf determines to be necessary for the protection of the limited partners or unitholders 
for example  uscf may determine that it is necessary to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of usbo s assets at an appropriate value to fund a redemption 
if uscf has difficulty liquidating its positions  eg  because of a market disruption event in the futures markets  a suspension of trading by the exchange where the futures contracts are listed or an unanticipated delay in the liquidation of a position in an over the counter contract  it may be appropriate to suspend redemptions until such time as such circumstances are rectified 
none of uscf  the marketing agent  the administrator  or the custodian will be liable to any person or in any way for any loss or damages that may result from any such suspension or postponement 
redemption orders must be made in whole baskets 
uscf will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the authorized purchaser agreement or if the fulfillment of the order  in the opinion of its counsel  might be unlawful 
uscf may also reject a redemption order if the number of units being redeemed would reduce the remaining outstanding units to  units ie  two baskets or less 
creation and redemption transaction fee to compensate usbo for its expenses in connection with the creation and redemption of baskets  an authorized purchaser is required to pay a transaction fee per order to create or redeem baskets  regardless of the number of baskets in such order 
from july  through december  and continuing at least through may   the applicable transaction fee paid by authorized purchasers was to usbo for each order they place to create or redeem one or more baskets  prior to july   this fee was  the transaction fee may be reduced  increased or otherwise changed by uscf 
uscf shall notify dtc of any change in the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of baskets until days after the date of the notice 
tax responsibility authorized purchasers are responsible for any transfer tax  sales or use tax  stamp tax  recording tax  value added tax or similar tax or governmental charge applicable to the creation or redemption of baskets  regardless of whether or not such tax or charge is imposed directly on the authorized purchaser  and agree to indemnify uscf and usbo if they are required by law to pay any such tax  together with any applicable penalties  additions to tax and interest thereon 

table of contents secondary market transactions as noted  usbo creates and redeems units from time to time  but only in one or more creation baskets or redemption baskets 
the creation and redemption of baskets are only made in exchange for delivery to usbo or the distribution by usbo of the amount of treasuries and cash represented by the baskets being created or redeemed  the amount of which will be based on the aggregate nav of the number of units included in the baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem baskets is properly received 
as discussed above  authorized purchasers are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets 
authorized purchasers must be registered broker dealers or other securities market participants  such as banks and other financial institutions that are not required to register as broker dealers to engage in securities transactions 
an authorized purchaser is under no obligation to create or redeem baskets  and an authorized purchaser is under no obligation to offer to the public units of any baskets it does create 
authorized purchasers that do offer to the public units from the baskets they create will do so at per unit offering prices that are expected to reflect  among other factors  the trading price of the units on the nyse arca  the per unit nav of usbo at the time the authorized purchaser purchased the creation baskets and the per unit nav of the units at the time of the offer of the units to the public  the supply of and demand for units at the time of sale  and the liquidity of the futures contract market and the market for other crude oil related investments 
the prices of units offered by authorized purchasers are expected to fall between usbo s per unit nav and the trading price of the units on the nyse arca at the time of sale 
units initially comprising the same basket but offered by authorized purchasers to the public at different times may have different offering prices 
an order for one or more baskets may be placed by an authorized purchaser on behalf of multiple clients 
authorized purchasers who make deposits with usbo in exchange for baskets receive no fees  commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either usbo or uscf  and no such person has any obligation or responsibility to uscf or usbo to effect any sale or resale of units 
units trade in the secondary market on the nyse arca 
units may trade in the secondary market at prices that are lower or higher relative to their per unit nav 
the amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the per unit nav may be influenced by various factors  including the number of investors who seek to purchase or sell units in the secondary market and the liquidity of the futures contracts market and the market for other crude oil related investments 
while the units trade during the core trading session on the nyse arca until pm new york time and trading in futures contracts on the ice futures exchange continues throughout the entire nyse arca trading day  liquidity in the market for futures contracts and other crude oil related investments traded on the nymex may be reduced after the close of the nymex at pm new york time 
as a result  during this time  particularly if usbo has invested in futures contracts and other crude oil related investment traded on the nymex  trading spreads  and the resulting premium or discount  on the units may widen 
investments uscf causes usbo to transfer the proceeds from the sale of creation baskets to the custodian or other custodian for trading activities 
uscf will invest usbo s assets in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments and investments in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents 
when usbo purchases a futures contract and certain exchange traded other crude oil related investments  usbo is required to deposit to with the selling futures commission merchant on behalf of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as security to ensure payment for the obligation under crude oil interests at maturity 
this deposit is known as initial margin 
counterparties in transactions in over the counter crude oil interests will generally impose similar collateral requirements on usbo 
uscf will invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents subject to these margin and collateral requirements 
uscf has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are uscf has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that are held on deposit with the futures commission merchant or other custodian  used for other investments  and held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves 

table of contents ongoing margin and collateral payments will generally be required for both exchange traded and over the counter crude oil interests based on changes in the value of the crude oil interests 
furthermore  ongoing collateral requirements with respect to over the counter crude oil interests are negotiated by the parties  and may be affected by overall market volatility  volatility of the underlying commodity or index  the ability of the counterparty to hedge its exposure under a crude oil interest  and each party s creditworthiness 
in light of the differing requirements for initial payments under exchange traded and over the counter crude oil interests and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments  it is not possible to estimate what portion of usbo s assets will be posted as margin or collateral at any given time 
the treasuries  cash and cash equivalents held by usbo will constitute reserves that will be available to meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements 
all interest income will be used for usbo s benefit 
a futures commission merchant  counterparty  government agency or commodity exchange could increase margin or collateral requirements applicable to usbo to hold trading positions at any time 
moreover  margin is merely a security deposit and has no bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held 
the assets of usbo posted as margin for futures contracts are held in segregated accounts pursuant to the commodity exchange act and cftc regulations 
the commodity interest markets general the cea governs the regulation of commodity interest transactions  markets and intermediaries 
the cea provides for varying degrees of regulation of commodity interest transactions depending upon the type of instrument being traded eg  contracts for future delivery  options  swaps or spot contracts  the type of commodity underlying the instrument distinctions are made between instruments based on agricultural commodities  energy and metals commodities and financial commodities  the nature of the parties to the transaction retail  eligible contract participant  or eligible commercial entity  whether the transaction is entered into on a principal to principal or intermediated basis  the type of market on which the transaction occurs  and whether the transaction is subject to clearing through a clearing organization 
the offer and sale of units of usbo  as well as units of each of the related public funds  is registered under the securities act 
usbo and the related public funds are subject to the requirements of the securities act  the exchange act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder as administered by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
firms participation in the distribution of units are regulated as described above  as well as by the self regulatory association  finra 
futures contracts a futures contract is a standardized contract traded on  or subject to the rules of  an exchange that calls for the future delivery of a specified quantity and type of a commodity at a specified time and place 
futures contracts are traded on a wide variety of commodities  including agricultural products  bonds  stock indices  interest rates  currencies  energy and metals 
the size and terms of futures contracts on a particular commodity are identical and are not subject to any negotiation  other than with respect to price and the number of contracts traded between the buyer and seller 
the contractual obligations of a buyer or seller may generally be satisfied by taking or making physical delivery of the underlying commodity or by making an offsetting sale or purchase of an identical futures contract on the same or linked exchange before the designated date of delivery 
the difference between the price at which the futures contract is purchased or sold and the price paid for the offsetting sale or purchase  after allowance for brokerage commissions  constitutes the profit or loss to the trader 
some futures contracts  such as stock index contracts  settle in cash reflecting the difference between the contract purchase sale price and the contract settlement price rather than by delivery of the underlying commodity 
in market terminology  a trader who purchases a futures contract is long in the market and a trader who sells a futures contract is short in the market 
before a trader closes out his long or short position by an offsetting sale or purchase  his outstanding contracts are known as open trades or open positions 
the aggregate amount of open positions held by traders in a particular contract is referred to as the open interest in such contract 

table of contents forward contracts a forward contract is a contractual obligation to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and  therefore  is economically similar to a futures contract 
unlike futures contracts  however  forward contracts are typically traded in the over the counter markets and are not standardized contracts 
forward contracts for a given commodity are generally available for various amounts and maturities and are subject to individual negotiation between the parties involved 
moreover  generally there is no direct means of offsetting or closing out a forward contract by taking an offsetting position as one would a futures contract on a us exchange 
if a trader desires to close out a forward contract position  he generally will establish an opposite position in the contract but will settle and recognize the profit or loss on both positions simultaneously on the delivery date 
thus  unlike in the futures contract market where a trader who has offset positions will recognize profit or loss immediately  in the forward market a trader with a position that has been offset at a profit will generally not receive such profit until the delivery date  and likewise a trader with a position that has been offset at a loss will generally not have to pay money until the delivery date 
in recent years  however  the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized  and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making or taking delivery of the underlying commodity 
to date  the forward markets have been largely unregulated  forward contracts have been executed bilaterally and  in general  forward contracts have not been cleared or guaranteed by a third party 
while recently adopted laws and regulations may require certain forward contracts to be cleared through regulated clearing organizations  absent such clearing organizations  usbo s trading in forward contracts will be exposed to the creditworthiness of the counterparties on the other side of the trade 
options on futures contracts options on futures contracts are standardized contracts traded on an exchange 
an option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option the right  but not the obligation  to take a position at a specified price the striking  strike  or exercise price in the underlying futures contract or underlying interest 
the buyer of a call option acquires the right  but not the obligation  to purchase or take a long position in the underlying interest  and the buyer of a put option acquires the right  but not the obligation  to sell or take a short position in the underlying interest 
the seller  or writer  of an option is obligated to take a position in the underlying interest at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised 
the seller of a call option must stand ready to take a short position in the underlying interest at the strike price if the buyer should exercise the option 
the seller of a put option  on the other hand  must stand ready to take a long position in the underlying interest at the strike price 
a call option is said to be in the money if the strike price is below current market levels and out of the money if the strike price is above current market levels 
conversely  a put option is said to be in the money if the strike price is above the current market levels and out of the money if the strike price is below current market levels 
options have limited life spans  usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying interest 
some options  however  expire significantly in advance of such date 
the purchase price of an option is referred to as its premium  which consists of its intrinsic value which is related to the underlying market value plus its time value 
as an option nears its expiration date  the time value shrinks and the market and intrinsic values move into parity 
an option that is out of the money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless 
on certain exchanges  in the money options are automatically exercised on their expiration date  but on others unexercised options simply become worthless after their expiration date 
regardless of how much the market swings  the most an option buyer can lose is the option premium 
the option buyer deposits his premium with his broker  and the money goes to the option seller 
option sellers  on the other hand  face risks similar to participants in the futures markets 
for example  since the seller of a call option is assigned a short futures position if the option is exercised  his risk is the same as someone who initially sold a futures contract 
because no one can predict exactly how the market will move  the option seller posts margin to demonstrate his ability to meet any potential contractual obligations 

table of contents options on forward contracts or commodities options on forward contracts or commodities operate in a manner similar to options on futures contracts 
an option on a forward contract or commodity gives the buyer of the option the right  but not the obligation  to take a position at a specified price in the underlying forward contract or commodity 
however  unlike options on futures contracts  options on forward contracts or on commodities are individually negotiated contracts between counterparties and are typically traded in the over the counter market 
therefore  options on forward contracts and physical commodities possess many of the same characteristics of forward contracts with respect to offsetting positions and credit risk that are described above 
swap contracts swap transactions generally involve contracts between two parties to exchange a stream of payments computed by reference to a notional amount and the price of the asset that is the subject of the swap 
swap contracts are principally traded off exchange  although certain swap contracts are also being traded in electronic trading facilities and cleared through clearing organizations 
swaps are usually entered into on a net basis  that is  the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement  with the parties receiving or paying  as the case may be  only the net amount of the two payments 
swaps do not generally involve the delivery of underlying assets or principal 
accordingly  the risk of loss with respect to swaps is generally limited to the net amount of payments that the party is contractually obligated to make 
in some swap transactions one or both parties may require collateral deposits from the counterparty to support that counterparty s obligation under the swap agreement 
if the counterparty to such a swap defaults  the risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the party is contractually entitled to receive less any collateral deposits it is holding 
some swap transactions are cleared through central counterparties 
these transactions  known as cleared swaps  involve two counterparties first agreeing to the terms of a swap transaction  then submitting the transaction to a clearing house that acts as the central counterparty 
once accepted by the clearing house  the original swap transaction is novated and the central counterparty becomes the counterparty to a trade with each of the original parties based upon the trade terms determined in the original transaction 
in this manner each individual swap counterparty reduces its risk of loss due to counterparty nonperformance because the clearing house acts as the counterparty to each transaction 
regulation futures exchanges in the united states are subject to varying degrees of regulation under the cea depending on whether such exchange is a designated contract market  exempt board of trade or electronic trading facility 
clearing organizations are also subject to the cea and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder and administered by the cftc 
the cftc is the governmental agency charged with responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and commodity interest trading conducted on those exchanges 
the cftc s function is to implement the cea s objectives of preventing price manipulation and excessive speculation and promoting orderly and efficient commodity interest markets 
in addition  the various exchanges and clearing organizations themselves exercise regulatory and supervisory authority over their member firms 
the cftc also regulates the activities of commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators and the cftc has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons activities 
pursuant to its authority  the cftc requires a cpo  such as uscf  to keep accurate  current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates 
the cftc may suspend  modify or terminate the registration of any registrant for failure to comply with cftc rules or regulations 
suspension  restriction or termination of uscf s registration as a cpo would prevent it  until such time if any as such registration were to be reinstated  from managing  and might result in the termination of  usbo or the related public funds 

table of contents the cea also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc 
under certain circumstances  the cea grants unitholders the right to institute a reparations proceeding before the cftc against uscf as a registered commodity pool operator  as well as those of their respective employees who are required to be registered under the cea 
unitholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the cea 
pursuant to authority in the cea  the nfa has been formed and registered with the cftc as a registered futures association 
the nfa is the only self regulatory association for commodities professionals other than the exchanges 
as such  the nfa promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals that do not comply with such standards 
the cftc has delegated to the nfa responsibility for the registration of commodity pool operation 
uscf is a member of the nfa 
as a member of the nfa  uscf is subject to nfa standards relating to fair trade practices  financial condition  and consumer protection 
the cftc is prohibited by statute from regulating trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets 
the cea requires all futures commission merchants  such as usbo s clearing brokers  to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements  to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers funds and positions  and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the cftc 
the cftc has similar authority over introducing brokers  or persons who solicit or accept orders for commodity interest trades but who do not accept margin deposits for the execution of trades 
the cea authorizes the cftc to regulate trading by futures commission merchants and by their officers and directors  permits the cftc to require action by exchanges in the event of market emergencies  and establishes an administrative procedure under which customers may institute complaints for damages arising from alleged violations of the cea 
the cea also gives the states powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the cftc 
the regulations of the cftc and the nfa prohibit any representation by a person registered with the cftc or by any member of the nfa  that registration with the cftc  or membership in the nfa  in any respect indicates that the cftc or the nfa  as the case may be  has approved or endorsed that person or that person s trading program or objectives 
the registrations and memberships of the parties described in this summary must not be considered as constituting any such approval or endorsement 
likewise  no futures exchange has given or will give any similar approval or endorsement 
the regulation of commodity interest trading in the united states and other countries is an evolving area of the law 
the various statements made in this summary are subject to modification by legislative action and changes in the rules and regulations of the cftc  the nfa  the futures exchanges  clearing organizations and other regulatory bodies 
on july   a broad financial regulatory reform bill  the dodd frank act  was signed into law 
all of the dodd frank act s provisions became effective on july   but the actual implementation of some of the provisions is subject to continuing uncertainty because implementing rules and regulations have not been completely finalized and have been challenged in court 
pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements  some specific examples of how the new dodd frank act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact usbo are discussed below 
futures contracts and position limits provisions in the dodd frank act include the requirement that position limits be established on a wide range of commodity interests including energy based and other commodity futures contracts  certain cleared commodity swaps and certain over the counter commodity contracts  new registration  recordkeeping  capital and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations  and the forced use of clearinghouse mechanisms for most swap transactions that are currently entered into in the over the counter market 
the new law and the rules thereunder may negatively impact usbo s ability to meet its investment objective either through limits or requirements imposed on it or upon its counterparties 
further  increased regulation of  and the imposition of additional costs on  swap transactions under the new legislation and implementing regulations could cause a reduction in the swap market and the overall derivatives markets  which could restrict liquidity and adversely affect usbo 
in particular  new position limits imposed on usbo or its counterparties may impact usbo s ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective  and new requirements  including capital and mandatory clearing  may increase the cost of usbo s investments and doing business  which could adversely impact the ability of usbo to achieve its investment objective 

table of contents on october   the cftc adopted regulations implementing position limits and limit formulas for core physical commodity futures contracts  including the futures contracts and options on futures contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts collectively  referenced contracts 
the new regulations require  among other things  aggregation of position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
however  the regulations do not appear to require aggregation of referenced contracts held by separate related public funds 
although the regulations are effective on january   the position limit rules will be implemented in two phases spot month position limits and non spot month position limits 
spot month limits will be effective sixty days after the term swap is defined under the dodd frank act see below 
the limits adopted will be based on the spot month position limit levels currently in place at applicable futures exchanges or designated contract market or dcm 
thereafter  the spot month limits will be adjusted annually for energy contracts 
these subsequent limits will be based on the cftc s determination of deliverable supply in consultation with the futures exchanges 
spot month position limit levels will be set generally at of estimated deliverable supply  and limits will be applied separately for physical delivery and cash settled contracts in the same commodity 
non spot month position limits will go into effect by cftc order after the cftc has received one year of open interest data on physical commodity cleared and uncleared swaps under the swaps large trader reporting rule 
the non spot month limits will be adjusted biennially based on referenced contract open interest 
non spot month position limits ie  limits applied to positions in all contract months combined or in a single contract month will be set using the percent formula percent of the contract s first  of open interest and percent thereafter 
these limits will be reset biennially based on two years of open interest data 
on december   the securities industry and financial markets association sifma and the international swaps and derivatives association isda filed a lawsuit challenging the cftc s position limits rule 
the lawsuit asserts that the position limits rule inadequately fulfills the required cost benefit analysis 
it is not known at this time what effect this lawsuit will have on the implementation of the new position limits rule 
based on its current understanding of the final position limit regulations  uscf does not anticipate significant negative impact on the ability of usbo to achieve its investment objective 
however  as of the filing of this annual report on form k  additional studies are required to be conducted before all requirements of the final rules are implemented  and therefore  it cannot be determined with certainty what impact such regulations will have on usbo 
swap transactions the dodd frank act imposes new regulatory requirements on certain swap transactions that usbo is authorized to engage in that may ultimately impact the ability of usbo to meet its investment objective 
on april   the cftc and the sec proposed joint rules defining the term swap and thus providing more clarity regarding which transactions will be regulated as such under the dodd frank act 
however  the cftc and sec have not implemented final regulations on this issue and it is therefore still uncertain which types of transactions will be ultimately regulated as swaps 
the proposed rule defining swap and security based swap has not been finalized as of the filing of this annual report on form k 
the dodd frank act requires that certain transactions ultimately falling within the definition of swap be executed on organized exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through regulated clearing organizations which are referred to in the dodd frank act as derivative clearing organizations 
however  as described above  it is currently unknown which swaps will be subject to such trading and clearing requirements 
if a swap is required to be cleared  the initial margin will be set by the clearing organization  subject to certain regulatory requirements and guidelines 
initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into uncleared swaps and capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants who enter into both cleared and uncleared trades will be set by the cftc  the sec or the applicable prudential regulator 
on july   the cftc adopted final regulations to determine which entities will be regulated as swap dealers and major swap participants and thus have to comply with these capital and margin requirements as well as a multitude of other requirements under the dodd frank act 
in general  increased regulation of  and the imposition of additional costs on  swap transactions could have an adverse effect on usbo by  for example  reducing the size of and therefore liquidity in the derivatives market  increasing transaction costs and decreasing the ability to customize derivative transactions 
the final rule regarding review of swaps for mandatory clearing went effective september  
table of contents on july   the cftc issued an order providing temporary relief from certain swaps related provisions of title vii that would have automatically taken effect on july  the final order granted temporary exemptive relief that  by its terms  expires upon the earlier of the effective date of the required final rulemaking or december  on october   the cftc issued an order  which modifies the july  order by extending the temporary exemptive relief to the earlier of the effective date of the required final rulemaking or july  on january   the cftc adopted a rule requiring futures commission merchants and derivative clearing organizations to segregate customer collateral supporting cleared swaps 
this rule is scheduled to become effective on november  usbo does not anticipate any impact to its operations in order to meet the requirements of the new rule 
commodity margin original or initial margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts 
maintenance margin is the amount generally less than the original margin to which a trader s account may decline before he must deliver additional margin 
a margin deposit is like a cash performance bond 
it helps assure the trader s performance of the futures contracts that he or she purchases or sells 
futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage ranging upward from of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract 
because of such low margin requirements  price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that  in relation to the amount invested  are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation 
as discussed below  adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin 
in addition  the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract 
brokerage firms  such as usbo s clearing brokers  carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts may not accept lower  and generally require higher  amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves 
the clearing brokers require usbo to make margin deposits equal to exchange minimum levels for all commodity interest contracts 
this requirement may be altered from time to time in the clearing brokers discretion 
trading in the over the counter markets where no clearing facility is provided generally does not require margin but generally does require the extension of credit between counterparties 
this extension of credit is generally secured by transfers of collateral and or independent amounts 
collateral is transferred between counterparties during the term of an over the counter transaction based upon the changing value of the transaction  while independent amounts are fixed amounts posted by one or both counterparties at the start of an over the counter transaction 
when a trader purchases an option  there is no margin requirement  however  the option premium must be paid in full 
when a trader sells an option  on the other hand  he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and  in addition  an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option 
the margin requirements imposed on the selling of options  although adjusted to reflect the probability that out of the money options will not be exercised  can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly 
complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions  which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest 
margin requirements are computed each day by a trader s clearing broker 
when the market value of a particular open commodity interest position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements  a margin call is made by the broker 
if the margin call is not met within a reasonable time  the broker may close out the trader s position 
with respect to usbo s trading  usbo and not its investors personally is subject to margin calls 

table of contents finally  many major us exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would  in the case of some accounts  be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis  measuring the total risk of the combined positions

risk factors 
the risk factors should be read in connection with the other information included in this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and usbo s financial statements and the related notes 
risks associated with investing directly or indirectly in crude oil investing in crude oil interests subjects usbo to the risks of the crude oil industry and this could result in large fluctuations in the price of usbo s units 
usbo is subject to the risks and hazards of the crude oil industry because it invests in crude oil interests 
the risks and hazards that are inherent in the crude oil industry may cause the price of crude oil to widely fluctuate 
if the changes in percentage terms of usbo s units accurately track the changes in percentage terms of the benchmark futures contract or the spot price of brent crude oil  then the price of its units may also fluctuate 
the exploration and production of crude oil are uncertain processes with many risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for crude oil is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations or production of crude oil  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  
table of contents equipment failures or repairs  fires or other accidents  adverse weather conditions  pipeline ruptures  spills or other supply disruptions  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
crude oil transmission  distribution  gathering  and processing activities involve numerous risks that may affect the price of crude oil 
there are a variety of hazards inherent in crude oil transmission  distribution  gathering  and processing  such as leaks  explosions  pollution  release of toxic substances  adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and flooding  pipeline failure  abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of crude oil  scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  physical damage to the gathering or transportation system  and other hazards which could affect the price of crude oil 
to the extent these hazards limit the supply or delivery of crude oil  crude oil prices will increase 
changes in the political climate could have negative consequences for crude oil prices 
tensions with iran  the world s fourth largest oil exporter  could put oil exports in jeopardy 
other global concerns include civil unrest and sabotage affecting the flow of oil from nigeria  a large oil exporter 
meanwhile  friction continues between the governments of the united states and venezuela  a major exporter of oil to the united states 
additionally  a series of production cuts by members of opec followed by a refusal to subsequently increase oil production have tightened world oil markets 
fluctuations in the reserve capacity of crude oil could impact future prices 
in the past  a supply disruption in one area of the world was softened by the ability of major oil producing nations such as saudi arabia to increase output to make up the difference 
now  much of that spare reserve capacity has been absorbed by increased demand 
the current global economic downturn  however  has led to a decrease in the demand for oil that lasted through and a corresponding increase in spare capacities 
according to the united states government s energy information administration  global oil demand is expected to rise by million barrels a day in  to a total global consumption of million barrels per day  up from million barrels per day in daily changes in usbo s per unit nav may not correlate with daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
if this were to occur  investors may not be able to effectively use usbo as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
uscf endeavors to invest usbo s assets as fully as possible in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments so that the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit nav closely correlate with the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
however  daily changes in usbo s per unit nav may not correlate with the daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract for several reasons as set forth below usbo i may not be able to buy sell the exact amount of futures contracts and other crude oil related investments to have a perfect correlation with per unit nav  ii may not always be able to buy and sell futures contracts or other crude oil related investments at the market price  and iii is required to pay fees  including brokerage fees and the management fee  which will have an effect on the correlation 
short term supply and demand for crude oil may cause the changes in the market price of the benchmark futures contract to vary from the changes in usbo s per unit nav if usbo has fully invested in futures contracts that do not reflect such supply and demand and it is unable to replace such contracts with futures contracts that do reflect such supply and demand 

table of contents usbo sells and buys only as many futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that it can to get the daily changes in percentage terms of the per unit nav as close as possible to the daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
the remainder of its assets are invested in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents and are used to satisfy initial margin and additional margin requirements  if any  and to otherwise support its investments in crude oil interests 
investments in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents  both directly and as margin  provide rates of return that vary from changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
because usbo incurs certain expenses in connection with its investment activities  and holds most of its assets in cash and or more liquid short term securities for margin and other liquidity purposes and for redemptions that may be necessary on an ongoing basis  uscf is generally not able to fully invest usbo s assets in futures contracts or other crude oil related investments and there cannot be perfect correlation between changes in usbo s per unit nav and changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
as usbo grows  there may be more or less correlation 
for example  if usbo only has enough money to buy three futures contracts and it needs four contracts to track the price of brent crude oil then the correlation will be lower  but if buys  futures contracts and it needs to buy  contracts then the correlation will be higher 
at certain asset levels  usbo may be limited in its ability to buy or purchase the benchmark futures contract or other futures contracts due to accountability levels imposed by the relevant exchanges 
to the extent that usbo invests in these other futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  the correlation with the benchmark futures contract may be lower 
if usbo is required to invest in other futures contracts and other crude oil related investments that are less correlated with the benchmark futures contract  usbo would likely invest in over the counter contracts to increase the level of correlation of usbo s assets 
over the counter contracts entail certain risks described below under over the counter contract risk 
usbo may not be able to buy the exact number of futures contracts and other crude oil related investments to have a perfect correlation with the benchmark futures contract if the purchase price of the futures contracts required to be fully invested in such contracts is higher than the proceeds received for the sale of a creation basket on the day the basket was sold 
in such case  usbo could not invest the entire proceeds from the purchase of the creation basket in such futures contracts for example  assume usbo receives  for the sale of a creation basket and assume that the price of a futures contract for crude oil is  then usbo could only invest in futures contracts with an aggregate value of  usbo would be required to invest a percentage of the proceeds in cash  treasuries or other liquid securities to be deposited as margin with the futures commission merchant through which the contracts were purchased 
the remainder of the purchase price for the creation basket would remain invested in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents or other liquid securities as determined by uscf from time to time based on factors such as potential calls for margin or anticipated redemptions 
if the trading market for futures contracts is suspended or closed  usbo may not be able to purchase these investments at the last reported price 
if daily changes in usbo s per unit nav do not correlate with daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract  then investing in usbo may not be an effective way to hedge against oil related losses or indirectly invest in oil 

table of contents the benchmark futures contract may not correlate with the spot price of brent crude oil and this could cause changes in the price of the units to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of brent crude oil 
if this were to occur  then investors may not be able to effectively use usbo as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
in addition  the price relationship between the near month contract and the next month contract that compose the benchmark futures contract will vary and may impact both the total return over time of usbo s per unit nav  as well as the degree to which its total return tracks other crude oil price indices total returns 
when using the benchmark futures contract as a strategy to track the spot price of brent crude oil  at best the correlation between changes in prices of such crude oil interests and the spot price of brent crude oil can be only approximate 
the degree of imperfection of correlation depends upon circumstances such as variations in the speculative brent crude oil market  supply of and demand for such crude oil interests and technical influences in futures trading 
if there is a weak correlation between the crude oil interests and the spot price of brent crude oil  then even in situations where there is also tracking among the price of units  the per unit nav of such units and crude oil interests  the price of units may not accurately track the spot price of brent crude oil and investors may not be able to effectively use usbo as a way to hedge the risk of losses in their oil related transactions or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
backwardation and contango may increase usbo s tracking error and or negatively impact total return 
the design of usbo s benchmark futures contract is such that every month it begins by using the near month contract to expire until the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration  when  over a four day period  it transitions to the next month contract to expire as its benchmark contract and keeps that contract as its benchmark until it becomes the near month contract and close to expiration 
in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a higher price than next month to expire contracts  a situation described as backwardation in the futures market  then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark contract would tend to rise as it approaches expiration 
as a result  the total return of the benchmark futures contract would tend to track higher 
conversely  in the event of a crude oil futures market where near month contracts trade at a lower price than next month contracts  a situation described as contango in the futures market  then absent the impact of the overall movement in crude oil prices the value of the benchmark futures contract would tend to decline as it approaches expiration 
as a result the total return of the benchmark futures contract would tend to track lower 
when compared to total return of other price indices  such as the spot price of crude oil  the impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of usbo s per unit nav to vary significantly 
in the event of a prolonged period of contango  and absent the impact of rising or falling oil prices  this could have a significant negative impact on usbo s per unit nav and total return 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the potential effects of contango and backwardation 
usbo may experience a loss if it is required to sell treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired 
the value of treasuries generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates 
if usbo is required to sell treasuries at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired  usbo will experience a loss 
this loss may adversely impact the price of the units and may decrease the correlation among the price of units  the per unit nav of units  the price of the benchmark futures contract and other crude oil related investments  and the spot price of brent crude oil 
certain of usbo s investments could be illiquid which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time 
usbo may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price 
it is difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market 
a market disruption  such as a foreign government taking political actions that disrupt the market in its currency  its crude oil production or exports  or in another major export  can also make it difficult to liquidate a position 
alternatively  limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations  such as accountability levels  position limits and daily price fluctuation limits  may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some commodity interests 

table of contents unexpected market illiquidity may cause major losses to investors at any time or from time to time 
in addition  usbo has not and does not intend at this time to establish a credit facility  which would provide an additional source of liquidity and instead relies only on the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that it holds 
the anticipated large value of the positions in futures contracts that uscf will acquire or enter into for usbo increases the risk of illiquidity 
the other crude oil related investments that usbo invests in  such as negotiated over the counter contracts  may have a greater likelihood of being illiquid since they are contracts between two parties that take into account not only market risk  but also the relative credit  tax  and settlement risks under such contracts 
such contracts also have limited transferability that results from such risks and from the contract s express limitations 
because both futures contracts and other crude oil related investments may be illiquid  usbo s crude oil interests may be more difficult to liquidate at favorable prices in periods of illiquid markets and losses may be incurred during the period in which positions are being liquidated 
if the nature of hedgers and speculators in futures markets has shifted such that crude oil purchasers are the predominant hedgers in the market  usbo might have to reinvest at higher futures prices or choose other crude oil related investments 
the changing nature of the hedgers and speculators in the crude oil market influences whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price 
in order to induce speculators to take the corresponding long side of the same futures contract  crude oil producers must generally be willing to sell futures contracts at prices that are below expected future spot prices 
conversely  if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the crude oil who purchase futures contracts to hedge against a rise in prices  then speculators will only take the short side of the futures contract if the futures price is greater than the expected future spot price of crude oil 
this can have significant implications for usbo when it is time to reinvest the proceeds from a maturing futures contract into a new futures contract 
while usbo does not intend to take physical delivery of crude oil under its futures contracts  physical delivery under such contracts impacts the value of the contracts 
while it is not the current intention of usbo to take physical delivery of crude oil under any of its futures contracts  futures contracts are not required to be cash settled and it is possible to take delivery under some of these contracts 
storage costs associated with purchasing crude oil could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of futures contracts or other crude oil related investments 
storage costs include the time value of money invested in crude oil as a physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the crude oil less any benefits from ownership of crude oil that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract 
in general  futures contracts have a one month delay for contract delivery and the back month the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month includes storage costs 
to the extent that these storage costs change for crude oil while usbo holds futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  the value of the futures contracts or other crude oil related investments  and therefore usbo s nav  may change as well 
regulation of the commodity interests and energy markets is extensive and constantly changing  future regulatory developments are impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect usbo 
the futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes  regulations  and margin requirements 
in addition  the cftc and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency  including  for example  the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements  the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading 
the regulation of commodity interest transactions in the united states is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action 
considerable regulatory attention has been focused on non traditional investment pools that are publicly distributed in the united states 
under the dodd frank act and otherwise  there is a possibility of future regulatory changes within the united states altering  perhaps to a material extent  the nature of an investment in usbo or the ability of usbo to continue to implement its investment strategy 
in addition  various national governments outside of the united states have expressed concern regarding the disruptive effects of speculative trading in the energy markets and the need to regulate the derivatives markets in general 
the effect of any future regulatory change on usbo is impossible to predict  but it could be substantial and adverse 
for a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the cftc and the sec and the potential impacts thereof on usbo  please see item business regulation in this annual report on form k 

table of contents investing in usbo for purposes of hedging may be subject to several risks including the possibility of losing the benefit of favorable market movement 
participants in the crude oil or in other industries may use usbo as a vehicle to hedge the risk of losses in their crude oil related transactions 
there are several risks in connection with using usbo as a hedging device 
while hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices  it can also preclude a hedger s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement 
in a hedging transaction  the hedger may be concerned that the hedged item will increase in price  but must recognize the risk that the price may instead decline and if this happens he will have lost his opportunity to profit from the change in price because the hedging transaction will result in a loss rather than a gain 
thus  the hedger foregoes the opportunity to profit from favorable price movements 
an investment in usbo may provide little or no diversification benefits 
thus  in a declining market  usbo may have no gains to offset losses from other investments  and an investor may suffer losses on an investment in usbo while incurring losses with respect to other asset classes 
historically  futures contracts and other crude oil related investments have generally been non correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds 
non correlation means that there is a low statistically valid relationship between the performance of futures and other commodity interest transactions  on the one hand  and stocks or bonds  on the other hand 
however  there can be no assurance that such non correlation will continue during future periods 
if  contrary to historic patterns  usbo s performance were to move in the same general direction as the financial markets  investors will obtain little or no diversification benefits from an investment in the units 
in such a case  usbo may have no gains to offset losses from other investments  and investors may suffer losses on their investment in usbo at the same time they incur losses with respect to other investments 
variables such as drought  floods  weather  embargoes  tariffs and other political events may have a larger impact on crude oil prices and crude oil linked instruments  including futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  than on traditional securities 
these additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject usbo s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities 
non correlation should not be confused with negative correlation  where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other 
there is no historic evidence that the spot price of crude oil and prices of other financial assets  such as stocks and bonds  are negatively correlated 
in the absence of negative correlation  usbo cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market  or vice versa 
usbo s operating risks usbo is not a registered investment company so unitholders do not have the protections of the act 
usbo is not an investment company subject to the act 
accordingly  investors do not have the protections afforded by that statute which  for example  requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager 
uscf is leanly staffed and relies heavily on key personnel to manage trading activities 
in managing and directing the day to day activities and affairs of usbo  uscf relies heavily on messrs 
howard mah and john hyland 
if messrs 
mah or hyland were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities  it may have an adverse effect on the management of usbo 
furthermore  messrs 
mah and hyland are currently involved in the management of the related public funds 
uscf has also filed registration statements to register units of ussf  ungd  usgo and usabf  each a series of the united states commodity funds trust i 
mr 
mah is also employed by ameristock corporation  a registered investment adviser that manages a public mutual fund 
it is estimated that mr 
mah will spend approximately of his time on usbo and related public fund matters 
mr 
hyland will spend approximately of his time on usbo and related public fund matters 
to the extent that uscf establishes additional funds  even greater demands will be placed on messrs 
mah and hyland  as well as the other officers of uscf and its board 

table of contents accountability levels  position limits  and daily price fluctuation limits set by the exchanges have the potential to cause a tracking error  which could cause the price of units to substantially vary from the price of the benchmark futures contract and prevent investors from being able to effectively use usbo as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
us designated contract markets such as the nymex have established accountability levels and position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control other than as a hedge  which an investment by usbo is not may hold  own or control 
in addition to accountability levels and position limits  the nymex also sets daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts 
the daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day s settlement price 
once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract  no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit 
additionally  on october   the cftc adopted new rules  which establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures contracts including futures contracts and options on futures contracts  executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets ie  certain regulated exchanges and commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options contracts 
the cftc also adopted aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity 
for a more detailed discussion of the position limits to be imposed by the cftc under the dodd frank act and the potential impacts thereof on usbo  please see item business what are futures contracts and regulation in this annual report on form k 
all of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the units and the price of the benchmark futures contract 
this may in turn prevent investors from being able to effectively use usbo as a way to hedge against crude oil related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in crude oil 
usbo has not limited the size of its offering and is committed to utilizing substantially all of its proceeds to purchase futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
if usbo is required to limit or reduce the size of its positions in brent crude oil contracts on the ice futures  it may then  if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements  purchase futures contracts on the nymex or other exchanges that trade listed crude oil futures 
the futures contracts available on the nymex are comparable to the contracts on the ice futures  but they may have different underlying commodities  sizes  deliveries  and prices 
to the extent that uscf uses spreads and straddles as part of its trading strategy  there is the risk that the per unit nav may not closely track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
if uscf were to utilize a spread or straddle position and the spread performed differently than expected  the results could impact usbo s tracking error 
this could affect usbo s investment objective of having its per unit nav closely track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
additionally  a loss on a spread position would negatively impact usbo s absolute return 
for a more detailed discussion regarding spreads and straddles  please see item business spreads and straddles in this annual report on form k 

table of contents usbo and uscf may have conflicts of interest  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of unitholders 
usbo and uscf may have inherent conflicts to the extent uscf attempts to maintain usbo s asset size in order to preserve its fee income and this may not always be consistent with usbo s objective of having the value of its units per unit nav track the changes in the benchmark futures contract 
uscf s officers  directors and employees do not devote their time exclusively to usbo 
these persons are directors  officers or employees of other entities that may compete with usbo for their services 
they could have a conflict between their responsibilities to usbo and to those other entities 
in addition  uscf s principals  officers  directors or employees may trade futures and related contracts for their own account 
a conflict of interest may exist if their trades are in the same markets and at the same time as usbo trades using the clearing broker to be used by usbo 
a potential conflict also may occur if uscf s principals  officers  directors or employees trade their accounts more aggressively or take positions in their accounts which are opposite  or ahead of  the positions taken by usbo 
uscf has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations of usbo  and this may allow it to act in a way that furthers its own interests which may create a conflict with the best interests of investors 
limited partners have limited voting control  which will limit the ability to influence matters such as amendment of the lp agreement  change in usbo s basic investment policy  dissolution of this fund  or the sale or distribution of usbo s assets 
uscf serves as the general partner to each of usbo  usof  usng  usof  uga  usho  usso and usng and the sponsor for usci and cper  and will serve as the sponsor for usmi  usag  ussf  ungd  usgo and usabf  if such funds offer their securities to the public or begin operations 
uscf may have a conflict to the extent that its trading decisions for usbo may be influenced by the effect they would have on the other funds it manages 
these trading decisions may be influenced since uscf also serves as the general partner or sponsor for all of the funds and is required to meet all of the funds investment objectives as well as usbo s 
if uscf believes that a trading decision it made on behalf of usbo might i impede its other funds from reaching their investment objectives  or ii improve the likelihood of meeting its other funds objectives  then uscf may choose to change its trading decision for usbo  which could either impede or improve the opportunity for usbo to meet its investment objective 
in addition  uscf is required to indemnify the officers and directors of its other funds if the need for indemnification arises 
this potential indemnification will cause uscf s assets to decrease 
if uscf s other sources of income are not sufficient to compensate for the indemnification  then uscf may terminate and investors could lose their investment 
unitholders may only vote on the removal of uscf and limited partners have only limited voting rights 
unitholders and limited partners will not participate in the management of usbo and do not control uscf so they will not have influence over basic matters that affect usbo 
in addition  usbo could terminate at any time and cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment and could upset the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio 
limited partners will have limited voting rights with respect to usbo s affairs 
unitholders must apply to become limited partners  and unitholders that have not applied to become limited partners have no voting rights  other than to remove uscf as the general partner of usbo 
even then  unitholders may remove uscf only if of the unitholders elect to do so 
unitholders and limited partners will not be permitted to participate in the management or control of usbo or the conduct of its business 
unitholders and limited partners must therefore rely upon the duties and judgment of uscf to manage usbo s affairs 
usbo may terminate at any time  regardless of whether usbo has incurred losses  subject to the terms of the lp agreement 
in particular  unforeseen circumstances  including the death  adjudication of incompetence  bankruptcy  dissolution  or removal of uscf as the general partner of usbo could cause usbo to terminate unless a majority interest of the limited partners within days of the event elects to continue the partnership and appoints a successor general partner  or the affirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners subject to certain conditions 
however  no level of losses will require uscf to terminate usbo 
usbo s termination would cause the liquidation and potential loss of an investor s investment 
termination could also negatively affect the overall maturity and timing of an investor s investment portfolio 

table of contents uscf may manage a large amount of assets and this could affect usbo s ability to trade profitably 
increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions 
in general  uscf does not intend to limit the amount of assets of usbo that it may manage 
the more assets uscf manages  the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions 
limited partners may have limited liability in certain circumstances  including potentially having liability for the return of wrongful distributions 
under delaware law  a limited partner might be held liable for usbo s obligations as if it were a general partner if the limited partner participates in the control of the partnership s business and the persons who transact business with the partnership think the limited partner is the general partner 
a limited partner will not be liable for assessments in addition to its initial capital investment in any of usbo s capital securities representing units 
however  a limited partner may be required to repay to usbo any amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to it under some circumstances 
under delaware law  usbo may not make a distribution to limited partners if the distribution causes usbo s liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and nonrecourse liabilities to exceed the fair value of usbo s assets 
delaware law provides that a limited partner who receives such a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution violated the law will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution 
with adequate notice  a limited partner may be required to withdraw from the partnership for any reason 
if uscf gives at least fifteen days written notice to a limited partner  then uscf may for any reason  in its sole discretion  require any such limited partner to withdraw entirely from the partnership or to withdraw a portion of its partner capital account 
uscf may require withdrawal even in situations where the limited partner has complied completely with the provisions of the lp agreement 
usbo does not expect to make cash distributions 
usbo has not previously made any cash distributions and intends to re invest any realized gains in additional crude oil interests rather than distributing cash to limited partners 
therefore  unlike mutual funds  commodity pools or other investment pools that actively manage their investments in an attempt to realize income and gains from their investing activities and distribute such income and gains to their investors  usbo generally does not expect to distribute cash to limited partners 
an investor should not invest in usbo if it will need cash distributions from usbo to pay taxes on its share of income and gains of usbo  if any  or for any other reason 
although usbo does not intend to make cash distributions  the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution  eg  at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in crude oil interests and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax 
if this income becomes significant then cash distributions may be made 
there is a risk that usbo will not earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for the fees and expenses that it must pay and as such usbo may not earn any profit 
usbo pays brokerage charges of approximately of average total net assets based on futures commission merchant fees of per buy or sell  management fees of of nav on its average total net assets  and over the counter spreads and extraordinary expenses eg  subsequent offering expenses  other expenses not in the ordinary course of business  including the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and required under the lp agreement and under agreements entered into by uscf on usbo s behalf and the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation that cannot be quantified 

table of contents these fees and expenses must be paid in all cases regardless of whether usbo s activities are profitable 
accordingly  usbo must earn trading gains sufficient to compensate for these fees and expenses before it can earn any profit 
if offerings of the units do not raise sufficient funds to pay usbo s future expenses and no other source of funding of expenses is found  usbo may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
prior to the offering of units that commenced on june   all of usbo s expenses were funded by uscf and its affiliates 
these payments by uscf and its affiliates were designed to allow usbo the ability to commence the public offering of its units 
usbo now directly pays certain of these fees and expenses 
uscf will continue to pay other fees and expenses  as set forth in the lp agreement 
if uscf and usbo are unable to raise sufficient funds to cover their expenses or locate any other source of funding  usbo may be forced to terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
usbo may incur higher fees and expenses upon renewing existing or entering into new contractual relationships 
the clearing arrangements between the clearing brokers and usbo generally are terminable by the clearing brokers once the clearing broker has given usbo notice 
upon termination  uscf may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if usbo intends to continue trading in futures contracts or other crude oil related investments at its present level of capacity 
the services of any clearing broker may not be available  or even if available  these services may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated clearing arrangements 
usbo may miss certain trading opportunities because it will not receive the benefit of the expertise of independent trading advisors 
uscf does not employ trading advisors for usbo  however  it reserves the right to employ them in the future 
the only advisor to usbo is uscf 
a lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to usbo because it will not receive the benefit of a trading advisor s expertise 
an unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the nav of usbo 
if a substantial number of requests for redemption of redemption baskets are received by usbo during a relatively short period of time  usbo may not be able to satisfy the requests from usbo s assets not committed to trading 
as a consequence  it could be necessary to liquidate positions in usbo s trading positions before the time that the trading strategies would otherwise dictate liquidation 
the financial markets are currently in a period of disruption and usbo does not expect these conditions to improve in the near future 
since  the financial markets have experienced very difficult conditions and volatility as well as significant adverse trends 
the conditions in these markets have resulted in a decrease in availability of corporate credit and liquidity and have led indirectly to the insolvency  closure or acquisition of a number of major financial institutions and have contributed to further consolidation within the financial services industry 
in addition  the administration and congress have periodically been reaching impasses in passing a fiscal budget  which could create long term concerns regarding the credit of the united states and interest earned  as well as the united states government s ability to pay its obligations to holders of treasuries 
if low interest rates on treasuries continues or if usbo is not able to redeem its investments in treasuries prior to maturity and the us government cannot pay its obligations  usbo would be negatively impacted 
in addition  usbo might also be negatively impacted by its use of money market mutual funds to the extent those funds might themselves be using treasuries 
although the financial markets saw signs of recovery beginning in late  economic growth in and early has been slow and the financial markets are still fragile and could fall into another recession 
another recession could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of usof s service providers and authorized purchasers  which would impact the ability of uscf to achieve usbo s investment objective 

table of contents the failure or bankruptcy of a clearing broker or usbo s custodian could result in a substantial loss of usbo s assets and could impair usbo in its ability to execute trades 
under cftc regulations  a clearing broker maintains customers assets in a bulk segregated account 
if a clearing broker fails to do so  or even if the customers funds are segregated by the clearing broker but the clearing broker is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account  the clearing broker s other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker s bankruptcy 
in that event  the clearing broker s customers  such as usbo  are entitled to recover  even in respect of property specifically traceable to them  only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker s customers 
the bankruptcy of a clearing broker could result in the complete loss of usbo s assets posted with the clearing broker  though the majority of usbo s assets are held in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents with the custodian and would not be impacted by the bankruptcy of a clearing broker 
usbo also may be subject to the risk of the failure of  or delay in performance by  any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations  if any  on which commodity interest contracts are traded 
in addition  to the extent usbo s clearing broker is required to post usbo s assets as margin to a clearinghouse  the margin will be maintained in an omnibus account containing the margin of all of the clearing broker s customers 
if usbo s clearing broker defaults to a clearinghouse because of a default by one of the clearing broker s other customers or otherwise  then the clearinghouse can look to all of the margin in the omnibus account  including margin posted by usbo and any other non defaulting customers of the clearing broker to satisfy the obligations of the clearing broker 
from time to time  the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business 
a clearing broker s involvement in costly or time consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker s trading operations  which could impair the clearing broker s ability to successfully execute and clear usbo s trades 
in addition  the majority of usbo s assets are held in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents with the custodian 
the insolvency of the custodian could result in a complete loss of usbo s assets held by that custodian  which  at any given time  would likely comprise a substantial portion of usbo s total assets 
third parties may infringe upon or otherwise violate intellectual property rights or assert that uscf has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights  which may result in significant costs and diverted attention 
third parties may utilize usbo s intellectual property or technology  including the use of its business methods  trademarks and trading program software  without permission 
uscf has a patent for usbo s business method and it has registered its trademarks 
usbo does not currently have any proprietary software 
however  if it obtains proprietary software in the future  then any unauthorized use of usbo s proprietary software and other technology could also adversely affect its competitive advantage 
usbo may not have adequate resources to implement procedures for monitoring unauthorized uses of its patents  trademarks  proprietary software and other technology 
also  third parties may independently develop business methods  trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of uscf or claim that uscf has violated their intellectual property rights  including their copyrights  trademark rights  trade names  trade secrets and patent rights 
as a result  uscf may have to litigate in the future to protect its trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights  defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties rights  or defend itself against claims that its rights are invalid 
any litigation of this type  even if uscf is successful and regardless of the merits  may result in significant costs  divert its resources from usbo  or require it to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 

table of contents the success of usbo depends on the ability of uscf to accurately implement trading systems  and any failure to do so could subject usbo to losses on such transactions 
uscf uses mathematical formulas built into a generally available spreadsheet program to decide whether it should buy or sell crude oil interests each day 
specifically  uscf uses the spreadsheet to make mathematical calculations and to monitor positions in crude oil interests and treasuries and correlations to the benchmark futures contract 
uscf must accurately process the spreadsheets outputs and execute the transactions called for by the formulas 
in addition  usbo relies on uscf to properly operate and maintain its computer and communications systems 
extraordinary transaction volume  hardware or software failure  power or telecommunications failure  a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail 
any significant degradation or failure of the systems that uscf uses to gather and analyze information  enter orders  process data  monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions  liability to other parties  lost profit opportunities  damages to uscf s and usbo s reputations  increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources 
any failure  inaccuracy or delay in implementing any of the formulas or systems  including implementing upgrades and compatibility with the computer systems of third parties  and executing usbo s transactions could impair its ability to achieve usbo s investment objective 
it could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information 
this could cause substantial losses on transactions 
the occurrence of a terrorist attack  or the outbreak  continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities could disrupt usbo s trading activity and materially affect usbo s profitability 
the operations of usbo  the exchanges  brokers and counterparties with which usbo does business  and the markets in which usbo does business could be severely disrupted in the event of a major terrorist attack or the outbreak  continuation or expansion of war or other hostilities 
global anti terrorism initiatives  political unrest in the middle east and southeast asia  as well as political hostility towards the united states  continue to fuel this concern 
risk of leverage and volatility if uscf permits usbo to become leveraged  investors could lose all or substantially all of their investment if usbo s trading positions suddenly turn unprofitable 
commodity pools trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract s or other commodity interests entire market value 
this feature permits commodity pools to leverage their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts or other commodity interests with an aggregate value in excess of the commodity pool s assets 
while this leverage can increase the pool s profits  relatively small adverse movements in the price of the pool s futures contracts can cause significant losses to the pool 
while uscf has not and does not currently intend to leverage usbo s assets  it is not prohibited from doing so under the lp agreement or otherwise 
the price of crude oil is volatile which could cause large fluctuations in the price of units 
movements in the price of crude oil may be the result of factors outside of uscf s control and may not be anticipated by uscf 
among the factors that can cause volatility in the price of crude oil are worldwide or regional demand for energy  which is affected by economic conditions  the domestic and foreign supply and inventories of oil and gas  weather conditions  including abnormally mild winter or summer weather  and abnormally harsh winter or summer weather  availability and adequacy of pipeline and other transportation facilities  availability of storage facilities  
table of contents domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  political conditions in gas or oil producing regions  technological advances relating to energy usage or relating to technology for exploration  production  refining and petrochemical manufacturing  the ability of members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the impact of environmental and other government regulations 
over the counter contract risk currently  over the counter transactions are subject to little regulation 
a portion of usbo s assets may be used to trade over the counter contracts  such as forward contracts or swap or spot contracts 
currently  over the counter contracts are typically contracts traded on a principal to principal basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the dodd frank act had been essentially unregulated by the cftc 
the markets for over the counter contracts have relied upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the cftc on participants in the futures markets 
while the dodd frank act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over the counter market  the current regulation of the over the counter contracts could expose usbo in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants 
see item business regulation for a discussion of how the over the counter market will be subject to much more extensive cftc oversight and regulation after the implementation of the dodd frank act 
usbo will be subject to credit risk with respect to counterparties to over the counter contracts entered into by usbo or held by special purpose or structured vehicles 
usbo faces the risk of non performance by the counterparties to the over the counter contracts 
unlike in futures contracts  the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution  rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions 
as a result  there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions 
a counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to usbo  in which case usbo could suffer significant losses on these contracts 
if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties  usbo may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding 
usbo may obtain only limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances 
usbo may be subject to liquidity risk with respect to its over the counter contracts 
over the counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange  do not have uniform terms and conditions  and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support  such as collateral  and in general  they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty 
these conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and could adversely impact usbo s ability to realize the full value of such contracts 
in addition  even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk  sudden changes in the value of over the counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations 

table of contents in general  valuing over the counter derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such over the counter derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated  and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources 
in addition  while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating over the counter contracts  they typically are not contractually obligated to do so  particularly if they are not a party to the transaction 
as a result  it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding over the counter derivatives transaction 
risk of trading in international markets trading in international markets could expose usbo to credit and regulatory risk 
usbo invests primarily in futures contracts  a significant portion of which are traded on exchanges outside the united states  including the ice futures 
some non us markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their us counterparts 
the cftc  nfa and the domestic exchanges have little  if any  regulatory authority over the activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges  including the execution  delivery and clearing of transactions  and have little  if any  power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non us laws 
similarly  the rights of market participants  such as usbo  in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non us market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of us markets or brokers 
as a result  in these markets  usbo has less legal and regulatory protection than it does when it trades domestically 
in some of these non us markets  the performance on a contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes usbo to credit risk 
however  futures contracts traded on the ice futures  including the benchmark futures contract  are backed by the ice futures and may not expose usbo to the risks of some other non us exchanges or clearing corporations that do not have similar backing 
trading in non us markets also leaves usbo susceptible to swings in the value of the local currency against the us dollar 
the benchmark futures contract  however  is traded in us dollars and does not expose usbo to the risk of currency fluctuations 
additionally  trading on non us exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls  expropriation  increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability 
an adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets 
usbo s international trading could expose it to losses resulting from non us exchanges that are less developed or less reliable than united states exchanges 
some non us exchanges may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics 
in addition  usbo may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders  and the historical market data on which uscf bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for us exchanges 
tax risk an investor s tax liability may exceed the amount of distributions  if any  on its units 
cash or property will be distributed at the sole discretion of uscf 
uscf has not and does not currently intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to units 
investors will be required to pay us federal income tax and  in some cases  state  local  or foreign income tax  on their allocable share of usbo s taxable income  without regard to whether they receive distributions or the amount of any distributions 
therefore  the tax liability of an investor with respect to its units may exceed the amount of cash or value of property if any distributed 

table of contents an investor s allocable share of taxable income or loss may differ from its economic income or loss on its units 
due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by usbo in making allocations for tax purposes and other factors  an investor s allocable share of usbo s income  gain  deduction or loss may be different than its economic profit or loss from its units for a taxable year 
this difference could be temporary or permanent and  if permanent  could result in it being taxed on amounts in excess of its economic income 
items of income  gain  deduction  loss and credit with respect to units could be reallocated if the irs does not accept the assumptions and conventions applied by usbo in allocating those items  with potential adverse consequences for an investor 
the us tax rules pertaining to partnerships are complex and their application to large  publicly traded partnerships such as usbo is in many respects uncertain 
usbo applies certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income  gains  deductions  losses and credits in a manner that properly reflects unitholders economic gains and losses 
these assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the internal revenue code the code and applicable treasury regulations  however  and it is possible that the us internal revenue service will successfully challenge usbo s allocation methods and require usbo to reallocate items of income  gain  deduction  loss or credit in a manner that adversely affects investors 
if this occurs  investors may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest 
usbo could be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  which may substantially reduce the value of the units 
usbo has received an opinion of counsel that  under current us federal income tax laws  usbo will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  provided that i at least percent of usbo s annual gross income consists of qualifying income as defined in the code  ii usbo is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law and iii usbo does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
although uscf anticipates that usbo has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the qualifying income requirement for all of its taxable years  that result cannot be assured 
usbo has not requested and will not request any ruling from the irs with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
if the irs were to successfully assert that usbo is taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes in any taxable year  rather than passing through its income  gains  losses and deductions proportionately to unitholders  usbo would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates 
in addition  although uscf does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to units  any distributions would be taxable to unitholders as dividend income 
taxation of usbo as a corporation could materially reduce the after tax return on an investment in units and could substantially reduce the value of the units

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of usbo included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
forward looking information this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations

introduction usbo  a delaware limited partnership  is a commodity pool that issues units that may be purchased and sold on the nyse arca 
the investment objective of usbo is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its per unit nav to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of brent crude oil  as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for brent crude oil traded on the ice futures that is the near month contract to expire  except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration  in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire the benchmark futures contract  less usbo s expenses 
near month contract means the next contract traded on the ice futures due to expire 
next month contract means the first contract traded on the ice futures due to expire after the near month contract 
it is not the intent of usbo to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit nav will equal  in dollar terms  the spot price of light  sweet crude oil or any particular futures contract based on light  sweet crude oil 
it is not the intent of usbo to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day 
uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
usbo seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a combination of futures contracts and other crude oil related investments such that changes in its per unit nav  measured in percentage terms  will closely track the changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract  also measured in percentage terms 
uscf believes the daily changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract have historically exhibited a close correlation with the daily changes in the spot price of brent crude oil 
it is not the intent of usbo to be operated in a fashion such that the per unit nav will equal  in dollar terms  the spot price of brent crude oil or any particular futures contract based on brent crude oil 
it is not the intent of usbo to be operated in a fashion such that its per unit nav will reflect the percentage change of the price of any particular futures contract as measured over a time period greater than one day 
uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in future contracts and other crude oil related investments 

table of contents the regulation of commodity interests in the united states is subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action 
on july   a broad financial regulatory reform bill  the dodd frank act  was signed into law 
all of the dodd frank act s provisions became effective on july  however  some new rules implementing  and in many cases  interpreting and clarifying  the dodd frank act s new requirements have not been completely finalized and have been challenged in court 
pending final resolution of all applicable regulatory requirements  some specific examples of how the new dodd frank act provisions and rules adopted thereunder could impact usbo are discussed in item business and itema 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
price movements brent crude oil futures prices exhibited moderate daily swings along with an uneven upward trend during the year ended december  the price of the benchmark futures contract started the year at per barrel 
the benchmark futures contract reached its high for the year on april   at per barrel and reached its low for the year on january  when the price dropped to per barrel 
the year ended with the benchmark futures contract at per barrel  up approximately over the year 
usbo s per unit nav began the year at and ended the year at on december   an increase of approximately over the year 
usbo s per unit nav reached its high for the period on april  at and reached its low for the year on january  at 
the benchmark futures contract prices listed above began with the february contract and ended with the february contract 
the return of approximately on the benchmark futures contract listed above is a hypothetical return only and could not actually be achieved by an investor holding futures contracts 
an investment in futures contracts would need to be rolled forward during the time period described in order to achieve such a result 
furthermore  the change in the nominal price of these differing crude oil futures contracts  measured from the start of the year to the end of the year  does not represent the actual benchmark results that usbo seeks to track  which are more fully described below  in the section titled tracking usbo s benchmark 
during the year ended december   the level of contango in us crude oil markets remained mildly steep  meaning that the price of the near month crude oil futures contract was less than the price of the next month crude oil futures contract  or contracts further away from expiration 
crude oil inventories in the united states  which reached historic levels in january and february and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango  began to drop in march and continued to drop for the remainder of and the beginning of during the year ended december   crude oil inventories began to climb higher  however  beginning mid inventories outside the us have drawn to their lowest levels in nine years 
although the market is tight  global markets are keeping prices low and the futures market in contango  when otherwise  due to inventory  it would be more in a backwardation environment 
the brent crude oil futures market did not experience the steep levels of contango seen in the united states during the year ended december  the brent crude oil futures market moved into a very mild backwardation through the end of december for a discussion of the impact of backwardation and contango on total returns  see term structure of crude oil prices and the impact on total returns below 
valuation of futures contracts and the computation of the per unit nav the per unit nav of usbo s units is calculated once each nyse arca trading day 
the per unit nav for a particular trading day is released after pm new york time 
trading during the core trading session on the nyse arca typically closes at pm new york time 
the administrator uses the ice futures settlement price a weighted average price of trades during a three minute settlement period from pm to pm new york time for the contracts held on the ice futures  but calculates or determines the value of all other usbo investments  including nymex contracts or other futures contracts  as of the earlier of the close of the nyse arca or pm new york time 

table of contents results of operations and the crude oil market results of operations 
on june   usbo listed its units on the nyse arca under the ticker symbol bno 
on that day  usbo established its initial offering price at per unit and issued  units to the initial authorized purchaser  merrill lynch professional clearing corp  in exchange for  in cash 
since its initial offering of  units  usbo has not registered any subsequent offerings of its units 
as of december   usbo had issued  units   of which were outstanding 
as of december   there were  units registered but not yet issued 
more units may have been issued by usbo than are outstanding due to the redemption of units 
unlike funds that are registered under the act  units that have been redeemed by usbo cannot be resold by usbo 
as a result  usbo contemplates that additional offerings of its units will be registered with the sec in the future in anticipation of additional issuances and redemptions 
for the year ended december  compared to the period from june  through december  since usbo commenced operations on june   the comparison of usbo s results of operations for the period from june  to december  and the year ended december  may not be meaningful

the increase in cash assets in overnight deposits  treasuries and money market funds for december   as compared to december   was the result of usbo s greater size in the current period as measured by total net assets 
the ending per unit nav on december  was 
the increase in the per unit nav for december   as compared to december   was primarily due to the rise in the price of the futures contracts during the year ended december  portfolio expenses 
usbo s expenses consist of investment management fees  brokerage fees and commissions  certain offering costs  the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf and expenses relating to tax accounting and reporting requirements 
the management fee that usbo pays to uscf is calculated as a percentage of the total net assets of usbo

however  there can be no assurance that commission costs and portfolio turnover will not cause commission expenses to rise in future quarters 
the fees and expenses associated with usbo s audit expenses and tax accounting and reporting requirements are paid by usbo 
these costs are estimated to be  for the year ended december  uscf  though under no obligation to do so  agreed to pay certain expenses normally borne by usbo  to the extent that such expenses exceed basis points of usbo s nav  on an annualized basis  through at least june  uscf has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods 
dividend and interest income 
usbo seeks to invest its assets such that it holds futures contracts and other crude oil related investments in an amount equal to the total net assets of its portfolio 
typically  such investments do not require usbo to pay the full amount of the contract value at the time of purchase  but rather require usbo to post an amount as a margin deposit against the eventual settlement of the contract 
as a result  usbo retains an amount that is approximately equal to its total net assets  which usbo invests in treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents

uscf seeks to manage usbo s portfolio such that changes in its average daily per unit nav  on a percentage basis  closely track the changes in the average daily price of the benchmark futures contract  also on a percentage basis 
specifically  uscf seeks to manage the portfolio such that over any rolling period of valuation days  the average daily change in usbo s per unit nav is within a range of to to of the average daily change in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
as an example  if the average daily movement of the price of the benchmark futures contract for a particular valuation day time period was per day  uscf would attempt to manage the portfolio such that the average daily movement of the per unit nav during that same time period fell between and ie  between and of the benchmark s results 
usbo s portfolio management goals do not include trying to make the nominal price of usbo s per unit nav equal to the nominal price of the current benchmark futures contract or the spot price for brent crude oil 
uscf believes that it is not practical to manage the portfolio to achieve such an investment goal when investing in listed futures contracts 
for the valuation days ended december   the simple average daily change in the benchmark futures contract was  while the simple average daily change in the per unit nav of usbo over the same time period was

table of contents logo past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results logo past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results 
table of contents an alternative tracking measurement of the return performance of usbo versus the return of its benchmark futures contract can be calculated by comparing the actual return of usbo  measured by changes in its per unit nav  versus the expected changes in its per unit nav under the assumption that usbo s returns had been exactly the same as the daily changes in its benchmark futures contract 
for the year ended december   the actual total return of usbo as measured by changes in its per unit nav was 
this is based on an initial per unit nav of on december  and an ending per unit nav as of december  of 
during this time period  usbo made no distributions to its unitholders 
however  if usbo s daily changes in its per unit nav had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the benchmark futures contract  usbo would have had an estimated per unit nav of as of december   for a total return over the relevant time period of 
the difference between the actual per unit nav total return of usbo of and the expected total return based on the benchmark futures contract of was an error over the time period of  which is to say that usbo s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage 
uscf believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that usbo pays  offset in part by the income that usbo collects on its cash and cash equivalent holdings 
during the year ended december   usbo received dividend and interest income of  which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of for such period 
during the year ended december   usbo also collected  from its authorized purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units 
this income contributed to usbo s actual total return 
during the year ended december   usbo incurred net expenses of  income from dividends and interest and authorized purchaser collections net of expenses was  which is equivalent to a weighted average net income rate of for the year ended december  by comparison  for the period ended december   the actual total return of usbo as measured by changes in its per unit nav was 
this was based on an initial per unit nav of on june  and an ending per unit nav as of december  of 
during this time period  usbo made no distributions to its unitholders 
however  if usbo s daily changes in its per unit nav had instead exactly tracked the changes in the daily total return of the benchmark futures contract  usbo would have had an estimated per unit nav of as of december   for a total return over the relevant time period of 
the difference between the actual per unit nav total return of usbo of and the expected total return based on the benchmark futures contract of was an error over the time period of  which is to say that usbo s actual total return underperformed the benchmark result by that percentage 
uscf believes that a portion of the difference between the actual total return and the expected benchmark total return can be attributed to the net impact of the expenses that usbo paid  offset in part by the income that usbo collected on its cash and cash equivalent holdings 
during the period ended december   usbo received dividend and interest income of  which is equivalent to a weighted average income rate of for such period 
during the period ended december   usbo did not collect income from its authorized purchasers for creating or redeeming baskets of units 
during the period ended december   usbo incurred net expenses of  income from dividends and interest net of expenses was  which is equivalent to an annualized weighted average net income rate of for the period ended december  there are currently three factors that have impacted or are most likely to impact usbo s ability to accurately track its benchmark futures contract 
first  usbo may buy or sell its holdings in the then current benchmark futures contract at a price other than the closing settlement price of that contract on the day during which usbo executes the trade 
in that case  usbo may pay a price that is higher  or lower  than that of the benchmark futures contract  which could cause the changes in the daily per unit nav of usbo to either be too high or too low relative to the daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
during the year ended december   uscf attempted to minimize the effect of these transactions by seeking to execute its purchase or sale of the benchmark futures contract at  or as close as possible to  the end of the day settlement price 
however  it may not always be possible for usbo to obtain the closing settlement price and there is no assurance that failure to obtain the closing settlement price in the future will not adversely impact usbo s attempt to track the benchmark futures contract over time 

table of contents second  usbo earns dividend and interest income on its cash and cash equivalents 
usbo is not required to distribute any portion of its income to its unitholders and did not make any distributions to unitholders during the year ended december  interest payments  and any other income  were retained within the portfolio and added to usbo s nav 
when this income exceeds the level of usbo s expenses for its management fee  brokerage commissions and other expenses including ongoing registration fees and the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf  usbo will realize a net yield that will tend to cause daily changes in the per unit nav of usbo to track slightly higher than daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
during the year ended december   usbo earned  on an annualized basis  approximately on its cash and cash equivalent holdings 
it also incurred cash expenses on an annualized basis of for management fees and approximately in brokerage commission costs related to the purchase and sale of futures contracts  and for other expenses 
the foregoing fees and expenses resulted in a net yield on an annualized basis of approximately and affected usbo s ability to track its benchmark 
if short term interest rates rise above the current levels  the level of deviation created by the yield would decrease 
conversely  if short term interest rates were to decline  the amount of error created by the yield would increase 
when short term yields drop to a level lower than the combined expenses of the management fee and the brokerage commissions  then the tracking error becomes a negative number and would tend to cause the daily returns of the per unit nav to underperform the daily returns of the benchmark futures contract 
third  usbo may hold other crude oil related investments in its portfolio that may fail to closely track the benchmark futures contract s total return movements 
in that case  the error in tracking the benchmark futures contract could result in daily changes in the per unit nav of usbo that are either too high  or too low  relative to the daily changes in the benchmark futures contract 
during the year ended december   usbo did not hold any other crude oil related investments 
if usbo increases in size  and due to its obligations to comply with regulatory limits  usbo may invest in other crude oil related investments which may have the effect of increasing transaction related expenses and may result in increased tracking error 
term structure of crude oil futures prices and the impact on total returns 
several factors determine the total return from investing in a futures contract position 
one factor that impacts the total return that will result from investing in near month futures contracts and rolling those contracts forward each month is the price relationship between the current near month contract and the next month contract 
for example  if the price of the near month contract is higher than the next month contract a situation referred to as backwardation in the futures market  then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to rise in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration 
conversely  if the price of a near month contract is lower than the next month contract a situation referred to as contango in the futures market  then absent any other change there is a tendency for the price of a next month contract to decline in value as it becomes the near month contract and approaches expiration 
as an example  assume that the price of crude oil for immediate delivery the spot price  was per barrel  and the value of a position in the near month futures contract was also over time  the price of the barrel of crude oil will fluctuate based on a number of market factors  including demand for oil relative to its supply 
the value of the near month contract will likewise fluctuate in reaction to a number of market factors 
if investors seek to maintain their position in a near month contract and not take delivery of the oil  every month they must sell their current near month contract as it approaches expiration and invest in the next month contract 
if the futures market is in backwardation  eg  when the expected price of crude oil in the future would be less  the investor would be buying a next month contract for a lower price than the current near month contract 
using the per barrel price above to represent the front month price  the price of the next month contract could be per barrel  that is  cheaper than the front month contract 
hypothetically  and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price  the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and or cash equivalents  the value of the next month contract would rise as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of in this example  the value of an investment in the second month contract would tend to rise faster than the spot price of crude oil  or fall slower 
as a result  it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen after some period of time  while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract would have risen  assuming backwardation is large enough or enough time has elapsed 
similarly  the spot price of crude oil could have fallen while the value of an investment in the futures contract could have fallen only 
over time  if backwardation remained constant  the difference would continue to increase 

table of contents if the futures market is in contango  the investor would be buying a next month contract for a higher price than the current near month contract 
using again the per barrel price above to represent the front month price  the price of the next month contract could be per barrel  that is  more expensive than the front month contract 
hypothetically  and assuming no other changes to either prevailing crude oil prices or the price relationship between the spot price  the near month contract and the next month contract and ignoring the impact of commission costs and the income earned on cash and or cash equivalents  the value of the next month contract would fall as it approaches expiration and becomes the new near month contract with a price of in this example  it would mean that the value of an investment in the second month would tend to rise slower than the spot price of crude oil  or fall faster 
as a result  it would be possible in this hypothetical example for the spot price of crude oil to have risen after some period of time  while the value of the investment in the second month futures contract will have risen only  assuming contango is large enough or enough time has elapsed 
similarly  the spot price of crude oil could have fallen while the value of an investment in the second month futures contract could have fallen 
over time  if contango remained constant  the difference would continue to increase 
the chart below compares the price of the near month contract to the average price of the near month contracts over the last years 
when the price of the near month contract is higher than the average price of the near month contracts  the market would be described as being in backwardation 
when the price of the near month contract is lower than the average price of the near month contracts  the market would be described as being in contango 
although the prices of the near month contract and the average price of the near month contracts do tend to move up or down together  it can be seen that at times the near month prices are clearly higher than the average price of the near month contracts backwardation  and other times they are below the average price of the near month contracts contango 

table of contents logo past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results an alternative way to view the same data is to subtract from the dollar price of the near month contract the average dollar price of the near months contracts for brent crude oil 
if the resulting number is a positive number  then the near month price is higher than the average price of the near months contracts and the market could be described as being in backwardation 
if the resulting number is a negative number  then the near month price is lower than the average price of the near months contracts and the market could be described as being in contango 
the chart below shows the results from subtracting the average dollar price of the near month contracts from the near month price for the year period between and 
table of contents logo past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results historically  the crude oil futures markets have experienced periods of contango and backwardation  with backwardation being in place more often than contango 
during and the first half of  these markets experienced contango 
however  starting early in the third quarter of  the crude oil futures market moved into backwardation 
the crude oil markets remained in backwardation until late in the second quarter of when they moved into contango 
the crude oil markets remained in contango until late in the third quarter of  when the markets moved into backwardation 
early in the fourth quarter of  the crude oil market moved back into contango and remained in contango for the balance of throughout  the crude oil market remained in contango 
during parts of january and february  the level of contango was unusually steep 
crude oil inventories  which reached historic levels in january and february and which appeared to be the primary cause of the steep level of contango  began to drop in march and continued to drop for the balance of and the beginning of the crude oil futures market remained in contango through and the brent crude oil futures market experiences the same effects of contango and backwardation as the united states crude oil futures market  but the brent crude oil futures market has not historically experienced the same level of steepness in contango and backwardation as the united states crude oil futures market 
as of december   us crude oil markets remained mildly in contango while the market for brent crude oil was mildly in backwardation 
periods of contango or backwardation do not materially impact usbo s investment objective of having the percentage changes in its per unit nav track the daily percentage changes in the price of the benchmark futures contract since the impact of backwardation and contango tend to equally impact the daily percentage changes in price of both usbo s units and the benchmark futures contract 
it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether backwardation or contango will occur in the future 
it is likely that both conditions will occur during different periods 

table of contents brent crude oil market 
during the year ended december   brent crude oil prices were impacted by several factors 
on the consumption side  demand increased inside and outside the united states as global economic growth  including emerging economies such as china and india  continued to improve during on the supply side  efforts to reduce production by opec to more closely match global consumption were partially successful 
in the summer of  production was also disrupted by political unrest in the middle east  particularly libya  which reduced global supply by approximately million barrels per day 
on june   the united states and other industrial nations announced the release of million barrels of crude oil from strategic stockpiles in an effort to reduce the price of fuel 
this announcement briefly lowered the price of crude oil  but the release of oil from strategic stockpiles did not in and of itself have an impact on the price of crude oil as of december  brent crude oil prices finished approximately higher than at the beginning of the year  as the global economy continues to adjust to periods of slow recovery and economic growth 
uscf believes that should the global economic situation cease to improve  or decline  there is a meaningful possibility that crude oil prices could further retreat from their current levels 
brent crude oil price movements in comparison to other energy commodities and investment categories 
uscf believes that investors frequently measure the degree to which prices or total returns of one investment or asset class move up or down in value in concert with another investment or asset class 
statistically  such a measure is usually done by measuring the correlation of the price movements of the two different investments or asset classes over some period of time 
the correlation is scaled between and  where indicates that the two investment options move up or down in price or value together  known as positive correlation  and indicates that they move in completely opposite directions  known as negative correlation 
a correlation of would mean that the movements of the two are neither positively nor negatively correlated  known as non correlation 
that is  the investment options sometimes move up and down together and other times move in opposite directions 
for the ten year time period between and  the chart below compares the monthly movements of brent crude oil prices versus the monthly movements of the prices of several other energy commodities  such as natural gas  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline  as well as several major non commodity investment asset classes  such as large cap us equities  us government bonds and global equities 
it can be seen that over this particular time period  the movement of brent crude oil on a monthly basis was not strongly correlated  positively or negatively  with the movements of large cap us equities  global equities or us government bonds 
however  movements in brent crude oil had a strong positive correlation to movements in unleaded gasoline and us west texas intermediate wti crude oil 
brent crude oil was also positively  yet mildly correlated with heating oil

over the one year period ended december   brent crude oil had a positive correlation with west texas intermediate crude oil as well as unleaded gasoline 
brent crude oil continued to have a positive  yet mild  correlation with heating oil 
the correlation between brent crude oil and both large cap us equities and global equities  which had been essentially non correlated over the ten year period ended december   displayed results that indicated that they had a strong positive correlation over this shorter time period 
finally  the results showed that brent crude oil and us government bonds  which had essentially been non correlated for the ten year period ended december   were negatively correlated over this more recent time period

table of contents investors are cautioned that the historical price relationships between brent crude oil and various other energy commodities  as well as other investment asset classes  as measured by correlation may not be reliable predictors of future price movements and correlation results 
the results pictured above would have been different if a different range of dates had been selected 
uscf believes that brent crude oil has historically not demonstrated a strong correlation with equities or bonds over long periods of time 
however  uscf also believes that in the future it is possible that brent crude oil could have long term correlation results that indicate prices of brent crude oil more closely track the movements of equities or bonds 
in addition  uscf believes that  when measured over time periods shorter than ten years  there will always be some periods where the correlation of brent crude oil to equities and bonds will be either more strongly positively correlated or more strongly negatively correlated than the long term historical results suggest 
the correlations between brent crude oil  wti crude oil  heating oil and gasoline are relevant because uscf endeavors to invest usbo s assets in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments so that daily changes in percentage terms in usbo s per unit nav correlate as closely as possible with daily changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract 
if certain other fuel based commodity futures contracts do not closely correlate with the futures contract  then their use could lead to greater tracking error 
as noted above  uscf also believes that the changes in percentage terms in the price of the benchmark futures contract will closely correlate with changes in percentage terms in the spot price of brent crude oil 
critical accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
usbo s application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used 
uscf has evaluated the nature and types of estimates that it makes in preparing usbo s financial statements and related disclosures and has determined that the valuation of its investments which are not traded on a united states or internationally recognized futures exchange such as forward contracts and over the counter contracts involves a critical accounting policy 
the values which are used by usbo for its futures contracts are provided by its commodity broker who uses market prices when available  while over the counter contracts are valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date and valued on a daily basis 
in addition  usbo estimates interest and dividend income on a daily basis using prevailing rates earned on its cash and cash equivalents 
these estimates are adjusted to the actual amount received on a monthly basis and the difference  if any  is not considered material 
liquidity and capital resources usbo has not made  and does not anticipate making  use of borrowings or other lines of credit to meet its obligations 
usbo has met  and it is anticipated that usbo will continue to meet  its liquidity needs in the normal course of business from the proceeds of the sale of its investments  or from the treasuries  cash and or cash equivalents that it intends to hold at all times 
usbo s liquidity needs include redeeming units  providing margin deposits for its existing futures contracts or the purchase of additional futures contracts and posting collateral for its over the counter contracts  if applicable  and  except as noted below  payment of its expenses  summarized below under contractual obligations 
usbo currently generates cash primarily from i the sale of creation baskets and ii income earned on cash and or cash equivalents 
usbo has allocated substantially all of its net assets to trading in crude oil interests 
usbo invests in crude oil interests to the fullest extent possible without being leveraged or unable to satisfy its current or potential margin or collateral obligations with respect to its investments in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments 
a significant portion of usbo s nav is held in cash and cash equivalents that are used as margin and as collateral for its trading in crude oil interests 
the balance of the assets is held in usbo s account at the custodian and in treasuries at the futures commission merchant 
income received from usbo s money market funds and treasuries is paid to usbo 
during the year ended december  and the period ended december   usbo s expenses exceeded the income usbo earned and the cash earned from the sale of creation baskets 
during the year ended december  and the period ended december   usbo was forced to use other assets to pay expenses  which could cause a drop in usbo s nav over time 
to the extent expenses exceed income  usbo s nav will be negatively impacted 

table of contents usbo s investments in crude oil interests may be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions  regulatory considerations and other reasons 
for example  most commodity exchanges limit the fluctuations in futures contracts prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits 
during a single day  no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit 
once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit  positions in the contracts can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the specified daily limit 
such market conditions could prevent usbo from promptly liquidating its positions in futures contracts 
during the year ended december   usbo was not forced to purchase or liquidate any of its positions while daily limits were in effect  however  usbo cannot predict whether such an event may occur in the future 
prior to the initial offering of usbo  all payments with respect to usbo s expenses were paid by uscf 
usbo does not have any obligation or intention to refund such payments by uscf 
uscf is under no obligation to pay usbo s current or future expenses 
since the initial offering of units  usbo has been responsible for expenses relating to i management fees  ii brokerage fees and commissions  iii ongoing registration expenses in connection with offers and sales of its units subsequent to the initial offering  iv other expenses  including tax reporting costs  v fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf and vi other extraordinary expenses not in the ordinary course of business  while uscf has been responsible for expenses relating to the fees of usbo s marketing agent  administrator and custodian and registration expenses relating to the initial offering of units 
if uscf and usbo are unsuccessful in raising sufficient funds to cover these respective expenses or in locating any other source of funding  usbo will terminate and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
market risk trading in futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  such as forwards  involves usbo entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell oil at a specified date in the future 
the aggregate market value of the contracts will significantly exceed usbo s future cash requirements since usbo intends to close out its open positions prior to settlement 
as a result  usbo is generally only subject to the risk of loss arising from the change in value of the contracts 
usbo considers the fair value of its derivative instruments to be the unrealized gain or loss on the contracts 
the market risk associated with usbo s commitments to purchase oil is limited to the aggregate market value of the contracts held 
however  should usbo enter into a contractual commitment to sell oil  it would be required to make delivery of the oil at the contract price  repurchase the contract at prevailing prices or settle in cash 
since there are no limits on the future price of oil  the market risk to usbo could be unlimited 
usbo s exposure to market risk depends on a number of factors  including the markets for oil  the volatility of interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the liquidity of the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments markets and the relationships among the contracts held by usbo 
drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to the loss of all or substantially all of an investor s capital 
credit risk when usbo enters into futures contracts and other crude oil related investments  it is exposed to the credit risk that the counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations 
the counterparty for the futures contracts traded on the ice futures and on most other futures exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with the particular exchange 
in general  in addition to margin required to be posted by the clearinghouse in connection with cleared trades  clearinghouses are backed by their members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance of one of their members and  therefore  this additional member support should significantly reduce credit risk 
some foreign exchanges are not backed by their clearinghouse members but may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions 
there can be no assurance that any counterparty  clearinghouse  or their members or their financial backers will satisfy their obligations to usbo in such circumstances 

table of contents uscf attempts to manage the credit risk of usbo by following various trading limitations and policies 
in particular  usbo generally posts margin and or holds liquid assets that are approximately equal to the market value of its obligations to counterparties under the futures contracts and other crude oil related investments it holds 
uscf has implemented procedures that include  but are not limited to  executing and clearing trades only with creditworthy parties and or requiring the posting of collateral or margin by such parties for the benefit of usbo to limit its credit exposure 
ubs securities  usbo s commodity broker  or any other broker that may be retained by usbo in the future  when acting as usbo s futures commission merchant in accepting orders to purchase or sell futures contracts on united states exchanges  is required by cftc regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to usbo  all assets of usbo relating to domestic futures contracts trading 
these futures commission merchants are not allowed to commingle usbo s assets with their other assets 
in addition  the cftc requires commodity brokers to hold in a secure account usbo s assets related to foreign futures contracts trading 
during the year ended december   the only foreign exchange on which usbo made investments was the ice futures  which is a london based futures exchange 
those crude oil contracts are denominated in us dollars 
if  in the future  usbo purchases over the counter contracts  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k for a discussion of over the counter contracts 
as of december   usbo held cash deposits and investments in treasuries and money market funds in the amount of  this amount may be subject to loss should the custodian cease operations 
off balance sheet financing as of december   usbo had no loan guarantee  credit support or other off balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business  which may include indemnification provisions relating to certain risks that service providers undertake in performing services  which are in the best interests of usbo 
while usbo s exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated  they are not expected to have a material impact on usbo s financial position 
european sovereign debt usbo had no direct exposure to european sovereign debt as of december  and has no direct exposure to european sovereign debt as of the filing of this annual report on form k 
redemption basket obligation in order to meet its investment objective and pay its contractual obligations described below  usbo requires liquidity to redeem units  which redemptions must be in blocks of  units as of february   called redemption baskets 
prior to february   the size of the redemption basket was  units 
usbo has to date satisfied this obligation by paying from the cash or cash equivalents it holds or through the sale of its treasuries in an amount proportionate to the number of units being redeemed 
contractual obligations usbo s primary contractual obligations are with uscf 
in return for its services  uscf is entitled to a management fee calculated monthly as a fixed percentage of usbo s nav  currently of nav on its daily average net assets 
uscf agreed to pay the start up costs associated with the formation of usbo  primarily its legal  accounting and other costs in connection with uscf s registration with the cftc as a cpo and the registration and listing of usbo and its units with the sec  finra and nyse arca formerly  amex  respectively 
however  since usbo s initial offering of units  offering costs incurred in connection with registering and listing additional units of usbo have been directly borne on an ongoing basis by usbo  and not by uscf 
uscf pays the fees of the marketing agent and the fees of the custodian and transfer agent  bbh co  as well as bbh co 
s fees for performing administrative services  including those in connection with the preparation of usbo s financial statements and its sec  nfa and cftc reports 
usbo also pays the fees and expenses associated with its tax accounting and reporting requirements 
uscf  though under no obligation to do so  agreed to pay certain expenses normally borne by usbo to the extent that such expenses exceed basis points of usbo s nav  on an annualized basis  through at least june  uscf has no obligation to continue such payments into subsequent periods 

table of contents in addition to uscf s management fee  usbo pays its brokerage fees including fees to a futures commission merchant  over the counter dealer spreads  and  subsequent to the initial offering  registration and other fees paid to the sec  finra  or other regulatory agencies in connection with the offer and sale of units  as well as legal  printing  accounting and other expenses associated therewith  and extraordinary expenses 
the latter are expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of usbo s business  including expenses relating to the indemnification of any person against liabilities and obligations to the extent permitted by law and under the lp agreement  the bringing or defending of actions in law or in equity or otherwise conducting litigation and incurring legal expenses and the settlement of claims and litigation 
commission payments to a futures commission merchant are on a contract by contract  or round turn  basis 
usbo also pays a portion of the fees and expenses of the independent directors of uscf 
see note to the notes to financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the parties cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods  as usbo s navs and trading levels to meet its investment objective will not be known until a future date 
these agreements are effective for a specific term agreed upon by the parties with an option to renew  or  in some cases  are in effect for the duration of usbo s existence 
either party may terminate these agreements earlier for certain reasons described in the agreements 
as of december   usbo s portfolio consisted of brent crude oil futures co contracts traded on the ice futures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk over the counter derivatives including spreads and straddles in the future  usbo may purchase over the counter contracts otc contracts 
unlike most exchange traded futures contracts or exchange traded options on such futures  each party to an otc contract bears the credit risk that the other party may not be able to perform its obligations under its contract 
to reduce the credit risk that arises in connection with such contracts  usbo will generally enter into an agreement with each counterparty based on the master agreement published by the international swaps and derivatives association  inc that provides for the netting of its overall exposure to its counterparty 
uscf assesses or reviews  as appropriate  the creditworthiness of each potential or existing counterparty to an otc contract pursuant to guidelines approved by uscf s board 
furthermore  uscf on behalf of usbo only enters into otc contracts with counterparties who are  or are affiliates of  a banks regulated by a united states federal bank regulator  b broker dealers regulated by the sec  c insurance companies domiciled in the united states  or d producers  users or traders of energy  whether or not regulated by the cftc 
any entity acting as a counterparty shall be regulated in either the united states or the united kingdom unless otherwise approved by the board after consultation with its legal counsel 
existing counterparties are also reviewed periodically by uscf 
usbo will also require that the counterparty be highly rated and or provide collateral or other credit support 
even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk  sudden changes in the value of otc transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party s exposure on the transaction in such situations 
in general  valuing otc derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities or cleared swaps because the price and terms on which such otc derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated  and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources 
in addition  while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating otc contracts  they typically are not contractually obligated to do so  particularly if they are not a party to the transaction 
as a result  it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding otc derivatives transaction 

table of contents during the year ended december   usbo did not employ any hedging methods such as those described above since all of its investments were made over an exchange 
therefore  during such period  usbo was not exposed to counterparty risk 
usbo anticipates that the use of other crude oil related investments together with its investments in futures contracts will produce price and total return results that closely track the investment goals of usbo 
however  there can be no assurance of this 
otc contracts may result in higher transaction related expenses than the brokerage commissions paid in connection with the purchase of futures contracts  which may impact usbo s ability to successfully track the benchmark futures contract
