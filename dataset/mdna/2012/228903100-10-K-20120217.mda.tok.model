item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated in in florida  preserves and distributes human tissues for transplantation and develops  manufactures  and commercializes medical devices for cardiac and vascular applications 
the cardiac and vascular human tissues distributed by cryolife include the cryovalve sg pulmonary heart valve cryovalve sgpv and the cryopatch sg pulmonary cardiac patch tissue cryopatch sg  both processed using cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology 
cryolife s surgical sealants and hemostats include bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue  biofoam surgical matrix biofoam  and perclot  an absorbable powdered hemostat  which the company distributes for starch medical  inc smi in the european community and other select international markets 
cryolife s subsidiary cardiogenesis corporation cardiogenesis  specializes in the treatment of coronary artery disease using a laser console system and single use  fiber optic handpieces to treat patients with severe angina 
for the year ended december  cryolife had record annual revenues of million 
during cryolife reported its highest revenues ever for a first  second  and third quarter 
the company s fourth quarter was both the highest fourth quarter revenue performance ever for cryolife and the highest quarterly revenues in any quarter in company history of million 
the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in may added to the revenue growth as revenues from revascularization technologies increased quarter over quarter in the third and fourth quarters as the company integrated cardiogenesis operations 
the company s cash position was strong as the company generated million in cash flows from operations during the company experienced increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses during due to increased spending on business development activities and additional costs related to the acquisition of cardiogenesis 
see the results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during recent events revised credit agreement with ge capital on october  cryolife amended and restated its march  credit agreement with ge capital the ge credit agreement which provides revolving credit for working capital  acquisitions  and other corporate purposes 
the amendment increased the borrowing capacity under the ge credit agreement from million to million including a letter of credit subfacility and extended the expiration from october  to october  as of december  the outstanding balance under the ge credit agreement was zero  and million was available for borrowing 
stock repurchase program on november  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the company s purchase of million of its common stock through december   which included approximately million remaining from the june  million stock repurchase program and an additional million 
the purchase of shares may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  on such terms as management deems appropriate  and will be dependent upon various factors  including price  regulatory requirements  and other market conditions 
critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold 
therefore  the tissues the company preserves and processes are not held as inventory 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations otpos  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
although the company cannot own human tissue  the preservation process is a manufacturing process that is accounted for using the same principles as inventory costing 
preservation costs consist primarily of direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from departments that support processing and preservation activities and facility allocations 
preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to an implanting facility 
the allocation of fixed production overhead costs is based on actual production levels  to the extent that they are within the range of the facility s normal capacity 
cost of preservation services also includes  as incurred  idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  extra freight  and rehandling costs 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the costs included in deferred preservation costs contain several estimates due to the timing differences between the occurrence of the cost and receipt of final bills for services 
costs that contain estimates include tissue procurement fees  which are estimated based on the company s contracts with independent otpos  and freight in charges  which are estimated based on the company s prior experiences with these charges 
these costs are adjusted for differences between estimated and actual fees when invoices for these services are received 
management believes that its estimates approximate the actual costs of these services  but estimates could differ from actual costs 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among the different tissues processed during the period based on specific cost drivers such as the number of donors and the number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date  a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management determines this estimate of quarantine yields based on its experience in prior periods and reevaluates this estimate periodically 
due to the nature of this estimate and the length of the processing times experienced by the company  actual yields could differ from the company s estimates 
a significant change in quarantine yields could result in an adjustment to or write down of deferred preservation costs and  therefore  materially affect the amount of deferred preservation costs on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the cost of preservation services on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as a part of the normal course of business  the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value or if there is any impairment to the costs for tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of its packaging 
cryolife records a charge to cost of preservation services to write down the amount of deferred preservation costs not deemed to be recoverable 
typically  lower of cost or market value write downs are primarily due to excess tissue processing costs incurred that exceed the estimated market value of the tissue services  based on then recent average service fees 
impairment write downs are recorded based on the book value of the impaired tissues 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels if the market value of tissue services increase or when tissues are shipped or become available for shipment 
the company recorded write downs to its deferred preservation costs totaling   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
as of december  deferred preservation costs consisted of million for heart valves  million for cardiac patch tissues  and million for vascular tissues 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
estimates and judgments used in the determination of the need for a valuation allowance and in calculating the amount of a needed valuation allowance include  but are not limited to  the following projected future operating results  anticipated future state tax apportionment  timing and amounts of anticipated future taxable income  timing of the anticipated reversal of book tax temporary differences  evaluation of statutory limits regarding usage of certain tax assets  and evaluation of the statutory periods over which certain tax assets can be utilized 
significant changes in the factors above  or other factors  could materially adversely impact the company s ability to use its deferred tax assets 
such changes could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the company will continue to assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its prior determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
the company believes that the realizability of its deferred tax assets will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of its subsidiary cardiogenesis  as mandated by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  as a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in the second quarter of the deferred tax assets recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets do not include amounts that it expects will not be realizable due to this change in control 
the company s tax years through generally remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
however  certain returns from years prior to  in which net operating losses and tax credits have arisen  are still open for examination by the tax authorities 
liability claims in the normal course of business the company is made aware of adverse events involving its tissues and products 
any adverse event could ultimately give rise to a lawsuit against the company 
in addition  tissue processing and product liability claims may be asserted against the company in the future based on events it is not aware of at the present time 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to tissue processing and product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
any punitive damage components of claims are uninsured 
the company estimates its liability for and any related recoverable under the company s insurance policies as of each balance sheet date 
the company uses a frequency severity approach to estimate its unreported tissue processing and product liability claims  whereby  projected losses are calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims are determined based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim is calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the company uses a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of reported claims would be based on the company s past experience for policy years through the present with consideration given to the frequency spike experienced in policy year the average cost per claim would be consistent with the company s historical experience  adjusted to current cost levels  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on these product lines  the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary  and the number of cardiogenesis claims per million dollars of cardiogenesis revenue would be lower than non cardiogenesis claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on cardiogenesis claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that the assumptions it uses to determine its unreported loss liability provide a reasonable basis for its calculation 
however  the accuracy of the estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
the company accrues its estimate of unreported tissue processing and product liability claims as components of accrued expenses and other long term liabilities and records the related recoverable insurance amounts as a component of receivables and other long term assets 
the amounts recorded represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported claims related to services performed and products sold prior to the balance sheet date 
the company expenses the costs of legal services  including legal services related to tissue processing and product liability claims  as they are incurred 
valuation of acquired assets or businesses as part of its corporate strategy  the company is seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies 
the company evaluates and accounts for acquired patents  licenses  distribution rights  and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group  or as a business combination  as appropriate 
the determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires significant judgment based on the weight of available evidence 
for the purchase of an asset group  the company allocates the cost of the asset group  including transaction costs  to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values 
in process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition 
the company accounts for business combinations by allocating the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred 
in process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued 
the company engages external advisors to assist it in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations  using cost  market  or income valuation methodologies  as appropriate  including the excess earnings  the discounted cash flow  or the relief from royalty methods 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgments and estimates  including  but not limited to timing of product life cycles  estimates of future revenues  estimates of profitability for new or acquired products  cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes  estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  estimates of the success of competitive products  and discount rates 
management  in consultation with its advisor s  makes these estimates based on its prior experiences and industry knowledge 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
a significant change in management s estimates used to value acquired asset groups could result in future write downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by the company and  therefore  could materially impact the company s financial position and profitability 
if the value of the liabilities assumed by the company  including contingent liabilities  is determined to be significantly different from the amounts previously recorded in purchase accounting  the company may need to record additional expenses or write downs in future periods  which could materially impact the company s financial position and profitability 
new accounting pronouncements in may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss which clarifies some existing concepts and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
asu will be effective for the company beginning january   and the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on its financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in june the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december the fasb issued asu  which deferred the guidance on whether to require entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
asu reinstated the requirements for the presentation of reclassifications that were in place prior to the issuance of asu and did not change the effective date for asu asu and asu will be effective for the company beginning january   and the company does not expect the adoption of asu and asu to have a material effect on its financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in september the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment which gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
asu will be effective for the company beginning january   and the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on its financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the three months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase revascularization technologies total products other total revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase revascularization technologies other medical devices total products other total revenues increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
preservation services revenues from preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in vascular preservation services revenues 
preservation services revenues for the twelve months ended december  were comparable to revenues for the twelve months ended december  see further discussion of cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services consisting of revenues from the distribution of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the aggregate impact of a decrease in volume and tissue mix  which decreased revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from cardiac preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the aggregate impact of a decrease in volume and tissue mix  which decreased revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the reduction in revenues from the decrease in volume and cardiac tissue mix for both the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in volume of cardiac valve shipments 
for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the volume of lower fee cardiac patch tissues 
the company believes that the decrease in unit shipments of cardiac valves was primarily due to increasing pressure from lower cost competitive products and to continuing cost containment practices at certain hospitals 
the company believes that these pressures will persist  but that they will be largely offset in by the activities of its expanded sales staff which increased as a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis 
revenues from synergraft processed tissues  including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
vascular preservation services revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in vascular tissue volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins  resulting from the strong demand for these tissues in domestic markets  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
products revenues from products increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to revenues from revascularization technologies as a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in the second quarter of and  to a lesser extent  due to an increase in perclot and bioglue revenues  partially offset by a decrease in hemostase revenues 
a detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for bioglue and biofoam  perclot and hemostase  and revascularization technologies is presented below 
bioglue and biofoam revenues from the sale of surgical sealants  consisting of bioglue and biofoam  increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of surgical sealants increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which increased revenues by the increase in sales volume of surgical sealants for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in shipments of bioglue in certain international markets  primarily japan 
the company began shipping bioglue to japan in late april  following the japanese approval of bioglue for use in the repair of aortic dissections 
revenues from shipments to japan for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by volume decreases in the company s more mature domestic and european markets 
management believes that the decrease in bioglue shipments in its domestic markets is a result of various factors  including the us market introduction of sealant products with approved indications for use in clinical applications in which bioglue has been used off label previously  poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  the resulting attempts by hospitals to control costs by reducing spending on consumable items such as bioglue  and the efforts of some large competitors in imposing and enforcing contract purchasing requirements for competing non cryolife products 
management believes that the decline in european volume may be due to general economic conditions in europe  specifically in the euro zone countries 
the company s sales of surgical sealants through its direct sales force to united kingdom hospitals are denominated in british pounds  and its sales to german hospitals and certain distributors are denominated in euros and are therefore subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 
if the exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro or british pound decline materially in compared to the corresponding periods in  this would have a material adverse impact on the company s revenues denominated in these currencies 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
biofoam sales accounted for less than of surgical sealant sales for the three and twelve months ended december  biofoam is currently approved for sale in certain international markets 
bioglue is a mature product that has experienced increasing competitive pressures 
management believes that bioglue sales volume in domestic markets will continue to be impacted by the factors discussed above 
management believes that surgical sealant sales into europe may continue to be effected by poor economic conditions in europe and that these conditions may worsen in management believes that international bioglue sales will be positively impacted in the first half of by sales to japan  as there are no sales to japan in the corresponding period in perclot and hemostase revenues from the sale of hemostats  consisting of perclot and hemostase  decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  revenues from the sale of hemostats decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the revenue decreases in the three and twelve months ended december  were primarily due to a decrease in hemostat sales volume in domestic markets  as discussed further below 
for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volume in international markets in the year to date period 
international hemostat revenues decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in certain international markets  particularly in canada and south america due to large orders filled in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of a disruption in the availability of hemostats to the company s distributors in these countries beginning in early this disruption was due to the company s planned march discontinuance of hemostase sales subsequent to the termination of its exclusive distribution agreement eda for this product  discussed further below 
international hemostat revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in international sales of perclot in the periods over the international sales of hemostase in the corresponding periods 
management believes that international perclot revenues have been favorably impacted by the company s ability to market perclot for all surgical specialties  expanding the direct european sales force into austria  and perclot s product performance when compared to other hemostatic agents 
the decrease in domestic sales volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to the company s planned discontinuation of sales of hemostase in late march  as a result of medafor s termination of its eda with the company 
the company recognized no domestic hemostat sales in the second  third  or fourth quarters of  subsequent to the discontinuance of hemostase sales  as perclot is not yet approved for commercial distribution in domestic markets 
the company anticipates this loss of domestic hemostat sales to result in a significant decrease in total hemostat sales for the first quarter of when compared to the corresponding period 
the company will not be able to sell perclot in the us in future years unless and until us food and drug administration fda approval is granted 
on march  cryolife filed an investigational device exemption ide with the fda seeking approval to begin clinical trials for the purpose of obtaining premarket approval to distribute perclot in the us on april  the fda disapproved cryolife s ide filing 
cryolife anticipates refiling its ide for perclot in early revascularization technologies revenues from revascularization technologies for the three and twelve months ended december  were a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in may revascularization technologies includes revenues related to the sale of laser consoles  handpieces  and related products 
revascularization technologies revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of handpiece sales and  to a lesser extent  laser console sales 
revenues from the sale of laser consoles accounted for and of total revascularization technologies revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
other revenues other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  and included revenues related to funding allocated from us congress defense appropriations conference reports in through  collectively the dod grants 
as of december  cryolife has been awarded million and has received a total of million for the development of protein hydrogel technology  which the company is currently developing for use in organ sealing 
at december  cryolife had million included in deferred income on the company s consolidated balance sheet from the dod grants  of which million remains in unspent cash advances recorded as cash and cash equivalents 
cost of preservation services and products cost of preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of preservation services cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues cost of preservation services increased for the three months and decreased for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the respective periods in cost of preservation services includes costs for cardiac and vascular tissue preservation services 
the increase in cost of preservation services for the three months ended december  is primarily due to  in unusual processing expenses due to certain supplies of processing solutions used in our processing of tissues that did not meet our quality requirements  partially offset by cost decreases discussed below 
the decrease in cost of preservation services in the twelve months ended december  and the decrease in cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues in the three and twelve months ended december  were primarily due to a decrease in the per unit cost of processing tissues 
the decrease in the per unit cost of processing tissues in was largely a result of increased processing and packaging throughput  as fixed costs were allocated to a greater volume of processed tissues 
cost of products three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of products cost of products as a percentage of product revenues cost of products decreased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
cost of products in includes costs related to bioglue  biofoam  perclot  and revascularization technologies  and includes hemostase for the year to date period 
the company began distributing revascularization technologies products in the second quarter of through cryolife s subsidiary cardiogenesis 
cost of products in includes costs related to bioglue  biofoam  hemostase  and perclot 
the decrease in cost of products in the three months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of hemostase  partially offset by costs for revascularization technologies  which the company began selling in the second quarter of through cardiogenesis and by increased shipments of perclot  which the company began distributing in the fourth quarter of the decrease in cost of products as a percentage of product revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to decreased hemostase revenues  as hemostase had a higher cost as a percentage of revenue than bioglue and revascularization technologies revenues 
the decrease in the twelve month period was also due to the write down of hemostase inventory in the prior year period 
operating expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three months ended december  was primarily due to expenses related to the sales personnel and ongoing operations of cardiogenesis  which the company acquired in may the increase in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to expenses for business development activities and additional expenses related to the sales personnel and ongoing operations of cardiogenesis 
the company s business development activities included transaction and integration expenses related to the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis and additional business development activities 
the company s business development expenses  including outgoing personnel costs  exit activities  and legal  professional  and regulatory fees  were million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects that its general  administrative  and marketing expenses in will be significantly higher than in the comparative periods in due to legal expenses related to its ongoing litigation 
see also part i  item a  risk factors  and part i  item  legal proceedings 
the company continues to evaluate potential business development opportunities and may continue to incur costs related to these activities in  which may be material 
the company expects that it will incur additional general  administrative  and marketing expenses in the first half of related to the sales personnel and ongoing operations of cardiogenesis which were not present in the corresponding periods 
research and development expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues the company s research and development expenses include both research and development and clinical research expenses for tissues and products 
research and development spending in and was primarily focused on the company s synergraft tissues and products  including cryovalve sgpv  cryovalve sg aortic heart valves  cryopatch sg  and xenograft synergraft tissue products  perclot  and the company s bioglue family of products  including bioglue and biofoam 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development was million for the twelve months ended december  as part of the consideration paid to smi in the third quarter of  the company allocated million to an intangible asset for perclot distribution and manufacturing rights in the us and certain other countries which do not have current regulatory approvals 
this million was considered in process research and development as it was dependent upon regulatory approvals which have not yet been obtained 
therefore  cryolife expensed the million as in process research and development upon acquisition 
other income and expenses interest expense was  for the three months and  for the twelve months ended december   and  for the three months and  for the twelve months ended december  interest expense for all periods presented included interest incurred related to the company s debt  capital leases  and interest related to uncertain tax positions 
interest income was  for the three months and  for the twelve months ended december   and  for the three months and  for the twelve months ended december  interest income for all periods presented was for interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and restricted securities 
the gain on valuation of derivative was million for the twelve months ended december  the gain on valuation of derivative was due to the decrease in the value of embedded derivatives related to medafor common stock previously purchased by the company 
the other than temporary investment impairment was million for the twelve months ended december  this was due to the impairment in the value of the company s investment in medafor common stock during the third quarter of earnings three months ended december  twelve months ended december  income before income taxes income tax expense net income diluted income per common share income before income taxes decreased for the three months and increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
income before income taxes for the three and twelve months ended december  was negatively impacted by increases in general  administrative  and marketing costs  including costs related to the acquisition of cardiogenesis  other business development costs  and legal costs 
income before income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was negatively impacted primarily by acquired in process research and development expense  the other than temporary investment impairment  and the write down of hemostase inventory  as discussed above 
these effects were partially offset by the gain on valuation of derivative for the twelve months ended december  the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for the three months and for the twelve months ended december   as compared for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  the company s effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was impacted by the discrete and favorable effect of deductions taken on the company s federal tax returns  which were filed in the third quarter of this favorable effect was largely offset by the unfavorable tax treatment  recognized in the second quarter of  of certain acquisition related expenses  which the company incurred related to its acquisition of cardiogenesis 
net income and diluted income per common share for the three and twelve months ended december  changed compared to the corresponding periods in due to the changes in income before income taxes  adjusted by the effect of income tax expense  as discussed above 
diluted income per common share could be impacted in future periods unfavorably by the issuance of additional shares of common stock and favorably by the company s repurchase of its common stock 
stock repurchases are impacted by many factors  including stock price  available funds  and competing demands for such funds  and as a result  may be suspended or discontinued at any time

a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
preservation services revenues from preservation services increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac preservation service revenues 
the increase for the twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in both cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues 
see further discussion of cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services consisting of revenues from the distribution of heart valves  cardiac patch tissues  and minimally processed tissues that are distributed to a third party tissue processor increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to the impact of a increase in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues and favorable tissue mix 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the aggregate impact of favorable tissue mix and a increase in shipments of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues 
for the three and twelve months ended december   shipments of cryovalve sgpv  cryopatch sg  and aortic valves increased  partially offset by a decrease in traditionally processed cardiac patch tissues and pulmonary valves 
the favorable tissue mix in the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the favorable impact of synergraft tissues including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  which command a premium fee over standard processed tissues 
in both the three and twelve months ended december   the decrease in revenues from traditionally processed pulmonary valves was more than offset by an increase in revenues related to the cryovalve sgpv  as hospitals continue to transition to the synergraft processed product  particularly after the company received fda clearance to extend the shelf life of the cryovalve sgpv to five years in the second quarter of in the three and twelve months ended december  the decrease in revenues from traditionally processed cardiac patch tissues was not fully offset by increases in revenues from the cryopatch sg 
the company believes that these revenues were unfavorably impacted by increasing competitive pressures and by a reduced supply of certain patch tissues available for shipment during the period as the company works to achieve an optimal balance among its offered tissues 
revenues from synergraft processed tissues  including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
vascular preservation services revenues from vascular preservation services decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which decreased revenues by  largely offset by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by and an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the decrease in vascular volume for the three months ended december  was primarily due to decreases in shipments of femoral veins and arteries 
cryolife believes that vascular revenues in the fourth quarter of were lower due to increasing pressure from lower cost competitive products  which may continue into the increase in vascular volume for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins  resulting from the strong demand for these tissues in domestic markets  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
the increase in average service fees for the three and twelve months ended december  was due in part to list fee increases on certain vascular preservation services  fee differences due to vascular tissue characteristics  and due to the negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
products revenues from products increased for both the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to an increase in hemostase revenues and  to a lesser extent  perclot revenues 
see further discussions of bioglue  biofoam  perclot  and hemostase revenues below 
bioglue and biofoam revenues from the sale of bioglue and biofoam decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which decreased revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of bioglue and biofoam decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the revenues were impacted by a decrease in the volume of milliliters sold  which decreased revenues by and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which decreased revenues by  largely offset by an increase in average selling prices  which increased revenues by 
the decrease in sales volume for bioglue and biofoam for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in shipments of bioglue in domestic markets  particularly in the northeast region of the us management believes that the decrease in domestic bioglue shipments is a result of various factors  including the us market introduction of sealant products with approved indications for use in clinical applications in which bioglue has been used previously  poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  the resulting attempts by hospitals to control costs by reducing spending on consumable items such as bioglue  and the efforts of some large competitors in imposing and enforcing contract purchasing requirements for competing non cryolife products 
the impact of foreign exchange rates for the three months ended december  was due to changes in the exchange rates in the three and twelve months ended december  as compared to the respective periods in between the us dollar and the euro and  to a lesser extent  between the us dollar and the british pound 
the company s sales of bioglue and biofoam to german hospitals  austrian hospitals  and certain distributors are denominated in euros  and its sales through its direct sales force to united kingdom hospitals are denominated in british pounds 
the increase in average selling prices for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to list price increases on certain bioglue products that went into effect during and and the negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
sales of bioglue and biofoam for the three and twelve months ended december  included international sales of biofoam following receipt of the ce mark approval during the third quarter of biofoam sales accounted for less than of total bioglue and biofoam sales for the three and twelve months ended december  and domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue and biofoam revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total bioglue and biofoam revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  perclot and hemostase revenues from the sale of perclot and hemostase increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of grams sold  which increased revenues by  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices  which decreased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of perclot and hemostase increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of grams sold  which increased revenues by 
the increase in sales volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in shipments of hemostase in domestic markets and to a lesser extent shipments of perclot and hemostase in international markets 
cryolife began commercial distribution of perclot in international markets in the fourth quarter of management believes that the company lost additional sales of hemostase during the third and fourth quarters of due to uncertainty in the market as to whether the company had authority to market hemostase and as to whether it would be able to continue to supply the product in the future 
management believes that third and fourth quarter hemostase sales were also adversely impacted by continued sales by medafor of medafor s product into the company s exclusive territory in violation of the private label exclusive distribution agreement between the parties 
the decrease in average selling prices for the three months ended december  was primarily due to discounting of hemostase inventory in an attempt to sell off the company s remaining inventory balances prior to the company s planned cessation of hemostase sales in late march  as discussed further below 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total perclot and hemostase revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and of total hemostase revenues for both the three and twelve months ended december  other revenues other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  and included revenues related to funding allocated from us congress defense appropriations conference reports in through  collectively the dod grants 
as of december  cryolife had been awarded and had received a total of million for the development of protein hydrogel technology  which the company is currently developing for use in organ sealing 
at december  cryolife had million of deferred income on the company s consolidated balance sheet from the dod grants  of which million remains in unspent cash advances recorded as cash and cash equivalents

cost of preservation services and products cost of preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of preservation services cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues cost of preservation services increased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the respective periods in cost of preservation services in the three months ended december  was primarily impacted by an increase in the per unit cost of processing tissues and due to an increase is cardiac tissues shipped  partially offset by a decrease in vascular tissues shipped  as discussed above 
the increase in cost of preservation services in the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the per unit cost of processing tissues  and to a lesser extent due to an increase in cardiac and vascular tissues shipped  as discussed above 
the increase in cost of preservation services as a percentage of preservation services revenues for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the increase in the per unit cost of processing tissues 
the increase in the per unit cost of processing tissues in was largely a result of decreased processing and packaging throughput due to changes implemented in the second half of cost of products three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of products cost of products as a percentage of product revenues cost of products increased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the respective periods in the increase in cost of products for the three months ended december  was primarily due to the increase in shipments of perclot and hemostase  as discussed above 
the increase in cost of products for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a million write down of hemostase inventory in the third quarter of and an increase in shipments of perclot and hemostase  as discussed above 
to a lesser extent the increase in the twelve months ended december  was due to a slight increase in the per unit cost of manufacturing bioglue 
the write down of hemostase inventory was based on the company s review of its inventory balances after medafor s september  termination of the eda 
based on its review of the eda  the company determined that the carrying value of the hemostase inventory was impaired and increased its cost of products by million to write down hemostase inventory in the third quarter of the company continued to sell hemostase through late march see also revenues above  part i  item a  risk factors  and part i  item  legal proceedings 
the amount of this write down reflects management s estimate based on information currently available 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of its hemostase inventory as more information becomes available and may record additional write downs if it becomes clear that additional impairments have occurred 
the write down creates a new cost basis which cannot be written back up if the inventory becomes saleable 
the increase in cost of products as a percentage of product revenues for the three months ended december  was primarily due to increasing sales volume of perclot and hemostase  which have a lower profit margin than bioglue 
the increase in cost of products as a percentage of product revenues for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a million write down of hemostase inventory and increasing revenues from perclot and hemostase  which have a lower profit margin than bioglue  and to a lesser extent a slight increase in the per unit cost of manufacturing bioglue 
operating expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues general  administrative  and marketing expenses decreased and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  the decrease in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in marketing expenses  including personnel costs and spending on marketing materials  partially offset by an increase in spending on legal and professional fees and marketing expenses for the ross summit  which were incurred in the fourth quarter of  while comparable marketing expenses for the ross summit were incurred in the third quarter of expenses in the three months ended december  included approximately  in costs associated with litigation with medafor and  in business development costs 
expenses in the twelve months ended december  included  in previously capitalized legal fees associated with bioglue patent litigation in germany  approximately million in costs associated with litigation with medafor  and approximately million in business development costs 
the company s business development costs in were associated with the company s proposal to acquire medafor  the license of technology and purchase of assets from smi  and other business development activities 
the company s general  administrative  and marketing expenses included  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  related to the grant of stock options  restricted stock awards  and restricted stock units 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses for included  in costs related to a reduction in workforce implemented during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues research and development spending in and was primarily focused on the company s bioglue family of products  including bioglue and biofoam  and synergraft tissues and products  including cryovalve sgpv  cryovalve sg aortic heart valves  cryopatch sg  and xenograft synergraft tissue products  including propatch 
research and development spending in the three months ended december  also included spending on perclot 
acquired in process research and development on september  cryolife entered into a worldwide distribution agreement and a license and manufacturing agreement with smi for perclot 
as part of the consideration paid to smi in the third quarter of  the company allocated million to an intangible asset for perclot distribution and manufacturing rights in the us and certain other countries which do not have current regulatory approvals 
this million is considered in process research and development as it is dependent upon regulatory approvals which have not yet been obtained 
therefore  cryolife expensed the million as in process research and development upon acquisition 
other income and expenses interest expense was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for the three and twelve months ended december  and included interest incurred related to the company s debt and interest related to uncertain tax positions 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to a reversal of interest expense related to the company s uncertain tax positions in the fourth quarter of interest income was  and  for the three months ended december  and  respectively  and  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
interest income for the three and twelve months ended december  and was primarily due to interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and restricted securities 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to a decline in interest rates paid on the company s cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by an increase in the balance in these accounts 
other than temporary investment impairment was million for the twelve months ended december   due to the impairment of the company s investment in medafor common stock during the third quarter of the company determined that no additional impairment of the value of medafor common stock had occurred in the fourth quarter of the carrying value of the company s investment in medafor common stock after this write down was million or per share as of september  and december  the company will continue to evaluate the carrying value of this investment as appropriate 
if the company subsequently determines that the value of its medafor common stock has been impaired further or if the company decides to sell its medafor common stock for less than the carrying value  the resulting impairment charge or realized loss on sale of the investment in medafor could be material 
the gain on valuation of derivative was zero and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
during the fourth quarter of and during  the company made several purchases of medafor common stock that contained purchase price make whole provisions  which the company accounted for as embedded derivatives 
the decrease in the value of the liability for these embedded derivatives  largely resulting from a significant decrease in the likelihood of a triggering event occurring  resulted in a non cash gain for the twelve months ended december  cryolife believes that the likelihood of a triggering event occurring was substantially reduced in the first quarter of and was zero as of december  and thereafter 
earnings three months ended december  twelve months ended december  income before income taxes income tax expense net income diluted income per common share income before income taxes decreased for the three months and the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december  income before income taxes for the three and twelve months ended december  was negatively impacted primarily by acquired in process research and development expense  the other than temporary investment impairment  and the write down of hemostase inventory  as discussed above 
these effects were partially offset by the gain on valuation of derivative for the twelve months ended december  the company s effective income tax rate was and for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  as compared to and for the three and twelve months ended december  the company s income tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was negatively impacted by the write downs and expenses discussed above  which reduced income before income taxes 
net income and diluted income per common share for the three and twelve months ended december  decreased compared to the corresponding periods in due to the decrease in income before income taxes and income taxes as discussed above 
seasonality the company s demand for its cardiac preservation services has traditionally been seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the third quarter 
management believes this trend for cardiac preservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months for school aged patients 
management believes that this trend is lessening in recent years as the company is distributing a higher percentage of its tissues to adult populations 
the company believes the demand for its vascular preservation services is seasonal  with lowest demand generally occurring in the fourth quarter  although this trend was not apparent in management will continue to evaluate this trend in future periods to determine if its vascular business continues to be seasonal 
the company believes the demand for bioglue is seasonal  with a decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter 
management believes that this trend for bioglue may be due to the summer holiday season in europe and fewer surgeries being performed on adult patients in the summer months in the us the company is uncertain whether the demand for perclot will be seasonal 
as perclot is in a growth phase generally associated with a recently introduced product that has not fully penetrated the marketplace  the nature of any seasonal trends in perclot sales may be obscured  although management believes that perclot may exhibit a similar trend as bioglue  with a decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter 
the company is uncertain whether the demand for revascularization technologies will be seasonal  as the company only recently acquired this product line in may and the historical data does not indicate a significant trend 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital at december  net working capital current assets of million less current liabilities of million was million  with a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to  compared to net working capital of million and a current ratio of to at december  overall liquidity and capital resources the company s largest cash requirement for the twelve months ended december  was the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of cardiogenesis and related transaction costs

for the year ended december  the company purchased approximately  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase of shares may be made from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  on such terms as management deems appropriate  and will be dependent upon various factors  including price  regulatory requirements  and other market conditions 
the company expects to have sufficient working capital and cash flow from operations to fund its common stock repurchases 
the company s cash equivalents include advance funding received under the dod grants for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology 
as of december  million of the company s cash equivalents were related to these dod grants  which must be used for the specified purposes 
as of december  less than of the company s cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign jurisdictions 
the company has agreed to provide funding of up to million in debt financing to valvexchange through a revolving credit facility 
the company cannot currently anticipate if or when valvexchange may draw funding from this credit facility 
the company believes that its anticipated cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents will enable the company to meet its current operational liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
the company s future cash requirements may include cash to fund clinical trials  including the perclot and cardiogenesis clinical trials  to fund other business development activities  to purchase license agreements  for general working capital needs  to fund the medafor litigation and other litigation  to fund the valvexchange revolving credit facility  to repurchase the company s common stock  and for other corporate purposes 
these items may have a significant impact on its cash flows during the company may seek additional borrowing capacity to fund additional business development activities or other future cash requirements  and will be required to obtain such funding to finance significant future business development activities 
the company acquired net operating loss carryforwards from its acquisition of cardiogenesis and the company has tax credit carryforwards from prior year income tax returns 
the company believes that the utilization of these tax carryforwards will reduce required cash payments for federal income taxes by approximately million for the tax year 
net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the current year cash provided was primarily due to net income generated by the company during the period and non cash expenses  partially offset by increases in working capital needs  primarily due to the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in may the company uses the indirect method to prepare its cash flow statement  and  accordingly  the operating cash flows are based on the company s net income  which is then adjusted to remove non cash items and for changes in operating assets and liabilities from the prior year end 
for the twelve months ended december  these non cash items included a favorable million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in non cash stock based compensation  and million in deferred income taxes 
the company s working capital needs  or changes in operating assets and liabilities  also affected cash from operations 
for the twelve months ended december  these changes included an unfavorable million due to the timing difference between recording receivables and the receipt of cash  an unfavorable  due to the timing differences between the recording of accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities and the actual payment of cash and an unfavorable  due to the timing difference between making cash payments and the expensing of assets  including prepaid insurance policy premiums  partially offset by a favorable million due to decreases in deferred preservation costs and inventory balances 
net cash from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the current year cash used was primarily due to the payment of million for the acquisition of cardiogenesis  net of cash acquired  the investment of million for valvexchange preferred stock  and million in capital expenditures

these minimum purchases are included through  as the company expects to receive fda approval for perclot no later than upon fda approval  the company may terminate its minimum purchase requirements  which it expects to do 
however  if the company does not terminate this provision  it will have minimum purchase obligations of million per year from through the end of the contract term in the company s purchase commitments also include obligations from agreements with suppliers and contractual payments for licensing computer software and telecommunication services 
the company s research obligations represent commitments for ongoing studies and payments to support research and development activities  which will be partially funded by the advances received under the dod grants 
the obligation for perclot contingent payments represents the contingent milestone payments that the company will pay if certain fda regulatory approvals and other commercial milestones are achieved 
the schedule excludes one contingent milestone payment of  as the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of timing of this future payment 
the company s compensation payment obligations represent estimated payments for post employment benefits for the company s chief executive officer ceo 
the timing of the ceo s post employment benefits is based on the december expiration date of the ceo s employment agreement 
payment of this benefit may be accelerated by a change in control or by the voluntary retirement of the ceo 
the schedule of contractual obligations above excludes i obligations for estimated liability claims unless they are due as a result of a pending settlement agreement or other contractual obligation and ii any estimated liability for uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties  currently estimated to be million  because the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments as no specific assessments have been made for specific litigation or by any taxing authorities
