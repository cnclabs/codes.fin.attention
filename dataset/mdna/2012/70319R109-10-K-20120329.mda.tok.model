item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction throughout management s discussion and analysis md a the term  the company  refers to the consolidated entity of pathfinder bancorp  inc pathfinder bank and pathfinder statutory trust ii are wholly owned subsidiaries of pathfinder bancorp  inc  however  pathfinder statutory trust ii is not consolidated for reporting purposes see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pathfinder commercial bank  pathfinder reit  inc and whispering oaks development corp 
are wholly owned subsidiaries of pathfinder bank 
at december   pathfinder bancorp  mhc  the company s mutual holding company parent  whose activities are not included in the consolidated financial statements or the md a  held of the company s outstanding common stock and the public held of the outstanding common stock 
the company s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and in investment securities 
specifically  the company s business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail deposit base 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of noninterest income  including income from fees  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales and redemptions of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  and noninterest expense such as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  of which these events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market rates tends to be highly cyclical 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes  pension obligations  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment and the estimation of fair values for accounting and disclosure purposes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such  could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
page 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
to the extent that current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income  including that which is considered capital  is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance of  was maintained at december   as management believes it may not generate sufficient capital gains to offset its capital loss carry forward 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due primarily to non taxable income from investment securities and bank owned life insurance 
pension and post retirement benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions of future events  including fair value of plan assets  interest rates  rate of future compensation increases and the length of time the company will have to provide those benefits 
the assumptions used by management are discussed in note to the consolidated annual financial statements 
management performs an annual evaluation of the company s goodwill for possible impairment 
based on the results of the evaluation  management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill is not impaired as of december  the evaluation approach is described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company carries all of its investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity  except for the credit related portion of debt security impairment losses and other than temporary impairment otti of equity securities  which are charged to earnings 
the company s ability to fully realize the value of its investments in various securities  including corporate debt securities  is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization 
in evaluating the debt security portfolio for other than temporary impairment losses  management considers if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or if the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
in determining whether otti has occurred for equity securities  the company considers the applicable factors described above and the length of time the equity security s fair value has been below the carrying amount 
management continually analyzes the portfolio to determine if further impairment has occurred that may be deemed as other than temporary 
further charges are possible depending on future economic conditions 
the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  the interest rate derivative  intangible assets and foreclosed real estate  as well as the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
page 
table of contents fair values for securities available for sale are obtained from an independent third party pricing service 
where available  fair values are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar benchmark securities 
management made no adjustments to the fair value quotes that were provided by the pricing source 
the fair values of foreclosed real estate and the underlying collateral value of impaired loans are typically determined based on evaluations by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
when necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions 
executive summary and results of operations earnings performance metrics for were generally less than those reported for as net income  return on assets and return on equity all decreased 
net income for was million  a  decrease from and return on assets and return on equity were and  respectively  down and from while net interest income increased in  expenses relating to the new cicero branch location  professional fees in support of the payoff of the company s participation in the cpp and its entrance into the sblf  and expenses relating to the esop and stock option programs contributed to the higher expenses 
offsets to these expense increases included gains from the sales of available for sale securities and a reduction in fdic assessment expenses 
total assets increased million to million as total deposits grew million primarily as a result of the opening of the new cicero branch location 
the increase in assets was generally apportioned between the investment securities portfolio and loans as the latter grew year over year  centered largely in the residential mortgage segment 
the company will continue to emphasize its focus in the cicero  central square  and fulton markets where it feels further market penetration opportunities exist 
additionally  we will maintain focus on expanding commercial deposit relationships with our existing lending customers as well as expanding our commercial loan growth in the greater syracuse market 
asset quality metrics were mixed in when compared with net charge offs were  a  increase due largely to one large commercial relationship  but the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans and nonperforming assets to total assets both declined 
the ratio of allowance to loan losses to period end loans increased slightly to  as management continues to re evaluate the estimable and probable losses within the loan portfolio and provide additional allowance related to growth 
the company improved its equity position in as it paid off the preferred stock related to its participation in the cpp and entered into an agreement with the treasury to participate in the sblf program 
these concurrent actions resulted in a million increase in equity 
retained earnings increased  through driven by net income and partially offset by preferred and common stock dividends  accretion of the preferred stock discount  and the sale of shares to the esop 
net interest income net interest income is the company s primary source of operating income for payment of operating expenses and providing for possible loan losses 
it is the amount by which interest earned on interest earning deposits  loans and investment securities exceeds the interest paid on deposits and borrowed money 
changes in net interest income and the net interest margin ratio result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and their respective yields and funding costs

nonaccrual loans that meet the criteria of an impaired loan are specifically evaluated for impairment based on the underlying collateral support for the loan or the present value of future cash flows  and an allowance is provided  if necessary  which is included within the allowance for loan losses 
appraisals are obtained at the time a real estate secured loan is originated 
collateral is reevaluated should the loan become days delinquent to best determine the bank s level of exposure 
when a loan enters nonaccrual status  the bank evaluates its collateral position and  if appropriate  a new appraisal is performed 
when evaluating our ability to collect from secondary sources  appraised values are adjusted to reflect the age of appraisal  the condition of the property  the current local real estate market  and cost to sell 
properties are re appraised when our evaluation of the current property condition and the local real estate market suggests values may not be accurate 
page 
table of contents the company generally places a loan on non accrual status and ceases accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more or when it is probably that the company will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments

management has identified potential problem loans totaling million as of december   compared to million in potential problem loans as of december  these loans have been internally classified as special mention or substandard  yet are not currently considered impaired or in non accrual status 
management has identified potential credit problems which may result in the borrowers not being able to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in it being included in future past due reporting 
management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio

in the normal course of business  pathfinder bank has sold residential mortgage loans and participation interests in commercial loans 
as is typical in the industry  the bank makes certain representations and warranties to the buyer 
the bank maintains a quality control program for closed loans and has never been asked to repurchase a sold loan 
therefore  management considers the risks and uncertainties associated with potential repurchase requirements to be minimal 
there are no known or alleged defects in the securitization process or in the mortgage documentation 
any future risk of exposure would be immaterial 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses and reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses represents the amount available for probable credit losses in the company s loan portfolio as estimated by management 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon a monthly evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  which includes a review of the balances and composition of the loan portfolio as well as analyzing the level of delinquencies in each segment of the loan portfolio 
the company establishes a specific allocation for all loans identified as being impaired with a balance in excess of  which are on nonaccrual or have been risk rated under the company s risk rating system as substandard  doubtful  or loss 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  less costs to sell 
the majority of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
the company uses the fair value of collateral less costs to sell to measure impairment on commercial and commercial real estate loans 
large residential real estate loans may also be included in this individual loan review 
at december  and  the company had million and million in loans  which were identified as impaired  having valuation allowances of  and million  respectively 
for all other loans and leases  the company uses the general allocation methodology that establishes an allowance to estimate the probable incurred loss for each risk rating category that reflects actual loss experience  delinquency trends  current economic conditions  and several other environmental factors

risk based capital provides the basis for which all banks are evaluated in terms of capital adequacy 
capital adequacy is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
the company s goal is to maintain a strong capital position  consistent with the risk profile of its subsidiary banks that supports growth and expansion activities while at the same time exceeding regulatory standards 
at december   the bank exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution  ie a leverage capital ratio exceeding  a tier risk based capital ratio exceeding and a total risk based capital ratio exceeding 
as a result of the dodd frank act  the company s ability to raise new capital through the use of trust preferred securities may be limited because these securities will no longer be included in tier capital 
in addition  our ability to generate or originate additional revenue producing assets may be constrained in the future in order to comply with anticipated heightened capital standards required by state and federal regulation
