additional details are provided in the liquidity and capital resources section in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition in our us retail segment  we compete with traditional and off price general merchandise retailers  apparel retailers  internet retailers  wholesale clubs  category specific retailers  drug stores  supermarkets and other forms of retail commerce in the us our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers largely determines our competitive position within the us retail industry 
in our canadian segment  we will compete with similar retail categories and will be focused on positively differentiating ourselves within the canadian retail market 
in our us credit card segment  our primary mission is to deliver financial products and services that drive sales and deepen guest relationships at target 
our financial products compete with those of other issuers for market share of sales volume 
our ability to positively differentiate the value of our financial products primarily through our rewards programs  terms  credit line management  and guest service determines our competitive position among credit card issuers

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests with a brand they trust 
meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various strategic  operational  compliance  reputational  and financial risks 
set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 

table of contents if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the retail business is highly competitive 
in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price  merchandise assortment  convenience  guest service and marketing efforts 
guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores  our in stock levels  the convenience and reliability of our multichannel guest experience and other factors also affect our ability to compete 
no single competitive factor is dominant  and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales  gross margin and expenses 
our continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of target  including our owned and exclusive brands 
we believe that one of the reasons our guests prefer to shop at target and our team members choose target as a place of employment is the reputation we have built over many years of serving our four primary constituencies guests  team members  the communities in which we operate and shareholders 
to be successful in the future  we must continue to preserve  grow and leverage the value of target s reputation 
reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities  and even isolated incidents that erode trust and confidence  particularly if they result in adverse publicity  governmental investigations or litigation  can have an adverse impact on these perceptions and lead to tangible adverse effects on our business  including consumer boycotts  loss of new store development opportunities  or team member recruiting difficulties 
in addition  we sell many products under our owned and exclusive brands  such as market pantry  up up  target home  merona and mossimo 
these brands generally carry higher margins than national brand products  and represent a growing portion of our overall sales  totaling approximately one third of sales in if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence  our sales and gross margin rate could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to successfully maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our guests  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our guests are increasingly using computers  tablets  mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online 
as part of our multichannel strategy  we offer full and mobile versions of our website target 
com and applications for mobile phones and tablets 
in addition  we use social media as a way to interact with our guests and enhance their shopping experiences 
multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors 
if we are unable to attract and retain team members or contract third parties with the specialized skills needed to support our multichannel platforms  or are unable to implement improvements to our guest facing technology in a timely manner  our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if target 
com and our other guest facing technology systems do not function as designed  we may experience a loss of guest confidence  data security breaches  lost sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases  which could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 
if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences  our sales  gross margin and profitability could suffer 
a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions in apparel  home d cor  seasonal offerings  food and other merchandise 
failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes  preferences  spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions may result in lost sales  spoilage and increased inventory markdowns  which would lead to a deterioration in our results of operations 

table of contents we are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the united states 
all of our stores are currently located within the united states  making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy 
in addition  a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california  texas  florida  minnesota and illinois  resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many ways  including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales  and reducing gross margins 
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our retail sales  these same considerations impact the success of our us credit card segment 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions can adversely affect cardholders ability to pay their balances  and we may not be able to fully anticipate and respond to changes in the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit  resulting in higher bad debt expense 
demand for consumer credit is also impacted by consumer choices regarding payment methods  and our performance could be adversely affected by consumer decisions to use third party debit cards or other forms of payment 
if we do not effectively manage our large and growing workforce  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
with approximately  team members  our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense  and our business is dependent on our ability to attract  train and retain qualified team members 
many of those team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  collective bargaining efforts  health care and other benefit costs and changing demographics 
if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members  our operations  guest service levels and support functions could suffer 
those factors  together with increasing wage and benefit costs  could adversely affect our results of operations 
as of march   none of our team members were working under collective bargaining agreements 
we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts 
if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future  it could adversely affect our labor costs and how we operate our business 
lack of availability of suitable locations in which to build new stores could slow our growth  and difficulty in executing plans for new stores  expansions and remodels could increase our costs and capital requirements 
our future growth is dependent  in part  on our ability to build new stores and expand and remodel existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment 
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores 
in addition  for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer s ability to acquire land  obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project  of which our store may be one component 
turmoil in the financial markets may make it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects 
local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may affect our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing  expanding and remodeling our stores 
a significant portion of our expected new store sites is located in fully developed markets  which is generally a more time consuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets 
interruptions in our supply chain or increased commodity prices and supply chain costs could adversely affect our results 
we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner 
if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments  whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons  we could experience merchandise out of stocks that could lead to lost sales 
in addition  a large portion of our merchandise is sourced  directly or 
table of contents indirectly  from outside the united states  with china as our single largest source 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  the outbreak of pandemics  labor unrest  transport capacity and costs  port security or other events that could slow port activities and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain  including labor  fuel  tariffs  and currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on gross margin  expenses and results of operations 
failure to address product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
if our merchandise offerings  including food  drug and children s products  do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws  and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns  including food or drug contamination  could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 
in addition  negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs  resulting in lost sales 
in those circumstances  it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 
if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests and team members  we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 
the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests and team members 
if we experience a data security breach  we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 
in addition  our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products  decline to use our pharmacy services  or stop shopping at our stores or target 
com altogether 
the loss of confidence from a data security breach involving team members could hurt our reputation and cause team member recruiting and retention challenges 
our failure to comply with federal  state or local laws  or changes in these laws could increase our expenses 
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 
significant legislative changes that affect our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
examples of possible legislative changes affecting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units  the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed  minimum wage requirements  and health care mandates 
in addition  changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit  medicare reimbursements  privacy and information security  product safety or environmental protection  among others  could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  particularly wage and hour laws  we could be subject to legal risk  including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
weather conditions where our stores are located may impact consumer shopping patterns  which alone or together with natural disasters in areas where our sales are concentrated  could adversely affect our results of operations 
uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect consumer shopping patterns  particularly in apparel and seasonal items  which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term results of operations 
in addition  our three largest states  by total sales  are california  texas and florida  areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are more prevalent 
those natural disasters could result in 
table of contents significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers  and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 
our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors 
changes in the tax laws  the interpretation of existing laws  or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective income tax rate is influenced inversely by capital market returns due to the tax free nature of investment vehicles used to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 
if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit  our growth plans  liquidity and results of operations could suffer 
we are dependent on a stable  liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans 
in particular  we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures  the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital  and the asset backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio 
our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets  our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings 
if our credit ratings were lowered  our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted 
each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically  and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same 
in addition  we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk  principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations 
disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements  fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures 
a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations 
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory  process guest transactions and summarize results 
our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  telecommunications failures  computer viruses and malicious attacks  security breaches and catastrophic events 
if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly  we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them  and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our plan to expand retail operations into canada could adversely affect our financial results 
our plan to enter the canadian retail market is our first expansion of retail operations outside of the united states 
our ability to successfully open the expected number of canadian target stores on schedule depends  in large measure  upon our ability to remodel existing assets  build our supply chain capabilities and technology systems and recruit  hire and retain qualified team members 
in addition  access to local suppliers of certain types of goods may limit our ability to offer the expected assortment of merchandise in certain markets 
the effective execution of our strategy is also contingent on our ability to design new marketing programs that positively differentiate us from other retailers in canada 
if we do not effectively execute our expansion plan in canada  our financial performance could be adversely affected
