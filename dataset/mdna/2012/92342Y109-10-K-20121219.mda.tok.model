we believe that these advantages position us well to capitalize on the continuing global shift toward electronic payment transactions 
our industry s growth continues to be driven by the long term shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks  the increasing mobility of payment systems  a growing emphasis on contactless payments  the emergence of payments initiated by consumers through mobile wallets  the development of self service payment systems  the growth of media enabled payment solutions  and continued focus on security to reduce fraud and identity theft 
in the us  we expect that our industry s growth may also be driven by the potential shift to emv smartcard based payments 
we believe that all these trends will continue to drive demand for electronic payment systems in the future 
we have experienced revenue growth in both developed and emerging countries 
in developed countries  we have experienced revenue growth driven mainly by customers upgrading and replacing their systems  for among other reasons to address compliance with security standards or implement new or better functionality 
we also experienced revenue growth from expansion of service offerings 
we have experienced revenue growth in emerging geographies  such as latin america  more specifically brazil  and certain countries in the middle east and africa  due to growing demand for electronic payment systems as a result of improvements in their economic conditions and efforts to modernize these economies to cashless payment systems 
we expect demand to continue to grow in the future  with particular strength in emerging economies 
we continue to devote research and development resources to address the market needs of both emerging and developed economies 

table of contents we operate in two business segments north america and international 
we define north america as the us and canada  and international as all other countries from which we derive revenues 
our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments 
net revenues and operating income loss of each operating segment reflect net revenues and expenses that directly benefit only that segment 
the operating segment performance measures reviewed by our chief executive officer exclude certain costs incurred on a company wide basis  primarily stock based compensation  as well as acquisition related adjustments 
these items are not allocated to our operating segments and are presented in the financial information by segment as corporate 
significant events during the past two fiscal years  we completed acquisitions for the purpose of expanding our product and service offerings  as well as expanding our geographic reach 
our two largest acquisitions  hypercom in august and point in december  have significantly increased our revenues and operating results outside the us additionally  our other acquisitions during fiscal year are expected to contribute to future north america results through new product and service offerings that we intend to also expand internationally 
the results of operations from each of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
see note  business combinations  of this annual report on form k for further information on these acquisitions 
on december   verifone  inc entered into the credit agreement  which initially consisted of a million term a loan  million term b loan  and million revolving loan  of which million was initially funded 
this financing  supplemented by our cash on hand  was used to fund the acquisition of point  repay our previously outstanding loans  fund an escrow account to pay the interest and principal of the senior convertible notes that matured in june  and fund the financing costs related to the credit agreement 
on october   we entered into an additional credit extension amendment to the credit agreement  under which the term a loan was increased by million and the maximum amount available under the revolving loan was increased by million 
see note  financings  of this annual report on form k for additional information 
on june   we received an unfavorable jury verdict in a patent infringement litigation captioned cardsoft  inc and cardsoft assignment for the benefit of creditors  llc v 
verifone holdings  inc et al  in which the jury awarded infringement damages of approximately million based on the jury s determination to apply a per unit royalty on those of our terminals that were subject to the infringement claim 
in addition  although the district court has not yet issued judgment in this matter  cardsoft filed a motion seeking a future royalty higher than the rate awarded by the jury 
given that an ongoing royalty is probable and estimable  effective in our fiscal quarter ended july   when the jury verdict was issued  we accrued per unit to cost of net revenues for potential ongoing royalties 
during the fiscal quarter ended october   we completed redesigns of the terminals subject to the jury s verdict specifically to address cardsoft s allegations  and implemented such redesign in the us we obtained the legal opinion of independent intellectual property counsel that our terminals  as redesigned  do not infringe the cardsoft patents in suit  taking into account the claim construction of the district court in the cardsoft action 
accordingly  although the question of whether our products  as redesigned  infringe the cardsoft patents in suit is subject to determination by a court  whether the district court in the underlying trial or another court  we concluded based on the procedures taken and legal reviews obtained  that it is not probable that an ongoing royalty based on the jury s verdict applies to our terminals as redesigned  and ceased accruing an ongoing royalty on the basis for our implementation of the redesigns 
see further discussion in note  commitments and contingencies  of this annual report on form k for further information on this litigation 
our sources of revenue our payment solutions generally consist of pos electronic payment systems that run our proprietary and third party operating systems  security  encryption  application and certified payment software  as well as other third party value added applications 
our electronic payment systems are available in several modular configurations  offering our customers flexibility to support a variety of connectivity options  including various of the wired and wireless internet connectivity infrastructures deployed globally 
our proprietary architecture enables multiple value added applications  such as gift card and loyalty card programs  healthcare insurance eligibility  and time and attendance tracking  to reside on the same system without requiring recertification when new applications are added to the system 
services are an increasingly important part of our overall revenue mix 
we offer traditional services that span different aspects of the payments ecosystem  including equipment repair or maintenance  gateway processing  remote terminal management  software post contract support  customized application development  helpdesk  customer service  warehousing and encryption or tokenization 
we offer full service solutions  such as point s all in one payment solution also referred to as payment as a service  as well as end to end estate management services 
in addition  we offer more market specific services such as our globalbay mobile retailing software  lift retail services deployed at gas stations and convenience stores  and our digital media 
table of contents solutions  which utilize media enabled equipment to display digital content  such as our vnet verifone digital network  in taxis and at petroleum dispensers at gas stations 
we also offer our customers technical support for our installed payment systems  consulting and project management services for system deployment  and customization of integrated software solutions 
timing of our customer orders may cause our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter 
specifically  revenues recognized in our fiscal quarters can vary significantly when larger customers or our distributors hold back orders due to regulatory or budget concerns 
in addition  revenues can be back end weighted when we receive sales orders and deliver a higher proportion of our system solutions toward the end of our fiscal quarters 
this variability and back end weighting of orders may adversely affect our results of operations in a number of ways and could negatively impact revenues and profits 
first  the product mix of orders may not align with manufacturing forecasts  which could result in a shortage of the components needed for production 
second  existing manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to deliver the desired volume of orders in a concentrated time when they are received 
third  back end weighted demand could negatively impact gross margins through higher labor  delivery and other manufacturing and distribution costs 
if  on the other hand  we were to seek to manage the fulfillment of back end weighted orders through holding increased inventory levels  we would risk higher inventory obsolescence charges if our sales fall short of our expectations 
because our revenue recognition depends on  among other things  the timing of product shipments  decisions we make about product shipments  particularly toward the end of a fiscal quarter  may impact our reported revenues 
the timing of product shipments may depend on a number of factors  including price discussions with our customers  operating costs  including costs of air shipments if required  the delivery date requested by customers and our operating capacity to fill orders and ship products  as well as our own long and short term business planning 
these factors may affect timing of shipments and consequently revenues recognized for a particular period 
critical accounting polices and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  principles of consolidation and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions  and  as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine whether an arrangement exists and what is included in the arrangement 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is probable  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
we routinely enter into customer arrangements involving the long term use of our equipment revenue generating assets 
the assessment of whether these arrangements are operating or sales type leases requires judgment and estimates  including determining the expected residual value of the revenue generating assets at the end of the lease term 
we estimate residual value considering the expected life of the revenue generating assets  which is generally five years 
we periodically enter into software development contracts with our customers that we recognize as net revenues on a completed contract or milestone basis 
the assessment of possible losses on these arrangements requires that we estimate the total costs of the software development project 
changes in these estimates could materially impact our financial results 
we enter into arrangements with customers that include multiple deliverables 
significant judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting for multiple element arrangements including whether elements represent separate deliverables  the esp estimated selling price for each deliverable  the arrangement consideration to be allocated among the deliverables  
table of contents when to recognize net revenues on the deliverables  and whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements 
further  our determination of the esp involves assessing factors such as the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the economic conditions and trends  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
changes in judgments on the above assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers the valuation of inventories requires us to determine obsolete or excess inventory and inventory that is not of salable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventories requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally six months 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write offs  which would have a negative impact on our gross profit percentage 
we review the adequacy of our inventory valuation on a quarterly basis 
for production inventory  our methodology involves an assessment of the marketability of the product based on a combination of shipment history and future demand 
we then evaluate the inventory found to be in excess and take appropriate write downs to reflect the risk of obsolescence 
this methodology is affected by our sales estimates 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory write downs for excess or obsolete inventories may be required 
we record accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to orders placed with our suppliers that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled 
consistent with industry practice  we acquire inventory through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders based on projected demand information 
these commitments typically cover our requirements for periods ranging from one to five months 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of our products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of our products  we may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect our results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs we accrue for estimated warranty obligations at the time that revenue is recognized  and base those accruals on an estimate of future warranty costs for the delivered product 
our warranty obligation generally extends from one to three years from the date of shipment 
we estimate such obligations based on the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection  historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected costs associated with claims  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of our typical experience 
our estimates and judgments are affected by actual product failure rates and actual costs to repair 
these estimates and judgments are more subjective for new product introductions as these estimates and judgments are based on our experience for similar products because we do not yet have actual history or experience for new products 
from time to time we encounter situations where our costs of warranty on a product vary significantly from expectations due to factors including defective parts  defective workmanship  or other unanticipated environmental or usage patterns 
when encountered  a specific reserve is established for these atypical situations on a case by case basis and best available estimates are used to quantify the potential exposure 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  considering the size of each customer s accounts receivable balance  their expected ability to pay  aging of their accounts receivable balances  and our collection history with them 
an appropriate provision is made taking into account these factors 
the company s level of reserves for its customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above and could change significantly if their financial condition changes or the economy in general deteriorates 

table of contents goodwill assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount involves assessing relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting units fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments and assumptions 
these assumptions include identification of macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  verifone specific events and share price trends  whether those trends are more than temporary  and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such impact 
when we perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment  the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
intangible assets we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
contingencies and litigation the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and subject to numerous factors outside of our control 
significant judgment is required when we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to a potential claim or legal proceeding  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  when the outcomes of the claims or proceedings are probable and reasonably estimable 
a determination of the amount of accrued liabilities required  if any  for these contingencies is made after the analysis of each matter 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  we base our estimates on the information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
any revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation plans using fair value recognition and measurement principles and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
in valuing stock based awards  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility and the expected term individuals will hold their stock based awards prior to exercising 
expected volatility of the stock is based on a blend of factors  such as the implied volatility of our options and the historical volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the historical actual term of option grants and an estimate of future exercises during the remaining contractual period of the option 
in the future  our expected volatility and expected term may change  which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
business combinations we are required to estimate the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed of acquired companies 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  customer attrition rates 
table of contents and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
future expected cash flow to be generated from an acquired business is estimated based on the current financial performance of the business  then adjusted for expected market participant synergies that can be realized  the expected timing of future cash flows of all of the acquired business products and services  the expected customer attrition rates and the future growth rates 
the higher the projected cash flows  the higher the value of intangible assets 
discount rates reflect the nature of our investment and the perceived risk of the underlying cash flows 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
we have placed a valuation allowance on certain us foreign tax credit related deferred tax assets and certain non us deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional tax expense in such period 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from the estimates  the amount of the valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is based on detailed facts and circumstances of each issue 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the implementation of asc  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period

table of contents results of operations net revenues our sources of net revenues include products  which include the sale or lease of electronic payment systems with incidental software or accessories  services  which include our all in one payment services  fees for installation and deployment  customer support  repair services  transaction processing  custom software development and extended warranties  as well as advertising or placement in and on taxis and displays at petroleum dispensers  and software  which includes licenses for software to manage electronic payment solutions and encryption  enable mobile payment and provide value added features to payment solutions 
we refer to net revenues from products and associated perpetual software licenses and accessories as system solutions net revenues 
we refer to net revenues from services  equipment leases and term software licenses as services net revenues 
net revenues  which include system solutions and services  are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages years ended october  of total net revenues change change of total net revenues change change of total net revenues system solutions services total net revenues total net revenues grew substantially in each year primarily due to net revenue contributions from acquired businesses 
net revenues were also impacted unfavorably in and slightly favorably in due to fluctuations in currency rates in certain geographies where we conduct business 
when used herein net revenues from acquired businesses  which is measured quarterly  refers to net revenues from businesses acquired during the prior twelve months  and consists of net revenues derived from the sales channels of acquired resellers and distributors  and net revenues from system solutions and services attributable to businesses acquired in the twelve months preceding the respective financial quarters 
for acquisitions of small businesses that are integrated within a relatively short time after the close of the acquisition  we assume quarterly net revenues attributable to such acquired businesses during the twelve months following acquisition remain at the same level as in the first full quarter after the acquisition closed 
fiscal year net revenues included million of net revenues from acquired businesses 
these revenues were comprised of million from point  million from hypercom  and million from other acquisitions 
fiscal year sales by verifone to point totaled million 
fiscal year net revenues included million of net revenues from acquired businesses 
these revenues were comprised of million from hypercom and million from other acquisitions 
we evaluate our revenues geographically based upon our two reportable segments international and north america 
our international segment consists of our business in the emea  lac and aspac territories 
our emea territory is comprised of our operations in europe  the middle east  and africa 
our lac territory consists of our operations in latin america  which includes south america  central america  including mexico  and the caribbean 
our aspac territory consists of our operations in the asia pacific region  including china  india  japan  australia  new zealand and other countries in the region

table of contents growth in net revenues with and without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  is as follows for fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues growth impact due to foreign currency net revenues growth at constant currency net revenues growth impact due to foreign currency net revenues growth at constant currency international emea pts pts lac pts pts aspac pts pts total international pts pts north america pts pts total pts pts excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  our net revenues increased during both of the past two fiscal years primarily due to acquired businesses  increases in customer demand and global expansion of our product and service offerings into new territories 
during fiscal year  these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency rates 
foreign currency had the most significant impact in emea and lac  due to fluctuations in the values of the euro  british pound and brazilian reais 
during fiscal year foreign currency had a small positive impact on our growth rate 
given the large percentage of our business outside the united states  we expect that future growth rates will also be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we refer to our net revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as net revenues at constant currency 
we determine net revenues at constant currency by recomputing net revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars in the current fiscal year using average exchange rates for that particular currency during the corresponding quarter of the prior year 
we use this non gaap measure to evaluate performance on a comparable basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
net revenues at constant currency is a non gaap financial measure  which is information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
our management uses this non gaap measure to evaluate verifone s performance and operations  and to compare verifone s current results with those for prior periods as well as with the results of peer companies 
this non gaap financial measure contains limitations  as it is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and may therefore differ from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
as a result  this non gaap measure should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  disclosures made in accordance with gaap 
net revenues product mix system solutions net revenues as a percent of total net revenues has decreased in each of the past two fiscal years as a result of our emphasis on increasing recurring services net revenues 
the increase in the percentage of services net revenues as a percent of total net revenues in fiscal year is primarily due to our acquisition of point and the million of net revenues derived from their all in one service offering 
additionally  services net revenues grew at a faster pace than system solutions net revenues in both years as we have expanded our managed services offerings  launched a software post contract support program in july in our north america petroleum services group  expanded our taxi media operations  and transitioned legacy taxi media agreements from solution to service oriented arrangements 
we expect to see a continued shift towards a higher proportion of services net revenues relative to total net revenues in fiscal year due to the acquisition of point and our continued development and sales of our services offerings 
we plan to expand the roll out of point s all in one payment solution beyond point s traditional markets and also expect to offer more services to our systems solutions customers 
as we transition to service oriented arrangements to drive increased recurring services net revenues  we may experience a shift in the timing of systems solutions net revenues depending on our performance obligations 
we believe these service offerings will also provide opportunities for increases in recurring revenues 

table of contents system solutions revenues system solutions net revenues are summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages years ended october  change change change change international emea lac aspac total international north america corporate nm total nm not meaningful fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase in net revenues from acquired businesses and a million increase from growth in our legacy operations 
economic improvements in certain international territories are driving infrastructure development initiatives and new product launches are increasing demand 
in addition  net revenues increased as our vx evolution products became certified in new geographies 
the increase in system solutions net revenues from acquired businesses included million from hypercom  million for point and million from other fiscal year and acquisitions 
the international system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and million increase due to international growth 
the emea system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and a million increase in distributor sales 
overall  demand has increased in the region as merchants shift to using less cash and more electronic payment solutions 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in southeast europe due to the timing of customer orders 
in particular  net revenues in turkey decreased million due to the timing of customer orders  exacerbated by the lack of clarity regarding technical specifications required to meet government certification requirements in june for certain payment systems 
to the extent that these or other technical requirements are not clarified  we expect continued delays in customer demand 
net revenues also decreased million in western europe due to a decrease in overall demand in vertical markets  such as banking  retail and petroleum  as a result of consolidation in our banking customer base and timing of large deployment projects 
in europe  net revenues were negatively impacted by fluctuations in the euro and british pound 
the lac system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and a million increase as a result of greater demand throughout the region driven by continued economic growth and the expansion of the electronic payment card industry as these economies modernize 
brazil grew million  primarily due to large electronic payment initiatives as the brazil electronic payment card industry continues to grow rapidly 
we anticipate that growth in the electronic payment card industry in brazil will continue but at decreased year over year rates 
in addition  net revenues are heavily dependent on when these customers place orders 
for example  net revenues from one customer increased million during fiscal  which was offset by a million decrease from another customer 
net revenues increased million in other areas of lac due to increases in customer demand associated with modernization of these economies and the expansion of the electronic payment card industry 
the aspac system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and a million increase  primarily in china and greater asia  due to increased demand in new markets where the payment card industry is expanding  such as indonesia and thailand 
aspac net revenues in developed markets  such as australia and new zealand  were also impacted by the timing of customer orders 

table of contents the north america system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and a million increase in vertical markets due to adoption of newer technologies  particularly our mobile solutions  offset by a million reduction in canada  where the conversion to emv terminals has been largely completed  and a million decrease related to sales to distributors that serve small and medium sized business 
these distributors have reduced their overall inventory levels as part of their ongoing efforts to improve inventory management costs and operational efficiencies 
we believe distributor decisions are driven by a number of factors  including cost management efforts  which may cause distributors to alter their distribution models or inventory levels  timing of changes in standards  such as emv  which in turn impact timing of purchases from us  and each distributor s perception of shifts in demand in their end markets 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year the system solutions net revenues increase was primarily comprised of a million increase in net revenues from businesses acquired in fiscal year and a million increase from growth in our legacy business 
system solutions net revenue increases from acquired businesses included million from hypercom and million from other fiscal year acquisitions 
the international net revenues increase was comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses and million due to growth in our existing operations and expansion in new geographies 
organic growth was a result of economic improvements in some of our existing territories and new product launches which boosted demand 
the increase due to acquired businesses included million from hypercom which we acquired on august   and million from other acquisitions 
the emea net revenues increase was comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses  million increase in russia due to improved economic conditions  million increase in the uk driven by terminal deployment projects  million increase in africa due to increased demand and million increase in turkey associated with vx evolution product launches and improved economic conditions 
the lac net revenues increase was comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses  and a million increase primarily as a result of increased demand throughout the region driven substantially by increased demand for the newly introduced the vx evolution products 
the aspac system solutions net revenues increase was comprised of a million increase from acquired businesses  million in australia and new zealand due to compliance driven terminal upgrades  million in india associated with a terminal deployment cycle that was initiated by financial institutions in the second quarter of fiscal year and million in southeast asia from the addition of new customers  partially offset by an million decrease in china as a result of a long term customer s decision to delay purchases pending an internal asset management audit 
north america system solutions net revenues decreased million as most petroleum customers completed their efforts to address the july pci ped compliance deadlines in fiscal year and million due to the renewal of customer agreements as service rather than system solution arrangements 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in net revenues from our financial solutions market  which sells payment systems to small and medium sized businesses through isos and payment processors and benefited from a reduction in resellers inventory levels in the channel during the prior fiscal year that spurred renewed demand from these resellers in fiscal additionally  the decreases were offset by a million increase in our vertical solutions market due to timing of multi lane retail and vertical market customers upgrading their systems and million related to the semtek business  which we acquired in september and continued to develop 

table of contents outlook improved economic conditions in some parts of the world  particularly latin america  africa and parts of the middle east  have favorably impacted global demand for our products 
in brazil  demand has increased substantially as result of the aggressive distribution of our payment terminals by two of our major distributors to brazilian merchants in anticipation of potential new competition in the acquirer market in brazil 
we cannot predict whether this demand will be sustained 
we have also experienced fluctuations in our net revenues due to the impact of foreign currency changes and are unable to predict how currency rates may change in the future 
moreover  many economies that have experienced economic improvements since the global recession in  including the us  continue to experience some volatility and challenges in achieving sustained economic growth 
in particular  europe continues to experience significant economic volatility and uncertainty  including restrictive credit conditions due to the current european sovereign debt crisis  and the us may experience volatility in the near future due to the impending fiscal cliff when certain tax rates may change and trigger an impact on global economic conditions 
any sustained economic weakness or deterioration in economic conditions  particularly if persistent  would adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we expect international system solutions net revenues to benefit from the addition of our global acquisitions  as well as from the continued overall demand for our products internationally  including growth in emerging markets that continue to adopt electronic payments and create retail establishments 
globally  we expect that changes in payment technologies  our ability to develop and release new products  the timing of customer orders  as well as competitive pressures  may impact our net revenues in the future 
we expect growth in north america system solutions net revenues over the next several years to be driven by anticipated customer refreshes to replace aging terminals and by merchant purchases of more advanced systems in anticipation of the adoption of new technologies  such as nfc and other mobile device enabled payments at the pos 
north america system solutions net revenues are also anticipated to grow as a result of the emv standard that we expect will be adopted in the us over the next several years  as the petroleum market continues to adopt new and more secure payment devices for petroleum dispensers  as our payware mobile enterprise solution grows as a result of retailers seeking to take payment with mobile devices throughout their stores  and as revenues from our acquired businesses continue to benefit from cross selling to legacy verifone customers 
we expect to see a continued shift towards a higher proportion of services net revenues relative to total net revenues in fiscal year due to the acquisition of point and our continued development and sales of our services offerings 
as we transition to service oriented arrangements  we may experience a shift in the timing of systems solutions net revenues depending upon when all of our performance obligations are complete

table of contents outlook worldwide  we have a number of programs underway that we believe will continue to grow services revenues 
we are expanding the roll out of point s all in one payment solution globally  we expect increased transaction and advertising revenues in our verifone media and taxi payments businesses as they expand internationally 
we expect services revenues in north america to increase as a result of growth in software maintenance programs  our media solutions business  and our expanded deployment of media related equipment at petroleum pumps to generate advertising and other service fees or rental revenue streams

gross margin the following table shows the gross margin and gross margin percentages for system solutions and services in thousands  except percentages years ended october  amounts gross margin change points amounts gross margin change points amounts gross margin system solutions services total gross margins improved primarily due to acquisitions of service oriented companies with higher gross margins  the expansion of our higher margin service offerings and lower corporate costs 
system solutions gross margin fiscal year vs 
fiscal year system solutions gross margin improved primarily due to a net million reduction in corporate items 
international system solutions gross margins improved point as a result of higher margin equipment sales by acquired businesses and into new markets 
north america gross margins were comparable year over year 
we include as corporate items the fair value decrease step down in deferred revenue at acquisition  increase to fair value step up of inventory at acquisition  inventory obsolescence and scrap  specific warranty provisions and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
corporate costs decreased due to an million decrease in excess and obsolescence provisions following our transition to the vx evolution generation of products  which had resulted in an million increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory during fiscal year  as well as decreasing reserve requirements on inventory of acquired businesses such as gemalto and hypercom 
it also decreased as a result of an million decrease in product specific warranty reserves and a million decrease in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments as the hypercom inventory fair value adjustment has been fully amortized 
these decreases were partially offset by million in additional amortization of purchased intangible assets given the increase in purchased intangible assets from acquisitions in fiscal year and a million decrease in the step down of deferred revenues related to hypercom 
as described above in the overview to this item  as a result of the unfavorable verdict we received in the ongoing cardsoft patent litigation  the court for the cardsoft matter may order that a royalty be applied to our future sales of the accused products in the us  which may be at the per unit applied by the jury or at such higher rate as the court may determine 
although we believe that we have made changes to ensure that our products are not infringing  the court may not agree 
if the court decides to order such a royalty  the cost per unit of our sales in the us of the products subject to this litigation would be increased by the royalty ordered by the court  which may be the per unit applied by the jury or such higher rate as the court may determine  and our gross margin may be materially adversely impacted 
in fiscal year  subsequent to the jury verdict  we have accrued million of royalties to system solutions cost of net revenues

gross margin also improved in emea because the taxi media business in the united kingdom continued to expand 
lac services gross margin decreased points due to a less favorable mix of customers and service offerings 
north america gross margins dropped points primarily driven by reduced gross margin in our media business due to the higher costs on renewed taxi leases and in new advertising markets where revenues have not yet ramped  and also due to a shift in the mix including new offerings from recently acquired businesses and new initiatives  such as chargesmart and sail  that require initial investment resulting in lower margins 
offsetting corporate items increased million  comprised of an million increased step down in services deferred revenue and million of increased corporate costs 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year services gross margin increased slightly overall because the benefit of improved services gross margins in north america were offset by lower international services gross margins following the acquisition of hypercom 
north america services gross margins increased due to increased sales of higher margin services  such as software maintenance  taxi payment services and advertising 
international services gross margins decreased due to lower margins associated with the hypercom services business in lac  australia and new zealand  gemalto services business in india and investments in the media and taxi payments businesses in the united kingdom 
these decreases were partially offset by non hypercom gross margin improvement in brazil related to repair service cost efficiencies  as well as recognition of previously deferred revenue from several customers in mexico

provision for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is summarized in the following table in thousands  except percentages years ended october  change change change change provision for benefit from income taxes the income tax expense recorded for fiscal year was primarily attributable to earnings from operations in the us the income tax benefit for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance against us federal and state deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the recognition of a worthless stock deduction 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year is lower than the us statutory tax rate due to earnings in countries where we are taxed at lower rates compared to the us federal and state statutory rates and reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities as statutes of limitations expired and issues were resolved 
during january  we entered into a formal settlement with the israeli tax authorities for the calendar year audit and  accordingly  released million of excess accrued tax liabilities associated with this audit 
as of october   on a worldwide basis we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on us generating sufficient us and foreign taxable income in future fiscal years 
based on historical profits and expectations of future results  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to support the 
table of contents release of the valuation allowance of million against the majority of our us federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  we have maintained a valuation allowance on certain us foreign tax credit related deferred tax assets and certain non us deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income is not more likely than not as of october  we intend to maintain the valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was million and million  as of october  and our deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased by million for the fiscal year ended october  primarily attributable to the increase in us foreign tax credit during the year 
the tax loss carry forwards as of october  were primarily related to tax losses in the us of million  in ireland of million  in brazil of million  in sweden of million  in the united kingdom of million  and various other non us countries of million

the remaining balance of approximately million of tax losses is subject to limited carry forward terms of to years 
we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service for fiscal years related to our year net operating loss carry back from fiscal the examination is currently in process with no proposed adjustments to date 
we also have certain foreign subsidiaries under audit  by foreign tax authorities  including brazil for calendar years and  israel for fiscal years to and india for fiscal years to although we believe we have properly provided for income taxes for the years subject to audit  the brazil  israel and indian taxing authorities may adopt different interpretations 
we have not yet received any final determinations with respect to these audits 
we have accrued tax liabilities associated with these audits 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to tax examination for periods prior to we have a singapore pioneer tax holiday for fiscal years through with a one year extension through our fiscal year at the expiration of the tax holiday  our income in singapore will be taxed at the statutory rate of instead of the agreed pioneer tax holiday rate of which may impact our effective tax rate 
as a result of the expiration of the singapore tax holiday at october  we have established a new foreign principal company in another low tax jurisdiction effective november  this will reduce the impact of the expiration of the tax holiday on the effective tax rate 
the tax benefit of the tax holiday for the years ended october    and was million per diluted share  million per diluted share  and million per diluted share 
singapore was the single most significant foreign tax jurisdiction during fiscal year our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including shifts in the mix of pretax profits and losses by tax jurisdiction  loss or cessation of tax holidays or other tax benefit in one or more jurisdictions  our ability to use tax credits  changes in tax laws or related interpretations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  including jurisdictions which currently impose low or no taxes on our operations in those jurisdictions 
effective november   we adopted asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we have recorded our asc liability as a long term liability and we will continue to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced upon closure of tax examinations or if the statute of limitations on certain tax filings expires without assessment from the tax authorities 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that there could be a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitation expirations in multiple tax jurisdictions during the next months that is not material 
interest and penalties accrued on these uncertain tax positions will also be released upon the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations

fiscal year vs 
fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash flows resulting from changes in working capital 
the change in cash provided by operations before changes in working capital was due to a million increase in net income and a million increase in non cash items  offset by a million increase in deferred income taxes 
changes in working capital during the fiscal year ended october  were largely attributable to a million increase in accounts payable due to increased business activities  a million decrease in inventory due to timing of product purchases and shipments  a million increase in deferred revenues due to an increase in sales volume  and a million increase in other current and long term liabilities 
these changes were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased net revenues and billings that were later in the fourth quarter of fiscal year than the same period in fiscal year  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
outlook we expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities as operating profits expand with the growth of the business and as acquisition and integration costs diminish excluding the impact of any future acquisitions

these cash payments were partially offset by million net cash acquired in the csc acquisition 
outlook we expect that cash flows for investing activities will continue for transactions such as business acquisitions  capital expenditures for new service infrastructure to support our global business 
in particular  we expect to make additional investments in revenue generating assets as we expand the roll out of point s all in one payment solution beyond point s traditional markets and as we expand deployment of media related equipment

we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the credit agreement as of october  on march   we entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert million of the term loan a from a floating rate to a fixed rate plus applicable margin 
the interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges 
the interest rate swaps are effective for the period from march  to march  or months

contractual commitments contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  in thousands years ended october  total thereafter credit agreement capital lease obligations and other loans operating leases minimum purchase obligations interest in the above table has been calculated using the rate in effect at october  operating leases includes million of minimum contractual obligations on taxi related leases where payments are based upon taxis in service 
amounts in the above table are based upon the number of operational taxicabs under those arrangements at october  we expect that we will be able to fund our remaining obligations and commitments with future cash flows from our ongoing operations and our million of cash and cash equivalents held as of october  to the extent we are unable to fund these obligations and commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations  we can draw upon the additional amounts available under our credit agreement or future debt or equity financings 

table of contents bank guarantees we have issued bank guarantees to certain of our customers and vendors as required in some countries to support certain of our performance obligations under our service or other agreements with these respective customers or vendors 
as of october   the maximum amounts that may become payable under these guarantees was million 
manufacturing agreements we work on a purchase order basis with third party contract manufacturers with facilities primarily located in china  singapore  malaysia  brazil  germany  romania  and france  and component suppliers located throughout the world to supply nearly all of our finished goods inventories  spare parts  and accessories 
we generally provide each such supplier with a purchase order to cover the manufacturing requirements  which  subject to the underlying terms and conditions  constitutes a binding commitment by us to purchase materials and finished goods produced by the manufacturer as specified in the purchase order 
most of these purchase orders are considered to be non cancelable and are expected to be paid within one year of the issuance date 
as of october   the amount of purchase commitments issued to contract manufacturers and component suppliers totaled approximately million 
of this amount  million has been recorded in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because these commitments are not expected to have future value to us 
we utilize a limited number of third parties to manufacture our products and rely upon these contract manufacturers to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost 
furthermore  a majority of our manufacturing activities are concentrated in china 
as a result  disruptions to the business or operations of the contract manufacturers or to their ability to produce the required products in a timely manner  and particularly disruptions to the manufacturing facilities located in china  could significantly impact our business and operations 
in addition  a number of components that are necessary to manufacture and assemble our systems are specifically customized for use in our products and are obtained from sole source suppliers on a purchase order basis 
because of the customized nature of these components and the limited number of available suppliers  if we were to experience a supply disruption  it would be difficult and costly to find alternative sources in a timely manner 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our borrowings 
these borrowings generally bear interest based upon the one month libor rate 
as of october   a basis point increase in interest rates on our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
on march   we entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert million of the term a loan from a floating rate to a fixed rate plus applicable margin 
the interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting treatment as cash flow hedges 
the interest rate swaps are effective for the period from march  to march  or months 
we generally invest most of our cash in overnight and short term instruments  which would earn more interest income if market interest rates rise and less interest income if market interest rates fall 
foreign currency transaction risk a substantial majority of our sales are made to customers outside the us  and our international sales as a percentage of our total net revenues has increased in recent periods including as a result of growth and our acquisitions of point and hypercom 
a substantial portion of the net revenues we generate from international sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our cost of net revenues and operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro  brazilian real  swedish krona and british pound 
for consolidated reporting  net revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which we refer to as p l exposures  are translated to the us dollar at average currency exchange rates for the period 
thus  even if foreign operating results were stable  fluctuating currency rates may produce volatile reported results 
we have made limited efforts to mitigate p l exposures by hedging with currency derivatives 
however  as of october  and  we had no foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges related to p l exposures 
we may in the future use foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge p l exposures  depending upon the risks of the exposures  the costs of hedging  and other considerations 
however  hedges of p l exposures will only mitigate a portion of our risk and only for a short period 
the balance sheets of our us and international businesses have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the primary currency of such business  which we refer to as balance sheet exposures 
for example  our balance sheet exposures might include monetary assets and liabilities such as canadian dollar receivables held by our us business  or us dollar payables of our united kingdom business 
as exchange rates fluctuate  balance sheet exposures generate foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
most balance sheet exposures will settle in local currency or convert from a foreign currency to a local currency in the foreseeable future  at which time the impact of rate fluctuations will be realized and we will receive or dispense more or less cash than the value originally recorded 
we refer to such exposures as near term balance sheet exposures 
some balance sheet exposures may not be settled in the foreseeable future in management s estimation and thus the cash impact of their currency gains or losses is not expected to be felt in the foreseeable future 
we have in the past and expect to continue in the future to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the risk of near term balance sheet exposures 
our objective is to have gains or losses from the foreign exchange forward contracts largely offset the losses or gains of the near term balance sheet exposures 
on a monthly basis  we recognize the gains or losses based on the changes in fair value of these contracts in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
in some instances  we may seek to hedge transactions that are expected to become near term balance sheet exposures in the very short term  generally within one month 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of october  are presented in the table below in thousands 
the fair market value of the contracts represents the difference between the spot currency rate at october  and the contracted rate 
all of these forward contracts mature within days of october  in thousands currency local currency contract amount currency contracted amount fair market value at october  contracts to buy sell usd argentine peso ars usd australian dollar aud usd brazilian real brl usd canadian dollar cad usd chilean peso clp usd chinese yuan cny usd danish krone dkk usd euro eur usd british pound gbp usd israeli new shekel ils usd indian rupee inr usd south korean won krw usd mexican peso mxn usd norwegian kroner nok usd polish zloty pln usd singapore dollar sgd usd south african rand zar usd swedish krona sek usd taiwan dollar twd usd as of october   our balance sheet exposures  which is the sum of the absolute value of the net assets or net liabilities for each of our foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  amounted to million 
these balance sheet exposures were partially offset by foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional amount of million 
based on our net exposures as of october   a fluctuation in currency exchange rates would result in a gain or loss of approximately million 
as of october   we had one exposure not expected to be paid in the near term  an israeli shekel payable equivalent to million 
excluding this exposure from the israeli subsidiary s net liability exposure of million results in a million net asset position 
deducting the million absolute value difference from our total balance sheet exposures of million results in a total near term balance sheet exposure of million 
a movement in currency exchange rates would result in a gain or loss of approximately million that we would expect to be realized in the foreseeable future 
our efforts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in our balance sheet exposures through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts may not always be effective in protecting us against currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of non us denominated assets and liabilities 
in addition  at times we have not fully offset our balance sheet exposures  leaving us at risk for foreign exchange gains and losses on amounts not offset by forward contracts 
furthermore  historically we have not consistently hedged our p l exposures 
accordingly  if there were an adverse movement in exchange rates  we might suffer significant losses
