healthcare providers and health insurers are also expected to benefit by having additional tools to improve patient care and reduce overall in person and emergency room patient visits 

table of contents authentidate currently operates its business in the united states with technology and service offerings that address emerging growth opportunities based on the regulatory and legal requirements specific to each market 
the business is engaged in the development and sale of web based services largely based on our inscrybe platform and related capabilities and telehealth services featuring our electronic house call and interactive voice response products 
in recent years we have focused our efforts on developing and introducing solutions for use in the healthcare information technology industry 
we believe there are several factors that will be favorable for the healthcare information technology industry in the near future  despite lingering weakness in the global economy 
because healthcare information technology solutions play an important role in healthcare by improving safety  efficiency and reducing cost  they are often viewed as more strategic than other capital purchases 
most united states healthcare providers also recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet regulatory  compliance and government reimbursement requirements and incentive opportunities 
in addition  government agencies  as well as politicians and policymakers appear to agree that the growing cost of our healthcare system is unsustainable 
leaders of both political parties recognize that the intelligent use of information systems will improve health outcomes and  correspondingly  drive down costs 
the broad recognition that healthcare information technology is essential to help control healthcare costs and improve quality contributed to the inclusion of healthcare information technology incentives in the american recovery and reinvestment act arra 
the arra and accompanying health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech provisions include more than billion in incentives for healthcare organizations to modernize operations through meaningful use of healthcare information technology 
we believe that these incentives are contributing to increased demand for healthcare information technology solutions and services in the united states 
another element in the united states marketplace is ongoing healthcare reform which we believe could drive insurance coverage to an estimated million additional consumers and may have many second order effects on our customers 
for example  healthcare providers may face increased volumes that could create capacity constraints  and they may find it challenging to profitably provide care at the planned reimbursement rates under the expanded coverage models 
we also expect additional compliance and reporting challenges for our customers in the areas of pay for quality  coding requirements  and waste  fraud and abuse measures 
we believe the above factors create strong incentives for providers to maximize efficiency and create the need for additional investments in healthcare information technology solutions and services 
thus  while the current economic environment has impacted our business  we believe the fundamental value proposition of healthcare information technology remains strong and that the healthcare information technology industry will likely benefit as healthcare providers and governments continue to recognize that these solutions and services contribute to safer  more efficient healthcare 
in june  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced that more than  health care providers are using electronic health records meeting federal standards and have benefitted from the medicare and medicaid electronic health record incentive programs 
as providers adopt electronic healthcare records  we believe the need for solutions such as those we offer  will be significant 
we believe we are well positioned to benefit from these expected increases in demand due to our product and service offerings 
further  increasingly  health care providers in the us are recognizing that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet regulatory requirements  comply with government reimbursement requirements  and qualify for incentives  all of which should contribute to an increased demand for healthcare information technology solutions and services in the united states 
another aspect of the market for health care information technology is the shift away from fee for service or volume based reimbursement and towards value based or outcomes based reimbursement 
payers  including health insurance companies and federal and state governments are implementing programs to link reimbursement to quality measurements and outcomes  and this alignment creates significant financial motivation for adoption of healthcare information technology products and services 
we believe that there are substantial sums of reimbursement funds that are tied to incentive programs such as value based purchasing  day readmission 
table of contents rules and quality reporting requirements 
we believe that our target markets will need to acquire additional healthcare information technology solutions in order to comply with these programs 
a related recent development is the hospital readmission reduction program which will take effect october  the final rules require hospitals to be financially responsible for the cost of care provided to discharged patients readmitted to the hospital for the same problem within days after discharge 
as a result  we believe more hospitals may be interested in utilizing our discharge management products  which streamline the flow of patient information from the hospital to community providers 
we believe that a growing number of third party studies document how telehealth can positively impact the way healthcare is delivered 
from acute care to chronic care for those living with diabetes  congestive heart failure or hypertension  a wide range of patient populations can benefit from telehealth 
we believe that telehealth products are helping physicians and patients to accomplish a number of goals  including  shifting visits away from high cost settings  reducing the cost of managing patients with chronic diseases  reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions  reducing the duration of hospital stays  improving access to care for patients located in remote areas  and improving outcomes 
general business developments during fiscal year during fiscal we have continued to take steps to refine our core product and service offerings  significantly expand our addressable markets  manage operating costs and position the company for long term growth 
we are focused on refining and marketing our inscrybe healthcare referral management and hospital discharge solutions and our telehealth products and services 
as discussed above  we believe our business will benefit as the federal government healthcare reforms are implemented and as trends in the us healthcare industry to significantly reduce costs  shorten the length of hospital stays  reduce hospital readmissions  shift patient care towards wellness and preventative care programs and automate healthcare records and processes take hold 
although we have taken steps to focus our business in these areas  our progress will be impacted by the timing of customer contracts and implementations and the market acceptance of our products and services 
during this period we have also advanced the development of our telehealth service offerings and continued to refine the capabilities of our electronic house call and interactive voice response products and services 
in april  we announced that we had been selected as a supplier to the department of veterans affairs va for its care coordination home telehealth program and in april we announced that the va had exercised its first one year option to extend the term of our contract  which also includes three additional one year extension options 
in july  the va successfully completed the required test in phase for our electronic house call vital signs monitoring device and web service and we received approval to begin the national rollout of this solution to va facilities throughout the us and its territories 
during the contract period  the company will be committed to provide  subject to purchase orders from the va  telehealth devices and certain associated software solutions 
we believe that the va telehealth project positions the company for success as this market develops in the commercial sector and provides a significant growth opportunity for the company as we work to support the va in its efforts to deliver quality care to our veterans 
there can be no assurance that the va will exercise any of the other option periods under the agreement nor can the company provide any assurances as to the actual amount of products and solutions  if any  that may ultimately be purchased by va facilities under the agreement 
as discussed more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on november  we completed a definitive joint venture termination agreement with our former joint venture partner whereby our joint venture relationship was terminated and expressmd solutions became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
we also entered into a worldwide  perpetual  irrevocable  royalty free  non exclusive license to use the intellectual property of our former joint venture partner and an affiliated company  as needed  to continue to develop our telehealth products and services 
we believe this transaction provides us with greater flexibility to meet emerging market needs in the telehealth space and enables us to continue to offer innovative and leading edge products and solutions to our customers 

table of contents we intend to continue our efforts to market our software applications  web based services and related products in our target markets 
we also intend to focus on identifying additional applications and markets where our technology can address customer needs 
our current revenues consist principally of transaction fees for web based hosted software services 
from our telehealth business we generate revenues from hardware sales  monthly monitoring services and maintenance fees 
for the fiscal year ended june  three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
growth in our business is affected by a number of factors  including general economic and business conditions  and is characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of customer contracts  implementations and ramp up to full utilization can have a significant impact on results and we believe our results over a longer period of time provide better visibility into our performance

authentiproof can be used to verify the authenticity of a document or file sent electronically as of a specific point in time and allows users to detect whether or not documents or files with an authentiproof seal have been altered or modified 
authentiproof incorporates our proprietary content authentication technology 
sales and marketing we sell our web based services and telehealth products and services through a direct sales effort  reseller arrangements and group purchasing organizations gpos 
our resellers and gpos typically receive a commission based on a percentage of the value of customer agreements we enter into due to their efforts 
in cases where our contracts have a term exceeding one year  we generally defer service revenue derived from these 
table of contents contracts and recognize it over the life of the contract 
the markets for healthcare devices and solutions include integrated delivery networks  physician groups and networks  managed and accountable care organizations  hospitals  medical centers  home health agencies  pharmacies  governments and public health organizations 
supply relationships we use at t inc  to provide and maintain a secure hosting center at a facility in new york to host our web based services 
we believe that there are sufficient alternative suppliers of these services 
we augment our own staff of software developers by using third party consultants and our software and services incorporate products and services which we license from unaffiliated third parties 
we also use a contract manufacturer to assemble our electronic house call telehealth monitor and several suppliers for various component parts and services 
we believe that adequate alternative suppliers of these products and services exist on commercially reasonable terms so as to mitigate any adverse impacts caused by the termination of any of our existing relationships 
competition we compete in markets for our web based services and our telehealth products and services that are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
although we believe there is no single company that directly competes with all of our services and solutions  we do face intense competition from other companies with respect to our various offerings 
further  we are aware of efforts by other companies to develop products or services to either compete directly with our services  solutions  and products or that could be used as alternatives to our offerings 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our services and solutions include features such as ease of use  quality reliability of our offerings  scalability  features and functionality  customer service and support and price 
although we believe that our services  solutions and products compete favorably in respect of all these factors  there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current or potential competitors 
these companies offer fax products  web based processing of medical forms  signature solutions and patient monitoring products and services that could compete with our services  solutions and products 
almost all of these competitors are substantially larger or have more experience and market share than we do in their respective markets 
in addition  companies with which we do not presently directly compete may become competitors in the future through their product development in the area of secure online services and telehealth services and such companies may have greater financial  technological  and marketing resources than we do 
therefore  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards and customer requirements 
many of these competitors also have broader and more established distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or services directly to customers through bundling or other means 
if such competitors were to bundle competing products or services for their customers  the demand for our products and services might be substantially reduced and the ability to distribute our products successfully and the utilization of our services would be substantially diminished 
new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies may increase competitive pressure 
we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
in addition  our markets are characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving our competitors 
the existence or announcement of any such relationships could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  and competitive pressures that we face could materially harm our business

however  this matter is subject to inherent uncertainties and management s assessment may change 
employees at june   we employed full time employees throughout our operations  including our senior management 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
in the normal course of business  we also use part time employees and contract with third parties to provide support for various projects 
government regulation government matters compliance with federal  state  local  and foreign laws  including laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations  or competitive position 
although we do not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of our operations  no assurance can be given such laws  or any future laws enacted  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
government regulation of medical devices government authorities in the united states at the federal  state and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution  sampling  marketing  and import and export of medical devices 
in april  we received clearance for the telehealth device marketed by the company 
various federal  state  local and foreign statutes and regulations also govern testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  distribution and record keeping related to such products and their marketing 
the process of obtaining these approvals and clearances  and the subsequent process of maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal  state  local  and foreign statutes and regulations  can require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources 
in addition  statutes  rules  regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals 
under the federal food drug and cosmetic act  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  class ii or class iii 
the classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness 
class i and ii devices must be able to demonstrate safety and efficacy by adhering to a set of general controls  including compliance with the applicable portions of the fda s quality system regulation  which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements  facility registration  device listing and product reporting of adverse medical events  truthful and non misleading labeling  and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses 
class ii devices are also subject to these general controls  and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
review and clearance by the fda for these devices is typically accomplished through the so called k pre market notification procedure 
when k clearance is sought  a sponsor must submit a pre market notification 
table of contents demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class ii device for example  a device previously cleared through the k pre market notification process 
if the fda agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device  then k clearance to market will be granted 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require pre market approval  or pma 
the fda has categorized our telehealth product as a class ii device 
both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed  manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations 
the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices  labeling and record keeping  and manufacturers required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices 
device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the fda for compliance with the quality system regulation  which sets forth the current good manufacturing practice requirements that govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  servicing  labeling  storage  installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use 
fda regulations prohibit the advertising and promotion of a medical device for any use outside the scope of a k clearance or pma approval or for unsupported safety or effectiveness claims 
although the fda does not regulate physicians practice of medicine  the fda does regulate manufacturer communications with respect to off label use 
if the fda finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply with fda laws and regulations or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk  it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or pma approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device 
third party reimbursement our telehealth product is used for medical purposes generally covered by government or private health plans 
in general  a third party payor only covers a medical product or procedure when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure improves health outcomes  including quality of life or functional ability  in a safe and cost effective manner 
even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the fda  there is no assurance that third party payors will cover the cost of the device and related procedures 
in many instances  third party payors use price schedules that do not vary to reflect the cost of the products and equipment used in performing those procedures 
in other instances  payment or reimbursement is separately available for the products and equipment used  in addition to payment or reimbursement for the procedure itself 
even if coverage is available  third party payors may place restrictions on the circumstances where they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products 
third party payors who cover the cost of medical products or equipment  in addition to allowing a general charge for the procedure  often maintain lists of exclusive suppliers or approved lists of products deemed to be cost effective 
authorization from those third party payors is required prior to using products that are not on these lists as a condition of reimbursement 
if our products are not on the approved lists  healthcare providers must determine if the additional cost and effort required in order to obtain prior authorization  and the uncertainty 
table of contents of actually obtaining coverage  is justified by any perceived clinical benefits from using our products 
if hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact 
health care reform on march   the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law and on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
together  the two measures make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the us healthcare system since the creation of medicare and medicaid 
the health care reform laws include a large number of health related provisions to take effect over the next four years  including expanding medicaid eligibility  requiring most individuals to have health insurance  establishing new regulations on health plans  establishing health insurance exchanges  requiring manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  and modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste  including through new tools to address fraud and abuse 
effective in  there will be a excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices 
fraud and abuse laws we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  which  among other things  prohibit the offer or acceptance of remuneration intended to induce or in exchange for the purchase of products or services reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and the submission of false or fraudulent claims with the government 
these laws include the federal anti kickback statute  the false claim act and comparable state laws 
these laws regulate the activities of entities involved in the healthcare industry  such as us  by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements such entities may have with healthcare providers who use or recommend the use of medical products including for example  sales and marketing programs  advisory boards and research and educational grants 
in addition  in order to ensure that healthcare entities comply with healthcare laws  the office of inspector general  or oig  of the us department of health and human services recommends that healthcare entities institute effective compliance programs 
to assist in the development of effective compliance programs  the oig has issued model compliance program guidance  or cpg  materials for a variety of healthcare entities which  among other things  identify practices that may implicate the federal anti kickback statute and other relevant laws and describes elements of an effective compliance program 
violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties  damages  imprisonment  fines  exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
hipaa two federal crimes were created under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters 
the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program  including private payors 
the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits  items or services 
individually identifiable health information is subject to an array of federal and state regulation 
federal rules promulgated pursuant to hipaa regulate the use and disclosure of health information by covered entities 
covered entities include individual and institutional healthcare providers from which we may receive individually identifiable health information 
these regulations govern  among other things  the use and disclosure of health information for research purposes  and require the covered entity to obtain the written authorization of the individual before using or disclosing health information for research 
failure of the covered entity to obtain such authorization could subject the covered entity to civil and criminal penalties 
we may experience delays and complex negotiations as we deal with each entity s 
table of contents differing interpretation of the regulations and what is required for compliance 
also  where our customers or contractors are covered entities  including hospitals  universities  physicians or clinics  we may be required by the hipaa regulations to enter into business associate agreements that subject us to certain privacy and security requirements 
in addition  many states have laws that apply to the use and disclosure of health information  and these laws could also affect the manner in which we conduct our research and other aspects of our business 
such state laws are not preempted by the federal privacy law where they afford greater privacy protection to the individual 
while activities to assure compliance with health information privacy laws are a routine business practice  we are unable to predict the extent to which our resources may be diverted in the event of an investigation or enforcement action with respect to such laws 
hipaa regulations also require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
moreover  the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  and associated regulatory requirements  extend many of the hipaa obligations  formerly imposed only upon covered entities  to business associates as well

table of contents item a 
risk factors as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  we wish to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors  among others discussed throughout this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   have affected  and in some cases could affect  our actual results of operation and cause our results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected due to any of the following risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
in assessing these risks  you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our business failure to increase our revenue and keep our expenses consistent with revenues could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately   including a loss of approximately  related to discontinued operations for our former german subsidiary  and  for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively and had an accumulated deficit of approximately  at june  we have expended  and will continue to be required to expend  substantial funds to pursue product development projects  enhance our marketing and sales efforts and to otherwise operate our business 
therefore  we will need to generate higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in any future period 
our prospects should be considered in light of the difficulties frequently encountered in connection with the establishment of a new business line  which characterizes our business  such as the difficulty in creating a viable market  the significant related development and marketing costs and the overall competitive environment in which we operate 
this risk may be more acute in light of our disposition of our other operating segments 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitable operations in future operating periods 
our business results are likely to remain uncertain as we are unable to reliably predict revenues from our current customers 
revenue levels achieved from our customers  the mix of products and solutions that we offer  our ability to introduce new products as planned and our ability to reduce and manage our operating expenses will affect our financial results 
consequently  we may not be profitable in any future period 
our capital requirements have been significant and we may need to raise additional capital to finance our operations 
our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
we have been substantially dependent upon private placements and registered offerings of our securities and on short term and long term loans to fund such requirements 
we are expending significant amounts of capital to develop  promote and market our software  services and products 
due to these expenditures  we have incurred significant losses to date 
we used approximately   and  in cash for continuing operating activities for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
our available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june  totaled approximately  we expect our existing resources  proceeds from the million senior note transaction completed in september  revenues generated from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants of which there can be no assurance to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  these resources may not be sufficient if we are required to redeem our outstanding shares of series b and series c preferred stock within the next months 
if we are required to redeem these securities within the next months  we may need to renegotiate the terms of such securities  if necessary  to enable us to manage our cash resources 
no assurances can be given  however  that we will be able to attain sales levels and support our costs through revenues derived from operations  generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our other obligations or successfully modify the terms of 
table of contents these securities  or that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
if our available cash resources and projected revenue levels are not sufficient to sustain our operations  or otherwise meet our cash needs  we will need to raise additional capital to fund operations and to meet our obligations in the future 
to meet our financing requirements  we may raise funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic alliances 
raising additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities may cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution in their ownership interests and new investors may have rights superior to the rights of our other stockholders 
raising additional funds through debt financing  if available  may involve covenants that restrict our business activities and options 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in raising additional capital or securing financing when needed or on terms satisfactory to the company 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required  or on acceptable terms  we will need to reduce costs and operations substantially  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase substantially as a result of many factors  including our need to utilize a significant amount of cash to support research and development activities and to make incremental investments in our organization  our ability to achieve targeted gross profit margins and cost management objectives  our ability to reach break even or profitability  the extent to which we consolidate our facilities and relocate employees and assets  the success of our sales and marketing efforts  our potential need to redeem our outstanding shares of preferred stock  our need to repay our outstanding secured notes  the extent and terms of any development  marketing or other arrangement  and changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions  including the current financial crisis 
our revenues may be affected by changes in technology spending levels 
in the past  unfavorable or uncertain macroeconomic conditions and reduced global technology spending rates have adversely affected the markets in which we operate 
current economic conditions and uncertainty about the recovery could reduce the demand for our products and negatively impact revenues and operating profit 
we are unable to predict changes in general macroeconomic conditions and when global spending rates will be affected 
furthermore  even if spending rates increase  we cannot be certain that the market for our products and solutions will be positively impacted 
if there are future reductions in spending rates  or if spending rates do not increase  our revenues  operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
for the past few years  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to obtain financing for operations or obtain credit from trade creditors were to be impaired 
in addition  the recent economic crisis could also adversely impact our customers ability to finance the purchase of our products and solutions  which may negatively impact our business and results of operations 

table of contents healthcare policy changes  including recent laws to reform the us healthcare system  may have a material adverse effect on us 
healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade 
there have been  and continue to be  proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party payors to keep these costs down 
certain proposals  if passed  could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products  or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
these limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
on march   the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law and on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
together  the two measures make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the us healthcare system since the creation of medicare and medicaid 
the health care reform laws include a large number of health related provisions to take effect over the next four years  including expanding medicaid eligibility  requiring most individuals to have health insurance  establishing new regulations on health plans  establishing health insurance exchanges  requiring manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  and modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste  including through new tools to address fraud and abuse 
effective in  there will be a excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices 
further  as administrative rules implementing healthcare reform under the legislation are not yet finalized  the impact of the healthcare reform legislation on our business is unknown  and there can be no assurances that healthcare reform legislation will not adversely impact either our operational results or the manner in which we operate our business 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our solutions and services 
in addition  various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level 
we cannot predict the exact effect newly enacted laws or any future legislation or regulation will have on us 
however  the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products  reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business  possibly materially 
in addition  the enacted excise tax may materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and results of operations 
we may need to incur additional costs in our efforts to successfully commercialize the technology supporting our content authentication service 
in july  we entered into a new three year license agreement with the us postal service usps to act as a non exclusive authorized service provider of the usps electronic postmark epm 
we had operated the epm service on behalf of the usps since march  under a strategic alliance agreement that expired on july  this license agreement was allowed to expire as of december   in accordance with its terms 
the usps has notified the company that it hopes to develop a revised framework for the next generation of the usps epm and may revamp the program in the future and has engaged the company to provide verification services through march for epms issued through march the usps and the company continue to work towards ensuring a smooth transition from the usps epm brand and the company will continue to provide customers with uninterrupted content authentication and time and date stamping services utilizing its proprietary intellectual property rights as it transitions to its own content authentication services under the authentiproof brand 
this transition will not impact the performance or capabilities of our other products and solutions  including our suite of incsrybe offerings and the telehealth products and services 
we depend on growth in the software as a service market  and lack of growth or contraction in this market could materially adversely affect our sales and financial condition 
our hosted software and web based solutions compete with other software as a service solutions 
demand for our solutions and software offerings is driven by several factors  including an increased focus on protecting business critical applications  government and industry regulations requiring data protection and integrity  and 
table of contents the growth in the market for software as a service 
segments of the computer and software industry have in the past experienced significant economic downturns and decreases in demand as a result of changing market factors 
a change in the market factors that are driving demand for offerings of software as a service could adversely affect our sales  profitability and financial condition 
we depend on third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our telehealth appliance  which may result in delays and quality control issues 
we do not own or lease any manufacturing facilities 
accordingly  in order to market our telehealth solution we purchase components and finished appliances from unaffiliated suppliers and a contract manufacturer 
in addition  we use unaffiliated third parties to provide distribution services for this solution 
if the agreements with these third parties are terminated or if they are unable to perform their obligations under such agreements  it could take several months to establish and qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturing and distribution partners for our products and we may not be able to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner 
at the present time we believe that if existing third party relationships terminate  alternative providers are available on commercially reasonable terms 
however  there can be no assurance that the future production capacity of our current manufacturer will be sufficient to satisfy our requirements or that alternative providers of components or manufacturing or distribution services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the failure to identify suitable alternative supplies  manufacturers or distributors could adversely impact our customer relationships and our financial condition 
in addition  due to our use of third party manufacturers and distributors  we do not have control over the timing of product shipments 
delays in shipment could result in the deferral or cancellation of purchases of our products  which would harm our results of operations in any particular quarter 
net revenue for a period may be lower than predicted if large orders forecasted for that period are delayed or are not realized  which could impact cash flow or result in a decline in our stock price 
our business may be adversely affected by legal proceedings 
we have been in the past  and may become in the future  involved in legal proceedings 
you should carefully review and consider the various disclosures we make in our reports filed with the sec regarding legal matters that may affect our business 
as described in greater detail below  our expressmd solutions subsidiary was served with a summons and complaint in a purported patent infringement lawsuit filed by robert bosch healthcare systems  inc alleging that the expressmd solutions electronic house call product infringes one or more claims of certain patents allegedly owned by the plaintiff 
expressmd solutions filed an answer to the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that the patents are invalid and not infringed 
we believe that we have strong defenses to plaintiff s allegations and we intend to vigorously defend the litigation 
however  civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and outcomes can result in excessive verdicts  fines  penalties and or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business 
the expense of defending such litigation may be substantial and the time required to defend the actions could divert management s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any legal proceedings in which we become involved and it is difficult to estimate the possible costs to us stemming from any such matters 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our success is dependent on the performance of our management and the cooperation  performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management team and executive officers 
if our management team is unable to perform it may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
the loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 

table of contents if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  finance  and other critical personnel 
other than with respect to employment agreements that we entered into with our ceo and cfo  our key personnel do not have employment agreements and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
if the carrying value of our long lived assets is not recoverable  an impairment loss must be recognized which would adversely affect our financial results 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  licenses  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
as discussed more fully in notes to consolidated financial statements  in april we completed the sale of our german subsidiary and information for such subsidiary has been presented as discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented 
in connection with the sale of the subsidiary  we recorded a non cash loss of approximately  related to the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of this subsidiary in the company initially recorded the estimated loss related to its german subsidiary as a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  during the quarter ended december  based primarily on lowered expectations for growth in future revenues and cash flows  certain unsolicited market information regarding the business and uncertainty regarding the recovery in the market for comparable assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived assets  and we may incur substantial impairment charges  which could adversely affect our financial results 
developing and implementing new or updated software and services and other product offerings may take longer and cost more than expected 
we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our software and services 
the cost of developing new software  services and other product offerings  such as inscrybe healthcare and related modules  and our telehealth offerings is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development and implementation of proposed software  services or other product offerings may take longer than originally expected  require greater investment of cash resources than initially expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
accordingly  we expect to face substantial uncertainties with respect to the performance and market acceptance of new software and services and other product offerings 
if we are unable to develop new or updated software  services or other product offerings on a timely basis and implement them without significant disruptions to the existing systems and processes of our customers  we may lose potential revenues and harm our relationships with current or potential customers 
the success of any of our product acquisition and licensing activities is subject to uncertainty and any completed acquisitions or licenses may reduce our earnings  be difficult to integrate  not perform as expected or require us to obtain additional financing 
we regularly evaluate selective acquisitions and look to continue to enhance our product line by acquiring rights to additional products and services 
such acquisitions may be carried out through the purchase of assets  joint ventures and licenses or by acquiring other companies 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able 
table of contents to complete acquisitions or in licensing arrangements that meet our target criteria on satisfactory terms  if at all 
successfully integrating a product or service acquisition or in licensing arrangement can be a lengthy and complex process 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with any of our acquisitions or arrangements could result in the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that could negatively affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  suppliers  employees and others with whom we have business dealings 
in addition  other companies  including those with substantially greater resources than ours  may compete with us for the acquisition of product or in licensing candidates and approved products  resulting in the possibility that we devote resources to potential acquisitions or arrangements that are never completed 
if we do engage in any such acquisition or arrangement  we will incur a variety of costs  and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or arrangement in light of those costs 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions or arrangements we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks or other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  our product acquisition and licensing activities may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing  resulting in increased debt obligations or dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders  as applicable 
therefore  we may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us  if at all 
new or updated software  services and product offerings will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance  which may require significant efforts and costs 
there can be no assurance that customers and potential customers will accept from us new or updated software  services and other products 
the future results of our business will depend  in significant part  on the success of our software  services or other product offerings 
current and potential customers may choose to use similar products and services offered by our competitors or may not purchase new or updated software  services or products  especially when they are initially offered and if they require changes in equipment or workflow 
for software  services and products we are developing or may develop in the future  there can be no assurance that we will attract sufficient customers or that such offerings will generate sufficient revenues to cover their associated development  marketing and maintenance costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new software and services or other product offerings will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or updated software  services and product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
further  achieving market acceptance for new or updated software  services and product offerings is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
we do not have patents on all the technology we use  which could harm our competitive position 
presently  we have one issued us patent 
we also have been granted a license to one issued us patent and one pending patent application by authentidate international ag  and to two us patents by our former joint venture partner and their affiliate 
some of the technology embodied in some of our current products cannot be patented 
we have registered the trademarks authentidate  inscrybe  authentiproof and inscrybe office in the us  the trademark authentidate in canada  mexico and the european community  inscrybe in the european community and canada  inscrybe office  and a number of other trademarks as madrid protocol international registrations 
we have also filed trademark applications in the united states for the trademark inscrybemd 
we continue to take steps to protect our intellectual property rights including filing additional trademark and patent applications where appropriate 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with our key employees to the extent we deem it to be necessary 
we further intend to file patent applications for any new products we may develop  to the extent that we believe that any technology included in such products is patentable 
there can be no assurance that any patents in fact  will be issued or that any such patents that do issue will be effective to protect our products and services from duplication by other manufacturers or developers or to 
table of contents prevent our competitors from offering similar products and services 
other companies operating within our business segments may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise obtain access to our know how  much of which is maintained as trade secrets and there can be no assurance that we will be able to afford the expense of any litigation which may be necessary to enforce our rights under any patent 
in addition  with respect to our telehealth offerings  in connection with the termination of the joint venture  our former joint venture partner and an affiliate licensed to us certain intellectual property assets to enable us to continue to commercialize and develop the expressmd solutions remote patient monitoring products and services 
accordingly  our right to utilize any such intellectual property is subject to the terms of this agreement 
further  and similar to the intellectual property owned by us  there can be no assurance that the intellectual property licensed to us will be effective to protect our products and services from duplication by other manufacturers or developers or to prevent our competitors from offering similar products and services 
we have investigated patents held by third parties of which we are aware and we believe that our products and services  including our telehealth offerings  do not infringe on the claims of these patents 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that our products and services do not infringe upon any third party patents or violate the proprietary rights of others  including the patents we have investigated  and it is possible that such infringement or violation has occurred or may occur 
as described in greater detail below  on january   our expressmd solutions subsidiary was served with a summons and complaint in a purported patent infringement lawsuit filed by robert bosch healthcare systems  inc alleging that the expressmd solutions electronic house call product infringes one or more claims of certain patents allegedly owned by the plaintiff 
expressmd solutions filed an answer to the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking declarations that the patents are invalid and not infringed 
we believe that we have strong defenses to plaintiff s allegations and we intend to vigorously defend the litigation 
in addition  we intend to exercise our rights of set off and indemnification as against encountercare solutions  inc and the co licensor to us of the patents in issue 
in the event that products we sell or services we provide are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could be required to modify our products and or services or obtain a license for the manufacture  use and or sale of such products and services 
there can be no assurance that  in such an event  we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all  and the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to defend against a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
in addition  if our products  services or proposed products or services are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others  we could  under certain circumstances  become liable for damages or subject to an injunction  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
because we currently derive a majority of our revenues from a few hosted software and web based service offerings  any decline in demand for these offerings could severely harm our ability to generate revenues 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from a limited number of hosted software and web based service offerings 
in addition  our focus on building our business is concentrated on markets for hosted software and web based services where content integrity  workflow automation  electronic signatures  time and date stamping and web based services are important to customers 
as a result  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for these offerings  whether as a result of competition  product obsolescence  technological change  customer spending  or other factors 
if our revenues derived from our hosted software and web based service offerings were to decline significantly  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
as a result  if our relationships with significant customers were disrupted we could lose a significant percentage of our anticipated revenues which could have material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  and the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by  one or more of these customers could adversely affect our operating results 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
most of our customer orders for our telehealth business  including any business we may derive from our agreement with the us department of veterans affairs  are expected to be made on a purchase order basis  which does not generally require any long term commitments nor any minimum purchase requirements 
therefore  these customers may alter their past purchasing behavior with little or no notice to us for various reasons 
if our customers alter their past or expected purchasing behavior  or if we encounter any problems collecting amounts due from them  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
some of our hosted software and web based service offerings have long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our quarterly operating results 
transactions for some of our hosted software and web based service offerings may require customers to undertake customized installations to integrate the solutions into their legacy systems and require them to modify existing business practices 
the period from our initial contact with a potential customer until the execution of an agreement is difficult to predict and can be in excess of six to twelve months 
the sales cycles for these transactions can be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as customers budgetary constraints  the need to educate potential customers about our software and service offerings  the timing of customers budget cycles  delays caused by customers internal review processes  customers willingness to invest resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our offerings  and for sales to government customers  governmental regulatory approval and purchasing requirements 
we are unable to control or influence many of these factors 
further  we have experienced delays in the pace of adoption and use by our customers of our transaction based offerings  such as inscrybe healthcare  which has adversely affected our earnings 
we may experience similar delays with our other products and services and products and services currently under development 
during the sales cycle and the implementation period  we may expend substantial time  effort and money preparing contract proposals  negotiating contracts and implementing solutions without receiving any related revenue 
in addition  many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  including personnel costs and technology and infrastructure costs 
accordingly  our inability to generate sufficient revenues from these offerings has a direct impact on our results of operations 
our contract award with the us department of veterans affairs  consistent with us government contacts generally  includes special contracting requirements that give the government the ability to unilaterally control our contracts 
in april  we announced that we had received a contract award from the us department of veterans affairs the va pursuant to which the company was selected as a supplier to the va for its telehealth program for home telehealth solutions 
the award is for a national contract and under this agreement the company will market its telehealth solution  to va facilities throughout the country 
the agreement consists of a one year base period that commenced may  and four option years  which are at the va s sole discretion 
there is no minimum purchase requirement under the contract 
on april   the va exercised the first extension option  however  there can be no assurance that the va will exercise any of the other option periods under the agreement nor can the company provide any assurances as to the actual amount of products and solutions  if any  that may ultimately be purchased by va facilities under the agreement 

table of contents in addition  us government contracts typically contain unilateral termination provisions for the government and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion  which will subject us to additional risks 
these risks include the ability of the us government unilaterally to suspend or prevent us for a set period of time from receiving new contracts or extending existing contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  terminate our contracts  including if funds become unavailable or are not provided to the applicable governmental agency  delay the issuance of the additional security clearances for our employees which may be necessary for the company to perform under the agreement  or revoke such clearances  reduce the scope and value of our contracts and or revise the timing for work to be performed  audit and object to our contract related costs and fees  including allocated indirect costs  control and potentially prohibit the export of our products  claim rights to products  including intellectual property  developed under the contract  and change certain terms and conditions in our contracts 
the us government will be able to terminate its contract with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms 
termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses  and profit on the work completed prior to termination 
termination for default provisions do not permit these recoveries and would make us liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 
due to the economic downturn  the accompanying fall in tax revenues  and the us government s efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the healthcare administration field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
our business with the va is subject to audit by the us government and a negative audit could adversely affect our business 
us government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
audits may also review the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must be refunded 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the us government 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us 

table of contents laws and regulations affecting government contracts make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business 
we must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  which can make it more difficult for us to retain our rights under these contracts 
these laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with government agencies 
among the most significant government contracting regulations that affect our business are the federal acquisition regulation  or far  and agency specific regulations supplemental to the federal acquisition regulation  which comprehensively regulate the procurement  formation  administration and performance of government contracts  the business ethics and public integrity obligations  which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees  restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the anti kickback act  the procurement integrity act  the false claims act and foreign corrupt practices act  export and import control laws and regulations  and laws  regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data 
any changes in applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to maintain our existing contracts and obtain new contracts  which could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the failure to properly manage our growth could cause our business to lose money 
we are using our sales and marketing efforts in order to develop and pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this growth is expected to place a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems and controls  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
healthcare industry consolidation could impose pressure on our price  reduce our potential client base and reduce demand for our offerings 
many hospitals and health care centers have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power 
if this consolidation trend continues  it could reduce the size of our potential customer base and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power  which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services 
in addition  this consolidation could also erode our revenue base 
our hosted software and web based services and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our software and web based services  we may be affected by such efforts in the future 
further  despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems  resulting in the potential misappropriation of our proprietary information or interruptions of our services 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could substantially disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and reduce demand for our services 

table of contents performance problems with our systems or system failures could cause us to lose business or incur liabilities 
our customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we experience transmission delays or failures or loss of data in the systems we use to provide services to our customers  including transaction related services 
these systems are complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that problems will not occur or that they will be detected and corrected promptly if they do occur 
in providing these services  we rely on internal systems as well as communications and hosting services provided by third parties  such as the internet 
to operate without interruption  both we and the service providers we use must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in the event of a catastrophic event at our data center or any third party facility we use  we may experience an extended period of system unavailability  which could negatively impact our business 
further  if such an event caused the loss of stored data  it could have a material adverse impact on our business or cause us to incur material liabilities 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
in addition  some of our web based services may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than expected volumes of traffic 
at those times  we may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or slow down in their response times could damage our relationships with customers 
further  the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it which could harm its reliability and performance 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of services and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
we are subject to product liability risks associated with the production  marketing and sale of products used in the healthcare industry 
the production  marketing and sale of devices used in the health care industry have inherent risks of liability in the event of product failure or claim of harm caused by product operation 
furthermore  even meritless claims of product liability may be costly to defend against 
the commercialization of the telehealth device exposes us to such claims 
these types of product liability claims may result in decreased demand for this product  injury to our reputation  related litigation costs  and substantial monetary awards to plaintiffs 
we attempt to limit by contract our liability  however  the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we may also be subject to claims that are not covered by contract  such as a claim directly by a patient 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage  and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost 
our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could inhibit the commercialization of any products that we develop 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our products or processes  then our liability could exceed our product liability insurance coverage and our total assets 

table of contents we need to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to our telehealth product and our ability to generate revenue from this product is subject to our ability to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement from payors of healthcare costs 
our telehealth product is a medical device that is subject to extensive regulation in the united states 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the us food and drug administration  or the fda  before the product can be sold 
either process can be lengthy and expensive 
the fda s k clearance procedure  also known as premarket notification  is the process we have used for our current telehealth product 
the regulatory clearance for our telehealth product provides for its use for its intended purposes 
in addition  the manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion  distribution and record keeping for approved products are subject to extensive regulation 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or we otherwise fail to comply with other fda regulations  we may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions  including a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine  suspensions  loss of regulatory clearance  product recalls or product seizures 
in the more egregious cases  criminal sanctions  civil penalties  or disgorgement of profits are possible 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems may also result in restrictions on the marketing of our products  and could include voluntary or mandatory recall or withdrawal of products from the market 
further  we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we will not be permitted to market our products and our business would suffer 
in addition  our ability to commercialize our telehealth product successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate coverage and reimbursement levels for the cost of this product are obtained by us or by our direct customers from governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental payors is critical to the success of medical technology device companies as the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay 
the cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from this product and our profitability 
in addition  given ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare  the united states congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform and the reform of the medicare and medicaid payment systems 
while we cannot predict whether any proposed cost containment measures will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could reduce the price that we receive for our telehealth product in the future 
we cannot predict the outcomes of any of legislative or regulatory efforts at reducing costs of providing healthcare and regulatory changes in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local  state and federal level 
in addition to regulatory requirements concerning the commercialization of medical devices  we are subject to a significant and wide ranging number of regulations both within the united states and elsewhere  such as regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud and the security and privacy of patient data 
healthcare fraud 
federal and state governments continue to enhance regulation of and increase their scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
our healthcare provider clients are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which  among other things  prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs 
federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding  powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse 
the effect of this government regulation on our clients is difficult to predict 
many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be applicable to us  including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with medical 
table of contents device sales  are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts 
they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us 
if such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  sanctions or other liability  including exclusion from government health programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
security and privacy of patient information 
federal  state and local laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures 
united states regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
similarly  laws in non us jurisdictions may have similar or even stricter requirements related to the treatment of patient information 
in the united states  hipaa regulations require national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
covered entities under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which include healthcare organizations such as our clients  our employer clinic business model and our claims transmission services  are required to comply with the privacy standards  the transaction regulations and the security regulations 
moreover  the recently enacted health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and associated regulatory requirements  extend many of the hipaa obligations  formerly imposed only upon covered entities  to business associates as well 
as a business associate of our clients who are covered entities  we were in most instances already contractually required to ensure compliance with the hipaa regulations as they pertain to handling of covered client data 
however  the extension of these hipaa obligations to business associates by law has created additional liability risks related to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
evolving hipaa and hitech related laws or regulations and regulations in non us jurisdictions could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they are not re designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new interpretations or regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients to execute new or modified healthcare transactions 
we may need to expend additional capital  software development and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these evolving data security and privacy issues 
furthermore  our failure to maintain confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements could damage our reputation and expose us to breach of contract claims although we contractually limit liability  when possible and where permitted  fines and penalties 
if we are unable to generate sufficient demand for our current telehealth product and services  we may not be able to recover our inventory and other investments 
further  modifications to our current telehealth product may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained 
in connection with our manufacturing and sales plans for the expressmd solutions telehealth service  we have purchased certain components and contract manufacturing services for the production of the monitoring appliance 
our ability to recover our investment in this venture  including in building inventories of our current telehealth products is subject to risks 
if we are unable to generate sufficient demand for this product  we may not be able to recover our costs in acquiring these assets 
as of june   total inventory was valued at approximately million and we had prepaid inventory investments of approximately million that are included in other current assets 

table of contents further  any modification to an fda cleared medical device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use  requires a new fda k clearance or  possibly  a premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new k clearance or premarket approval  but the fda may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer 
in the future  we may make modifications to our telehealth products and  in appropriate circumstances  determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary 
regulatory authorities may disagree with our decisions not to seek new clearance or approval and may require us to obtain clearance or approval for modifications to our products 
if that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the necessary clearance or approval 
under these circumstances  we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties 
if any of the foregoing were to occur  we may be unable to recover the cost of our investments in our telehealth business and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
if our suppliers for our telehealth product fails to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  and other applicable post market requirements  our manufacturing operations could be disrupted  our product sales and profitability could suffer  and we may be subject to a wide variety of fda enforcement actions 
after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
we are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the fda to determine our compliance with all regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in the fda or a court instituting a wide variety of enforcement actions against us  including a public warning letter  a recall of products  fines or civil penalties  seizure or detention of our products  withdrawing k clearance already granted to us  and criminal prosecution 
the manufacturing processes of some of our suppliers must comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which governs the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  testing  manufacture  control  quality assurance  installation  servicing  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of medical devices 
the fda enforces the qsr through unannounced inspections 
if one of our suppliers fails a qsr inspection  or if a corrective action plan adopted by a supplier is not sufficient  the fda may bring an enforcement action  and our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed 
we are also subject to the fda s general prohibition against promoting our products for unapproved or off label uses  the fda s adverse event reporting requirements and the fda s reporting requirements for field correction or product removals 
the fda has recently placed increased emphasis on its scrutiny of compliance with the qsr and these other post market requirements 
if we or one of our suppliers violate the fda s requirements or fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any significant compliance issue raised by the fda  the fda can take various enforcement actions which could cause our product sales and profitability to suffer 
our hosted software and web based services and other product offerings may not be accepted by the market  which would seriously harm our business 
demand and market acceptance for our currently available hosted software and web based services and other product offerings remain subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving widespread acceptance of these or future offerings will continue to require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to create and maintain brand recognition and customer demand for such offerings 
demand for our software  services and other product offerings depends on  among other things the perceived ability of our offerings to address real customer problems  the perceived quality  price  ease of use and interoperability of our offerings as compared to our competitors offerings  the market s perception of the ease or difficulty in deploying our software or services  especially in complex network environments  the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of conducting business  
table of contents market acceptance and use of new technologies and standards  the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the pace of technological change and our ability to keep up with these changes  and general economic conditions  which influence how much money our customers and potential customers are willing to allocate to their information technology budgets 
there can be no assurance that adequate marketing arrangements will be made and continued for our products and services and there can be no assurance that any of these offerings will ever achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance or that such offerings will be profitable 
if we cannot continuously enhance our hosted software and web based service offerings in response to rapid changes in the market  our business will be harmed 
the software based services industry and computer industry are characterized by extensive research and development efforts which result in the frequent introduction of new products and services which render existing products and services obsolete 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a technically competent research and development staff and our ability to adapt to technological changes in the industry and enhance and improve our hosted software and web based service offerings and successfully develop and market new offerings that meet the changing needs of our customers 
although we are dedicated to continued improvement of our offerings with a view towards satisfying market needs with the most advanced capabilities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so on a regular basis and remain competitive with products offered by other manufacturers 
at the present time  we do not have a targeted level of expenditures for research and development 
we will evaluate all opportunities but believe the majority of our research and development will be devoted to enhancements of our existing offerings 
if our hosted software and web based service offerings are not competitive  our business will suffer 
we are engaged in the highly competitive businesses of developing hosted software and web based workflow management services and telehealth solutions 
these markets are continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our markets include performance  ease of use  quality reliability of our offerings  scalability  features and functionality  price and customer service and support 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully incorporate these factors into our software and web based services and compete against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure we face will not harm our business 
if we are unable to develop and market products to compete with the products of competitors  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business  including inscrybe healthcare and our telehealth appliance and service and our electronic signing solutions are relatively new business lines and although the level of competition for these offerings is uncertain at this point in time  the field of software based solutions in which we compete is highly competitive 
there can be no assurances  however  that any of our offerings will achieve market acceptance 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidations and the formation of new companies with new  innovative offerings 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their software and service offerings to address the needs of our prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our hosted software and web based services are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
our hosted software and web based services are complex and may contain undetected errors  failures or bugs that may arise when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
these offerings may be used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our offerings or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in such offerings 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial use 
errors  failures or bugs in our offerings could result in negative publicity  returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our hosted software or web based services or claims by customers or others 
alleviating these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our licenses which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and would adversely affect our financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
we have a significant amount of net operating loss carry forwards which we may not be able to utilize in certain circumstances 
at june   we had net operating loss  or nol  carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  available to offset future taxable income 
under section of the internal revenue code  following an ownership change  special limitations apply to the use by a loss corporation of its i nol carry forwards arising before the ownership change and ii net unrealized built in losses if such losses existed immediately before the ownership change and exceed a statutory threshold amount recognized during the five years following the ownership change i and ii are referred to collectively as the applicable tax attributes 
after an ownership change  the amount of the loss corporation s taxable income for each post change taxable year that may be offset by the applicable tax attributes is limited to the product of the long term tax exempt rate published by the irs for the month of the ownership change multiplied by the value of the loss corporation s stock the section limitation 
to the extent that the loss corporation s section limitation in a given taxable year exceeds its taxable income for the year  that excess increases the section limitation in future taxable years 
risks related to our common stock our stock price is volatile and could decline 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
after giving effect to our reverse stock split  our stock price during the fiscal year ended june  traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
we cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements we make regarding significant contracts  acquisitions  dispositions  or strategic partnerships  additions or departures of key personnel  the introduction of competitive offerings by existing or new competitors  uncertainty about and customer confidence in the current economic conditions and outlook  reduced demand for any given product on web based service offering  and sales of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  including companies whose stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we were not in compliance with the nasdaq capital market minimum bid price requirement and failure to maintain compliance with this standard could result in delisting and adversely affect the market price and liquidity of our common stock 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol adat 
if we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
these continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria  such as a minimum closing bid price 
on september   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market advising that the company did not meet the minimum per share bid price requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market pursuant to nasdaq marketplace listing rule a and on march   nasdaq notified us that it had granted us an additional days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of listing rule a 
to demonstrate compliance with this requirement  the closing bid price of our common stock needed to be at least per share for a minimum of consecutive business days before september  in order to satisfy this requirement  on august   we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to implement a one for two reverse split of our common stock and our common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on august  on september   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
although we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain continued compliance with this rule or the other listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market 
if we were unable to meet these requirements  we would receive another delisting notice from the nasdaq capital market for failure to comply with one or more of the continued listing requirements 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq capital market  trading of our common stock most likely will be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the otc bulletin board 
such trading will reduce the market liquidity of our common stock 
as a result  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market and the trading price remains below per share  trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the exchange act  which require additional disclosure by broker dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally  any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on nasdaq that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low priced stocks to their clients 
moreover  various regulations and policies restrict the ability of shareholders to borrow against or margin low priced stocks  and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls 
additionally  because brokers commissions on low priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks  the current price of the common stock can result in an individual shareholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher 
this factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock 
finally  the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by these requirements could discourage broker dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock 

table of contents the holders of the senior secured notes issued in our bridge financings have a first priority security interest in all of our assets and these notes include customary covenants regarding our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
if we are required to repay these securities on their scheduled due date  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
on march  and september   we consummated the sales of an aggregate principal amount of  of senior secured promissory notes and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock to certain accredited investors in a private placement under the securities act 
in addition  we issued  warrants to the holders of the senior secured notes issued in march in consideration of the extension of the maturity date of such notes to october  the secured notes are senior secured promissory notes and are not convertible into our equity securities and are due and payable on the first to occur of october  or the consummation of a subsequent financing as defined 
the secured notes are secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets in accordance with  and subject to  a security agreement between us and the investors 
if we are unable to consummate a subsequent financing  we will be required to repay the secured notes on their scheduled maturity date  which may have an adverse effect on our cash position 
among the investors that purchased secured notes from us in one or both of these transactions were three members of our board of directors  mr 
j 
david luce  mr 
john j 
waters  and mr 
o connell benjamin  who is also our chief executive officer  as well as mr 
william marshall  our chief financial officer 
in addition  our largest stockholder  lazarus investment partners  lllp  participated in these transactions and the manager of the general partner of lazarus investment partners  lllp  is the brother of dr 
todd a 
borus  a member of our board of directors 
the secured notes contain covenants and events of default customary for similar transactions 
accordingly  without the consent of the holders of a majority in interest of the secured notes  we must comply with certain restrictions against incurring additional indebtedness and granting additional security interests on our assets 
among the defined events of default are defaults of our payment obligations  breach of any material covenant or representation of the secured note or the related transaction agreements  and the commencement of proceedings under applicable us federal or state bankruptcy  insolvency  reorganization or other similar laws either against us or by us 
if we are unable to repay the secured notes when due  or upon an event of default  the holders could foreclose on our assets since we have not paid dividends on our common stock  you may not receive income from this investment 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of our business 
trading in our stock over the last twelve months has been limited  so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock for the twelve months ended june  was approximately  shares 
if limited trading in our stock continues  it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices 
moreover  the market price for shares of our common stock may be made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock 
when trading volume is low  significant price movement can be caused by the trading in a relatively small number of shares 
volatility in our common stock could cause stockholders to incur substantial losses 
additional financings could result in dilution to existing stockholders and otherwise adversely impact the rights of our common stockholders 
additional financings that we may require in the future will dilute the percentage ownership interests of our stockholders and may adversely affect our earnings and net book value per share 
in addition  we may not be able to secure any such additional financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we have the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock  as well as additional classes or series of warrants or debt 
table of contents obligations which may be convertible into any one or more classes or series of ownership interests 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
subject to compliance with the requirements of the nasdaq stock market  such securities may be issued without the approval or other consent of our stockholders 
we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission in august  which was declared effective by the commission on september  under this registration statement  we may sell  from time to time in one or more public offerings  shares of our common stock  shares of our preferred stock  debt securities or warrants to purchase common stock  preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities 
after giving effect to our registered direct offering completed in october  there is approximately million available for future issuances under this registration statement  subject to sec limitations 
we have also filed a shelf registration statement on from s with the securities and exchange commission in august which would replace the september shelf registration statement if and when it is declared effective 
this latter registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the commission 
this disclosure shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities  nor shall there by any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction 
any offer of the securities will be solely by means of the prospectus included in the registration statement and one or more prospectus supplements that will be issued at the time of the offering 
in the event that any future financing should be in the form of  be convertible into or exchangeable for  equity securities  and upon the conversion or exercise of such securities  investors may experience additional dilution 
moreover  we may issue undesignated shares of preferred stock  the terms of which may be fixed by our board of directors and which terms may be preferential to the interests of our common stockholders 
we have issued preferred stock in the past  and our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to create and issue one or more additional series of such preferred stock and to determine the voting  dividend and other rights of holders of such preferred stock 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business 
the issuance of any of such series of preferred stock or debt securities may have an adverse effect on the holders of common stock 
if we are required to redeem the shares of our series c preferred stock  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
in connection with our october private placement  we filed with the secretary of state of delaware a certificate of designations  preferences and rights and number of shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock  or the series c designation 
as amended on april   the series c designation provides for the mandatory redemption of all outstanding shares of series c preferred stock upon their stated maturity date on april   which is the month anniversary of the original issue date  unless prior to such date  our shareholders approve the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
if we are required to redeem the shares of series c preferred stock  we will be required to pay to the holders of the shares of series c preferred stock a total redemption price equal to of the stated value of the series c shares  plus dividends  which would amount to  following our recent annual meeting of shareholders held on june   our shareholders have declined to approve the conversion of the series c preferred stock on five occasions 
consistent with our obligations under the purchase agreement entered into with the purchasers of the series c preferred stock  we will call additional meetings of our shareholders at which shareholders will again be requested to approve the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock 
in addition  if at the maturity date of the series c preferred stock  any shares of our series b preferred stock remain outstanding  we will be required to redeem all such outstanding shares of series b preferred stock immediately prior to the redemption of the series c preferred stock 
there are currently  shares of series b preferred stock outstanding and the total redemption payment for the series b preferred stock is equal to  plus any accrued  but unpaid dividends thereon as of such redemption date 
accordingly  the redemption of these securities may have an adverse effect on our cash position 

table of contents the number of shares of our common stock outstanding has increased substantially as a result of our recent financings  and the exercise or conversion of the warrants and shares of preferred stock issued in these transactions could result in further dilution to holders of our common stock 
upon the closing of our october private placement  we issued to a group of institutional and other accredited investors a total of  shares of our common stock  plus  shares of series c preferred stock  which  as amended  are convertible into an maximum of  shares of common stock at the initial conversion price of including all shares issuable in lieu of cash dividends for the month term and common stock warrants to purchase a total of  additional shares of common stock 
in addition  in connection with the registered direct offering of common stock and warrants we announced on october   we sold an additional  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the issuance of these securities resulted in substantial dilution to stockholders who held our common stock prior to such transactions 
for example  the shares issued in our financing represented approximately of our outstanding common stock after the offering  without giving effect to the exercise of the warrants 
further  the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock and exercise of warrants issued in the private placement may result in further dilution to the holders of our common stock 
as of june   the number of shares issued to the purchasers in this private placement and warrants exercised to date represents approximately of our outstanding common stock  without giving effect to the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock or the exercise of the outstanding common stock warrants 
in addition  in connection with the amendments to the series c preferred stock to extend the maturity date to april  and increase the dividend rate to for the extension period  the company issued the holders of the series c preferred stock warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and in connection with the senior secured promissory note transactions in march and september  the company issued the note holders warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock is subject to the approval of our stockholders in accordance with applicable nasdaq requirements and under the purchase agreement with the investors  we are obligated to seek stockholder approval for the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock 
as mentioned above  our stockholders have not approved such conversion 
these stockholders  if acting together  may have significant influence over the outcome of any stockholder vote  other than any proposal to approve the conversion of such shares  including the election of directors and other significant business matters that require stockholder approval 
such other significant business matters could include  for example  the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the sale of these shares of common stock and any conversion of the shares of preferred stock and exercise of warrants subject to stockholder approval  as discussed above may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially 
the exercise of our outstanding options and warrants  or conversion of our outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock  may depress our stock price and dilute your ownership of the company 
as of june   the following options and warrants were outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  not all of which are immediately exercisable 
the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is per share 
these stock options are employee and non executive director options 
warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in addition  there are currently outstanding  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and  shares of our series c preferred stock 
the holder of the series b convertible preferred stock may convert these shares into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to per share 
accordingly  the outstanding  shares of series b convertible preferred stock are presently convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  which will be available for immediate resale in accordance with the provisions of rule under the securities act 
further  as described above  the shares of series c preferred 
table of contents stock and all accrued dividends thereon will convert into a maximum of  shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of  effective upon the approval of our stockholders 
if our stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock  then all shares of series c preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of our common stock 
to the extent that these securities are exercised or converted  dilution to our stockholders will occur 
moreover  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected  since the holders of these securities can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than the exercise and conversion terms provided by those securities 
further  in the event the conversion price of our outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock is lower than the actual trading price on the day of conversion  the holders could immediately sell their converted common shares  which would have a dilutive effect on the value of the outstanding common shares 
furthermore  the significant downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock as preferred stock holders converted these securities and sell the common shares received on conversion could encourage short sales by the holders of preferred stock or other stockholders 
this would place further downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
even the mere perception of eventual sales of common shares issued on the conversion of the shares of preferred stock could lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and advance notice provisions in connection with stockholder proposals that may prevent or hinder any attempt by our stockholders to bring business to be considered by our stockholders at a meeting or replace our board of directors 
together these provisions may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  adversely affecting the market price of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview authentidate holding corp 
authentidate or the company is a provider of secure web based software applications and telehealth products and services that enable healthcare organizations to coordinate care for patients and enhance related administrative and clinical workflows 
authentidate and its subsidiaries provide products and services that address a variety of business needs for our customers  including enabling healthcare organizations to increase revenues  improve productivity  enhance patient care and reduce costs by eliminating paper and manual work steps from clinical  administrative and other processes and enhancing compliance with regulatory requirements 
our web based services are delivered as software as a service saas to our customers interfacing seamlessly with billing and document management systems 
these solutions incorporate multiple features and security technologies such as rules based electronic forms  intelligent routing  transaction management  electronic signatures  identity credentialing  content authentication  automated audit trails and remote patient monitoring capabilities 
both web and fax based communications are integrated into automated  secure and trusted workflow solutions 
our telehealth solutions provide in home patient vital signs monitoring systems and services to improve care for patients with chronic illnesses and reduce the cost of care by delivering results to their healthcare providers via the internet 
our telehealth solutions combine our electronic house call patient vital signs monitoring appliances or our interactive voice response patient vital signs monitoring solution with a web based management and monitoring software module based on our inscrybe healthcare platform 
both solutions enable unattended measurements of patients vital signs and related health information and are designed to aid wellness and preventative care  and deliver better care to specific patient segments who require regular monitoring of medical conditions 
healthcare providers can easily view each specific patient s vital statistics and make adjustments to the patient s care plans securely via the internet 
this service provides a combination of care plan schedule reminders and comprehensive disease management education as well as intelligent routing to alert on duty caregivers whenever a patient s vital signs are outside of the practitioner s pre set ranges 
healthcare providers and health insurers are also expected to benefit by having additional tools to improve patient care  and reduce overall in person and emergency room patient visits 
authentidate currently operates its business in the united states with technology and service offerings that address emerging growth opportunities based on the regulatory and legal requirements specific to each market 
the business is engaged in the development and sale of web based services largely based on our inscrybe platform and related capabilities and telehealth services featuring our electronic house call and interactive voice response products 
in recent years we have focused our efforts on developing and introducing solutions for use in the healthcare information technology industry 
we believe there are several factors that will be favorable for the healthcare information technology industry in the near future  despite lingering weakness in the global economy 
because healthcare information technology solutions play an important role in healthcare by improving safety  efficiency and reducing cost  they are often viewed as more strategic than other capital purchases 
most united states healthcare providers also recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet regulatory  compliance and government reimbursement requirements and incentive opportunities 
in addition  government agencies  as well as politicians and policymakers appear to agree that the growing cost of our healthcare system is unsustainable 
leaders of both political parties recognize that the intelligent use of information systems will improve health outcomes and  correspondingly  drive down costs 
the broad recognition that healthcare information technology is essential to help control healthcare costs and improve quality contributed to the inclusion of healthcare information technology incentives in the american recovery and reinvestment act arra 
the arra and accompanying health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech provisions include more than billion in incentives for healthcare organizations to modernize operations through meaningful use of healthcare information technology 
we believe that these incentives are contributing to increased demand for healthcare information technology solutions and services in the united states 

table of contents another element in the united states marketplace is ongoing healthcare reform which we believe could drive insurance coverage to an estimated million additional consumers and may have many second order effects on our customers 
for example  healthcare providers may face increased volumes that could create capacity constraints  and they may find it challenging to profitably provide care at the planned reimbursement rates under the expanded coverage models 
we also expect additional compliance and reporting challenges for our customers in the areas of pay for quality  coding requirements  and waste  fraud and abuse measures 
we believe the above factors create strong incentives for providers to maximize efficiency and create the need for additional investments in healthcare information technology solutions and services 
thus  while the current economic environment has impacted our business  we believe the fundamental value proposition of healthcare information technology remains strong and that the healthcare information technology industry will likely benefit as healthcare providers and governments continue to recognize that these solutions and services contribute to safer  more efficient healthcare 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flow from operating activities while we have been focused on developing new products and services  hiring management  refining our business strategies and repositioning our businesses for growth 
although we believe we are well positioned for such growth  we expect to continue to generate net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we seek to expand our potential markets and generate increased revenues 
as discussed in more detail below  we have completed several financing transactions  and sold non core assets to fund our working capital needs 
see liquidity and capital resources 
as discussed in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on november  we completed a definitive joint venture termination agreement with our joint venture partner  encountercare solutions  inc seller  whereby our joint venture relationship was terminated and expressmd solutions became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
we also entered into a worldwide  perpetual  irrevocable  royalty free  non exclusive license to use the intellectual property of the seller and an affiliated company to continue to commercialize and develop our expressmd telehealth products and services 
in connection with these transactions we agreed to pay the seller million in cash of which million was paid through closing  million was paid in april and million is due on october   net of any amounts offset in connection with the litigation discussed in item legal proceedings 
we also issued  shares of our common stock to the seller 
the company paid the cash consideration from cash on hand and issued the shares of common stock out of its authorized but unissued shares 
during fiscal we have continued to take steps to refine our core product and service offerings  significantly expand our addressable markets  manage operating costs and position the company for long term growth 
we are focused on refining and marketing our inscrybe healthcare referral management and hospital discharge solutions and our telehealth products and services 
as discussed above  we believe our business will benefit as the federal government healthcare reforms are implemented and as trends in the us healthcare industry to significantly reduce costs  shorten the length of hospital stays  reduce hospital readmissions  shift patient care towards wellness and preventative care programs and automate healthcare records and processes take hold 
although we have taken steps to focus our business in these areas  our progress will be impacted by the timing of customer contracts and implementations and the market acceptance of our products and services 
during this period we have also advanced the development of our telehealth service offerings and continued to refine the capabilities of our electronic house call and interactive voice response products and services 
in april  we announced that we had been selected as a supplier to the department of veterans affairs va for its core coordination home telehealth program and in april we announced that the va had exercised its first one year option to extend the term of our contract  which also includes three additional one year extension options 
in july  the va successfully completed the required test in phase for our electronic house call vital signs monitoring device and web service and we received approval to begin the national rollout of this solution to va facilities throughout the us and its territories 
during the contract period  the company will be committed to provide  subject to purchase orders from the va telehealth devices and certain associated software solutions 
we believe that the va telehealth project positions the company for success as this market develops in the commercial sector and provides a significant growth opportunity for the company as we work to support the 
table of contents va in its efforts to deliver quality care to our veterans 
there can be no assurance that the va will exercise any of the other option periods under the agreement nor can the company provide any assurances as to the actual amount of products and solutions  if any  that may ultimately be purchased by va facilities under the agreement 
our current revenues consist principally of transaction fees for web based hosted software services 
from our telehealth business we generate revenues from hardware sales  monthly monitoring services and maintenance fees 
growth in our business is affected by a number of factors  including general economic and business conditions  and is characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of customer contracts  implementations and ramp up to full utilization can have a significant impact on results and we believe our results over a longer period of time provide better visibility into our performance 
we intend to continue our efforts to market our web based services and related products in our target markets 
we also intend to focus on identifying additional applications and markets where our technology can address customer needs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact our financial statements 
we believe that the policies described below represent our critical accounting policies  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  you should also review our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page f of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  software development costs  patent costs  trademarks and licenses are reviewed for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow approach whenever events or changes in circumstances such as significant changes in the business climate  changes in product offerings  or other circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
software development costs software development and modification costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized based on anticipated revenue for the related product with an annual minimum equal to the straight line amortization over the remaining economic life of the related product generally three years 
amortization expense is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from web based hosted software services  telehealth products and post contract customer support services 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has 
table of contents occurred  the selling price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period over which the last undelivered element is delivered  which is typically the life of the contract agreement 
if these criteria are met  we allocate total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately which is referred to as vendor specific objective evidence or vsoe 
revenue from web based hosted software and related services and post contract customer support services is recognized when the related service is provided and  when required  accepted by the customer 
revenue from telehealth products is recognized when such products are delivered 
revenue from multiple element arrangements that cannot be allocated to identifiable items is recognized ratably over the contract term which is generally one year 
management estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
examples include estimates of loss contingencies and product life cycles  assumptions such as elements comprising a software arrangement  including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products  when technological feasibility is achieved for our products  the potential outcome of future tax consequences  and determining when investment or other impairments exist 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we make estimates on the future recoverability of capitalized amounts  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized and we make assumptions in connection with the calculations of share based compensation expense 
actual results and outcomes may differ from management s estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
share based compensation share based employee compensation expense is determined using the black scholes option pricing model which values options based on the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price of the option  the expected life of the option  the estimated volatility  expected dividend payments and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the options 

table of contents the company computed the estimated fair values of all share based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and the assumptions set forth in the following table 
the company based its estimate of the life of these options on historical averages over the past five years and estimates of expected future behavior 
the expected volatility was based on the company s historical stock volatility 
the assumptions used in the company s black scholes calculations for fiscal  and are as follows risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility factor weighted average expected option life months fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because the company s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of share based compensation for employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation as circumstances change and additional data becomes available over time  which may result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies 
such changes could materially impact the company s fair value determination 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments which subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
to reduce credit risk  we place our cash  cash equivalents and investments with several high credit quality financial institutions and typically invest in aa or better rated investments 
we monitor our credit customers and we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
reverse stock split on august   we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to implement a one for two reverse split of our outstanding common stock and our common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on august  as a result of the reverse stock split  each two shares of our outstanding common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of common stock

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues were  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year period

the increase for the current year is due primarily to higher personnel and stock option expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year period 
this change is due primarily to higher expenses for fixed assets and acquired licenses partly offset by a decrease in amortization of capitalized software 
other expense was  for the year ended june  compared to other income of  for the prior year period

in december  a special meeting of stockholders  our stockholders approved an amendment to our amended certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized shares of common stock from  to  in order to provide us greater flexibility in considering our potential business needs 
on april   at a special meeting of our stockholders the company s stockholders approved an amendment to the company s certificate of incorporation by an amendment to the company s certificate of designations  preferences and rights and number of shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock to extend the maturity date and increase the dividend rate of the series c preferred stock for the extension period

cash flows at june   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to approximately  and total assets at that date were  since june  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by approximately  reflecting the issuance of company securities offset by cash used principally to fund operating losses  product development activities  the business acquisition discussed above  changes in working capital and capital expenditures during the year ended june  cash used for the period includes investments in data center and related infrastructure equipment of approximately  the prepayment of certain inventory investments of approximately  which is included in other current 
table of contents assets  the prepayment of certain insurance premiums and maintenance contracts and the aforementioned business acquisition 
we expect to continue to use cash to fund operating losses  product development activities  joint venture investments and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
net cash used by operating activities for the year ended june  was approximately  compared to  for the prior year period 
net cash used by investing activities  excluding purchases and sales of marketable securities  was  for the year ended june  compared to cash provided of  for the prior year period 
this change primarily reflects the business acquisition and asset purchases discussed above for the current period compared to net proceeds from the sale of non core assets discussed above 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was approximately  compared to  for the prior year period 
these amounts reflect net proceeds from the registered direct offering and secured note transaction in fiscal and the private placement transaction in fiscal discussed above  less preferred stock dividends 
cash flows from discontinued operations were not significant for the prior year periods 
net proceeds from the sale of these operations and related items amounted to approximately  and are included in investing activities for discontinued operations 
to date we have been largely dependent on our ability to sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities to obtain financing to fund our operating deficits  product development activities  business acquisitions  capital expenditures and telehealth activities 
under our current operating plan to grow our business  our ability to improve operating cash flow has been highly dependent on the market acceptance of our offerings 
as mentioned in the overview section  we believe that the company will benefit from the federal government healthcare reforms and industry trends focused on automation and cost reduction 
based on our business plan  we expect our existing resources  proceeds from the million senior note transaction completed in september  revenues generated from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of outstanding warrants of which there can be no assurance to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  these resources may not be sufficient if we are required to redeem our outstanding shares of series b and series c preferred stock within the next months 
if we are required to redeem these securities within the next months we may need to renegotiate the terms of such securities to enable us to manage our cash resources 
no assurances can be given  however  that we will be able to attain sales levels and support our costs through revenues derived from operations  generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our other obligations or successfully modify the terms of our preferred securities  or that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
if our available cash resources and projected revenue levels are not sufficient to sustain our operations  or otherwise meet our cash needs  we will need to raise additional capital to fund operations and to meet our obligations in the future 
to meet our financing requirements  we may raise funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic alliances 
raising additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities may cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution in their ownership interests and new investors may have rights superior to the rights of our other stockholders 
raising additional funds through debt financing  if available  may involve covenants that restrict our business activities and options 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in raising additional capital  or securing financing when needed or on terms satisfactory to the company 
if we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital we will need to reduce costs and operations substantially 
any inability to obtain required financing on sufficiently favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including our relationships with suppliers and customers  the market acceptance of our software and services  
table of contents the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new offerings and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  price discounts on our products and services to our customers  our pursuit of strategic transactions  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the level of accounts receivable and inventories that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our potential need to redeem our outstanding shares of preferred stock and repay our outstanding secured notes  and our competitors response to our offerings 
financing activities except as discussed above  we have not engaged in any external financing activities in fiscal and other matters the events and contingencies described below have impacted or may impact our liquidity and capital resources 
presently   shares of our series b preferred stock  originally issued in a private financing in october  remain outstanding 
as of october   our right to redeem these shares of series b preferred stock is vested 
accordingly  we have the right to repurchase such shares at a redemption price equal to per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the holder  however  has the right to convert these shares of preferred stock into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of 
in the event we elect to redeem these securities  the holder will be able to exercise its conversion right subsequent to the date that we issue a notice of redemption but prior to the deemed redemption date as would be set forth in such notice 
as of june   no shares of the series b preferred stock have been redeemed 
in connection with our private placement of securities in october  we issued  shares of series c convertible redeemable preferred stock the series c preferred stock 
at our special meeting of stockholders held on april   our stockholders approved an amendment to the series c designation to extend the maturity date and increase the dividend rate of the series c preferred stock  and also approved the issuance of  warrants to the holder of the series c preferred stock 
the series c designation  as amended  provides for the mandatory redemption of all outstanding shares of series c preferred stock upon their stated maturity date of april   the month anniversary of the original issue date  unless prior to such date  our stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of series c preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
if we are required to redeem the shares of series c preferred stock  we will be required to pay to the holders of the shares of series c preferred stock a total redemption price equal to of the stated value of the series c shares  plus dividends  which would amount to  in addition  if at the maturity date of the series c preferred stock  any shares of our series b preferred stock remain outstanding  we will be required to redeem all such outstanding shares of series b preferred stock immediately prior to the redemption of the series c preferred stock 
there are currently  shares of series b preferred stock outstanding and the total redemption payment for the series b preferred stock is equal to  plus any accrued  but unpaid dividends thereon as of such redemption date 
as discussed above  the company also has  of senior secured 
table of contents promissory notes that mature on october  accordingly  the redemption of these securities may have an adverse effect on our cash position 
to date  our stockholders have not approved the conversion of the series c preferred stock 
as described above  if necessary the company will seek to modify the terms of secured notes and the series c preferred shares so that the company would not be required to redeem such securities on their scheduled maturity dates 
however  no assurances can be given we will be able to modify the terms of these securities 
commitments office lease commitments we entered into the lease agreement for our executive offices on july  the lease was for a term of ten years and four months  with a commencement date of october  and covers approximately  total rentable square feet 
the annual rent in the first year was  increasing to  in year and increasing at regular intervals until year when the annual rent will be approximately  effective february   we amended our lease to reduce the annual rent to approximately  for the remaining lease term and extended the lease term for one year through january the lease also provides us with a one time option to renew the lease for a term of five years at the then current market rate 
as part of the lease agreement  we posted a letter of credit securing our lease payments which was reduced to approximately  contractual commitments a summary of the contractual commitments associated with our lease obligations as of june  is as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years total operating leases on june   we entered into agreements with each of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in order to continue the compensation modification program implemented in february pursuant to these agreements  both officers agreed to continue the reduction in their base salary to of their original base salary until such time as the company achieves cash flow breakeven as measured through the fiscal quarter ending september  pursuant to these continuation agreements  the term cash flow breakeven was modified from the definition adopted when we originally implement this program and is now defined to mean that the company has achieved positive cash flow from operations for two consecutive fiscal quarters ending no later than the end of the fiscal quarter ending september   determined by reference to the revenues and other amounts received by the company from its operations 
the term cash flow from operations  however  shall not include a amounts received from the sale  lease or disposition of i fixed or capital assets  except for amounts received in the ordinary course of business  or ii any subsidiary company  b capital expenditures  c interest income and expense  and d other non operating items as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as consistently applied during the periods involved 
in consideration for these agreements  we granted these officers options to purchase such number of shares of common stock as is equal to of their base salary payable for the period commencing february  and expiring on september  accordingly  we granted our chief executive officer  options and granted our chief financial officer  options 
the options were granted under the company s omnibus equity incentive plan  are exercisable for a period of years at a per share exercise price of and shall only vest and become exercisable upon either the date determined that the company achieves cash flow breakeven  as defined above  or in the event of a termination of employment either without cause or for good reason  as such terms were defined in the employment agreements we previously entered with each such officer 
further  in connection with the continuation of the above referenced compensation modification program  other employees of the company were granted options to purchase shares of common stock under the company s 
table of contents omnibus equity incentive plan in consideration for the continued salary reduction 
under this program  the company reduced the salaries of non executive employees earning  per annum or less by and reduced the salaries of its other non executive employees in the program by and in consideration for such modification  awarded these employees options to purchase such number of shares of common stock as is equal to the foregone salary as measured over the period commencing february  and expiring on september  accordingly  we granted our non executive employees a total of  options 
under this program  employees base salary will revert to its prior level upon the company s achievement of cash flow breakeven  as defined above  or if otherwise specified by the board of directors to be earlier 
the options awarded to non executive employees will vest on the date that the company achieves cash flow breakeven  as defined above  and shall have the same exercise price and expiration date as the options granted to our executives 
in addition  in connection with the foregoing  we also amended the vesting for the options granted in february and to our employees  including executive officers  when we first implemented the compensation modification program 
the amendment provides that the measurement period to determine whether the vesting criteria of achieving cash flow from operations has been satisfied shall expire at the end of the fiscal quarter ending september  off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
we have entered into various agreements by which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the indemnified party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as intellectual property rights 
payments by us under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned on the other party making a claim 
such claims are generally subject to challenge by us and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  we have not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of june   we were not aware of any obligations under such indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
effects of inflation and changing prices the impact of general inflation on our operations has not been significant to date and we believe inflation will continue to have an insignificant impact on us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have approximately  invested in short term investments as of june  we are not exposed to significant financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are only minimally impacted by changes in interest rates 
however  in the future  we may enter into transactions denominated in non us currencies or increase the level of our borrowings  which could increase our exposure to these market risks 
we have not used  and currently do not contemplate using  any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and marketable securities 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at june   our unrestricted cash and marketable securities  totaled approximately  of which approximately  was invested in money market investments 
the remainder of our cash was in non interest bearing checking accounts used to pay operating expenses
