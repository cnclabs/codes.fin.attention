additionally  absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research  and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 
our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases  such as cancer  diabetes  and multiple sclerosis 
specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring 
we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors 
however  we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 
other other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the recently acquired world courier group  inc world courier operating segment 
the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure  and  therefore  have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 
abcs  through a number of operating businesses  provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs  outcomes research  contract field staffing  patient assistance and copay assistance programs  adherence programs  risk mitigation services  and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers

table of contents results of operations year ended september  compared with year ended september  revenue fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other intersegment eliminations revenue revenue of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year as abdc s revenue declined  and was partially offset by the revenue increase of absg 
additionally  our recent acquisitions  with theracom and world courier being the largest contributors  added to our revenue growth in the fiscal year ended september  we currently expect our revenue in fiscal to increase between and 
our expected growth rate reflects our new three year contract with express scripts  inc express scripts that is effective as of october   to supply primarily brand name pharmaceuticals 
annual sales to express scripts in fiscal under this contract are estimated to be billion 
in early april  our largest customer  medco health solutions  inc medco  merged with express scripts  which is the surviving corporation 
medco accounted for of our revenue in fiscal in addition  fiscal will include a full year s operating results of our fiscal acquisitions of theracom and world courier 
our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends  including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers  general economic conditions in the united states  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers  and changes in federal government rules and regulations 
pharmaceutical distribution segment abdc s revenue decreased from the prior fiscal year 
the decline in abdc s revenue was primarily due to the increase in use of lower priced generics  a reduction in chain customer revenue primarily due to the previously announced loss of one of our larger retail customers  the former long s drugs  which was acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract prior to september   and lower sales to its largest customer 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in brand name pharmaceutical prices 
absg s revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in its third party logistics business and growth in its vaccine and physician office distribution business  which has benefited from sales of a new ophthalmology drug 
absg s revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of certain specialty oncology drugs 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues 
during fiscal  of pharmaceutical distribution revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in fiscal of institutional and retail 
sales to institutional customers remained flat in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers decreased from the prior fiscal year 
other other revenue increased  million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the million contribution from our theracom and world courier acquisitions 
gross profit fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change gross profit 
table of contents gross profit in fiscal increased million from the prior fiscal year due to the contributions made by our recent acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom  the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs  and brand price increases  all of which were offset  in part  by the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs  and by competitive pressures on customer margins 
as expected  in fiscal  the gross profit contributions from the sales of oxaliplatin  gemcitabine  and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were approximately million lower than the prior fiscal year 
we had no sales of oxaliplatin in our current fiscal year until mid august and  therefore  gross profit on the sale of oxaliplatin was significantly lower than in fiscal in fiscal  the gross profit decline from the above mentioned three specialty generic drugs was partially offset by the gross profit contribution from over abdc brand to generic product conversions 
in the current fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this compared to a recognized gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year 
these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
we are unable to estimate future gains  if any  that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in fiscal  our gross profit was impacted by a non recurring million benefit in connection with a customer being acquired by a third party 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin of in fiscal increased basis points from the prior fiscal year 
the gross profit margin increase was due to the gross profit contributions of our recent acquisitions  primarily world courier and theracom  and the solid growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs  both of which were offset by the decline in gross profit relating to the above mentioned specialty oncology generic drugs 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  contributed basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our lifo charge in fiscal was lower than the prior fiscal year charge due to higher brand inventory sales prior to the end of our fiscal year 
operating expenses fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change distribution  selling and administrative depreciation and amortization employee severance  litigation and other intangible asset impairments total operating expenses distribution  selling and administrative expense in fiscal increased due to the operating costs of our recently acquired companies and was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses within our pharmaceutical distribution segment and a decrease in our bad debt expense 
depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system 
amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the theracom and world courier acquisitions 
in fiscal  we introduced a number of initiatives  some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation  to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions 
in connection with these initiatives  we recorded million of severance and other related costs and through september   employees have been severed 
other costs include an estimated million liability to exit our participation in a multi employer pension plan resulting from a planned abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal in addition  we incurred million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 
in fiscal  we introduced our energiz program  which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity  improve customer contractual compliance  and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 
employee severance  litigation and other for fiscal included severance costs of million related to our energiz program  a million charge related to the preliminary settlement of a qui tam matter as described in note legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 
we incurred a million charge related to intangible asset impairments in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal  up basis points from the prior fiscal year 
this was primarily due to our recent acquisitions 
for the pharmaceutical distribution segment  as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were down basis points from the prior fiscal year 

table of contents operating income fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other employee severance  litigation and other operating income segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance  litigation and other 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased million from the prior fiscal year due to the decrease in its operating expenses  offset in part by a decrease in its gross profit 
other operating income increased million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the million of contributions made by our recent acquisitions  primarily world courier and theracom 
we expect our operating income margin to decline in fiscal due to our new express scripts contract  which significantly increases our mix of lower margin brand business  the loss of a large food drug combo customer  the negative impact of certain customer contract renewals  and a lower number of brand to generic conversions expected in fiscal the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the costs relating to employee severance  litigation and other  and the asset impairments was to decrease operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in both fiscal and other income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition 
interest expense  interest income  and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of million in average borrowings  primarily due to the november issuance of our new million senior notes due in addition  interest costs capitalized related to our business transformation project of million and million in fiscal and  respectively had the effect of reducing interest expense for those periods 
our average invested cash was billion during both fiscal and despite the similar levels of average cash  interest income was lower in our current fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts 
cash held in these accounts partially offset bank fees 
our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings  interest rates  amendments to our current borrowing facilities  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
we currently expect our interest expense to be lower in fiscal since we repaid our million of senior notes in september income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily the result of a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets primarily relating to our canadian drug distribution operations 
we expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately income from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income and was offset in part by the increases in interest expense and income taxes 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  of million and million  represents the income of andersonbrecon in both fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  revenue fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other intersegment eliminations revenue revenue of billion in fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was due to the growth of abdc  offset in part by the revenue decline of absg 
pharmaceutical distribution segment abdc s revenue increased from fiscal due to overall pharmaceutical market growth  and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers  primarily our institutional customers 
absg s revenue of billion in fiscal decreased by from fiscal primarily due to the september discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model 
absg s revenue decline in fiscal was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers  and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals 
during both fiscal and  of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers 
sales to institutional customers increased in fiscal and sales to retail customers increased in fiscal other other revenue increased million from fiscal primarily due to the strong performance of the lash group  which provides commercialization support services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers 
gross profit fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change gross profit gross profit of billion in fiscal increased million or from fiscal this increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the impact of certain specialty generic product introductions launches  the continued strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
all of the above was offset  in part  by normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
oxaliplatin  gemcitabine  and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were launched in the quarters ended september   december  and march   respectively 
the gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in fiscal was higher than the benefit achieved from oxaliplatin alone in fiscal by approximately million 
sales of oxaliplatin  the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs  benefited our gross profit by approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
beginning in our fourth quarter ended september   the gross profit contributions from the sales gemcitabine and docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined 
in fiscal  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this compared to a recognized gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in fiscal these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 
lastly  in fiscal  we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us 
our gross profit benefited by approximately million in fiscal as a result of having completed this reconciliation 
as a percentage of revenue  our gross profit margin of in fiscal improved by basis points from fiscal due to the above mentioned generic oncology drug launches  the strong growth and profitability of our non specialty generic programs and increased contributions from fee for service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers  who benefit from our best pricing  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 
additionally  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  as noted above  contributed basis points to our gross margin in fiscal we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change distribution  selling and administrative depreciation and amortization employee severance  litigation and other intangible asset impairments total operating expenses in fiscal  we started to incur significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new erp system 
additionally  in fiscal  abdc implemented its energiz program  which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity  improve customer contractual compliance  and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 
distribution  selling and administrative expenses in fiscal increased due to incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms and an increase in consulting expenses related to abdc s energiz program 
in fiscal  asset impairment charges included a write off of capitalized software of million  which was included within distribution  selling and administrative expenses 
depreciation expense increased from fiscal primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system 
employee severance  litigation and other in fiscal included million related to our energiz program  a million charge related to the preliminary qui tam settlement the qui tam matter as described in note legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and million of costs related to business acquisitions 
fiscal benefited from the reversal of a million legal accrual 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal  an increase of basis points from fiscal this increase was due to the same matters as noted above and was offset  in part  by our operating leverage  particularly within abdc 
operating income fiscal year ended september  dollars in thousands change pharmaceutical distribution other employee severance  litigation and other operating income segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance  litigation and other 
pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased million from fiscal due to the increase in its gross profit  offset  in part  by an increase in its operating expenses 
other operating income in fiscal decreased million primarily due to a million intangible asset impairment charge 
the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements  the costs relating to employee severance  litigation and other  and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal interest expense  interest income  and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal and were as follows in thousands amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate interest expense interest income interest expense  net 
table of contents interest expense in fiscal increased from fiscal due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project 
interest costs capitalized had the effect of reducing interest expense and were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
interest income decreased from fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in non interest bearing cash accounts 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective income tax rate of  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes 
income from continuing operations in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to the increase in operating income 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from in fiscal the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding  primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  represented the income from andersonbrecon in both fiscal and critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september    and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september    and was million  million  and million respectively 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 
supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us 
we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 
loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of our inventories at september  and  respectively  has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if we had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and million higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 

table of contents business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company  including the fair value of any contingent consideration  is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  software technology and non compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal   and  and  as a result  recorded million  and million of impairment charges in fiscal and  respectively 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
share based compensation we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

table of contents the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table illustrates our debt structure at september   including availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility in thousands outstanding balance additional availability fixed rate debt  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due total fixed rate debt variable rate debt multi currency revolving credit facility due receivables securitization facility due other total variable rate debt total debt  including current portion along with our cash balances  our aggregate availability under our multi currency revolving credit facility and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements

in november  we further extended the maturity date to november interest on borrowings under the multi currency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from basis points to basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee  as applicable basis points over libor euribor bankers acceptance stamping fee at september  
additionally  interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate 
we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multi currency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating  ranging from basis points to basis points  annually  of the total commitment basis points at september  
we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multi currency revolving credit facility at any time 
the multi currency revolving credit facility contains covenants  including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test  as well as others that impose limitations on  among other things  indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales  which we are compliant with as of september  on october   we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to million at any one time 
amounts available under the program may be borrowed  repaid  and re borrowed from time to time 
the maturities on the notes will vary  but may not exceed days from the date of issuance 
the notes will bear interest rates  if interest bearing  or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts 
the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multi currency revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at september  we have a million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility  which was scheduled to expire in april in october  we entered into an amendment to the receivables securitization facility to extend the maturity date to october the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates

we currently pay an unused fee of basis points  annually  to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility 
at september   there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility 
the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multi currency revolving credit facility 

table of contents in connection with the receivables securitization facility  abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility 
after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected  additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility 
we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
we have million of senior notes due september  the notes  and million of senior notes due november  the notes 
the notes were sold at of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 
the notes were sold in november at of the principal amount and have an effective yield of

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and  therefore  could reduce purchases by our customers 
in addition  volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms 
reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth  our profitability  and our cash flow from operations

merchandise inventories increased million from the september  balance due to the timing of inventory purchases

we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future 
however  the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
market risk our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt 
we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at september   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements 
we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates 
however  there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us 
there were no such financial instruments in effect at september  we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents 
we had billion in cash and cash equivalents at september   of which million was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions 
the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt 
for every million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by million 
we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non us operations 
our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar  the uk pound sterling  and the euro 
we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates 
such contracts generally have durations of less than one year 
we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure  but not for speculative or trading purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
we are evaluating our presentation options under asu no 
 however  we do not expect adoption of this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation 
we intend to adopt this asu in our quarter ending december  in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
under asu no 
 an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the entity determines that this threshold is not met  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years that begin after december   and early adoption is permitted 
we intend to adopt this asu in our fiscal year beginning october  
table of contents in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
simplifies how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
an entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment  while no further analysis would be required if it passes 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   and early adoption is permitted
