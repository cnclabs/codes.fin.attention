item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we are a leading provider of high speed fixed and mobile broadband services  advanced satellite and wireless networks and secure networking systems  products and services 
we have leveraged our success developing complex satellite communication systems and equipment for the us government and select commercial customers to develop next generation satellite broadband technologies and services for both fixed and mobile users 
our product  systems and broadband service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies  customer applications and market relationships 
we believe that our portfolio of products and services  combined with our ability to effectively cross deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets  provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies 
viasat operates in three segments satellite services  commercial networks and government systems 
on december   we acquired wildblue  a leading ka band satellite broadband internet service provider 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash and issued approximately million shares of viasat common stock to wildblue equity and debt holders see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on july   we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the parent company of stonewood  a privately held company registered in england and wales see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues our satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from our domestic satellite broadband services business and from our worldwide managed network services 
our domestic satellite broadband services business comprised approximately and of total revenues during fiscal years and  respectively  and an insignificant amount during fiscal year with respect to our commercial networks and government systems segments  to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 
our products in these segments are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
fixed price contracts  which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price  comprised approximately of our total revenues for fiscal year  of our total revenues for fiscal year and of our total revenues for fiscal year the remainder of our revenue in these segments for such periods was derived from cost reimbursement contracts under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development from our customer contracts were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur ir d expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
ir d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development projects 
ir d expenses were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year and of total revenues in each of fiscal year and fiscal year as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our ir d expenses pursuant to our government contracts 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications 
sales related to these contracts are accounted for under the authoritative guidance for the percentage of completion method of accounting asc 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded either based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract  or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
for contract claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future cost on our programs through regular evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
however  these estimates require significant management judgment and a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of march  would change our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we also derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products or performance of services in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition asc 
under this standard  we recognize revenue when an arrangement exists  prices are fixed and determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered 
we also enter into certain leasing arrangements with customers and evaluate the contracts in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases asc 
our accounting for equipment leases involves specific determinations under the authoritative guidance  which often involve complex provisions and significant judgments 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases  we classify the transactions as sales type or operating leases based on review for transfers of ownership of the property to the 
table of contents lessee by the end of the lease term  review of the lease terms to determine if it contains an option to purchase the leased property for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property at the date of the option  review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment  and review of the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
additionally  we consider the cancelability of the contract and any related uncertainty of collections or risk in recoverability of the lease investment at lease inception 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease or when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer site  if installation is required 
revenues from equipment rentals under operating leases are recognized as earned over the lease term  which is generally on a straight line basis 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements asc  and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is impacted by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues represent cash collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition and are recorded in accrued liabilities for obligations within the next twelve months 
deferred revenues extending beyond the twelve months are recorded within other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
amounts expected to be incurred within twelve months are classified as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
property  equipment and satellites satellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired  the fair value at the date of acquisition  net of accumulated depreciation 
capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch  including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in orbit testing  the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites  costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction  and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction 
we also construct gateway facilities  network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites  and those construction costs  including interest  are capitalized as incurred 
at the time satellites are placed in service  we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance against the original manufacturers orbital design life  estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates  as well as historical satellite operating trends 
in october  our new high capacity ka band spot beam satellite  viasat  was successfully launched into orbit 
the satellite manufacturer handed over operation of the satellite to us in december  following the successful completion of the manufacturer s in orbit testing 
in january  we commenced commercial operation of our exede broadband services 
as a result of the acquisition of wildblue in december  we acquired the wildblue satellite which had been placed into service in march and an exclusive prepaid lifetime capital lease of ka band capacity on telesat canada s anik f satellite which had been placed into service in april and related gateway and networking equipment on both satellites 
the acquired assets also included the cpe units leased to subscribers under wildblue s retail leasing program 
occasionally  we may enter into capital lease arrangements for various machinery  equipment  computer related equipment  software  furniture or fixtures 
as of march  and april   assets under capital lease totaled approximately million 
we record amortization of assets leased under capital lease arrangements within depreciation expense 

table of contents impairment of long lived and other long term assets property  equipment and satellites  and other assets  including goodwill in accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property  equipment and satellites and other assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of the satellite to determine if revisions to the estimated life are necessary 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
no material impairments were recorded by us for fiscal years  and we account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets asc 
we early adopted the provisions of asu  testing goodwill for impairment  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if  after completing our qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  we compare the fair value to our carrying value including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value  we conclude that no impairment exists 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value  resulting in goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections  changes in our weighted average cost of capital  changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date  changes in the overall economy  our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date  trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values  trends in peer companies total enterprise value metrics  and additional factors such as management turnover  changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters 
based on the company s qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded its carrying value as of march  and  therefore  determined it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes asc  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from million at april  to million at march  the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
under the authoritative guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of business there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision 
we believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
however  if these provided amounts prove to be more than what 
table of contents is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense would result

table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets we amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives ranging from eight months to ten years 
the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal year compared to last fiscal year was a result of an approximately million decrease in amortization as certain acquired technology intangibles in our government systems and commercial networks segment became fully amortized over the preceding twelve months  offset by an increase in amortization of approximately million due to our acquisition of stonewood in july expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest income the decrease in interest income of million year over year was primarily due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year interest expense the increase in interest expense year over year of approximately million was primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with our viasat satellite  related gateway and networking equipment  and other related assets which were placed into service during the fourth quarter of fiscal year additionally  the notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year caused an increase in interest expense year over year

this decrease was offset by an increase in cost of product revenues of million due to an additional program forward loss in our government systems segment for a government satellite communication program recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year  as discussed below  and an additional increase in cost of product revenues of million mainly as a result of product cost increases from lower margin development programs in our consumer broadband  information assurance and next generation tactical datalink product areas 
in june  we performed extensive integration testing of numerous system components that had been separately developed as part of a government satellite communication program 
as a result of this testing and subsequent internal reviews and analyses  we determined that significant additional rework was required in order to complete the program requirements and specifications and to prepare for a scheduled customer test in our fiscal second quarter 
this additional rework and engineering effort resulted in a substantial increase in estimated labor and material costs to complete the program 
accordingly  during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an additional forward loss of million related to this estimate of program costs 
cost of service revenues increased from million to million during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year primarily due to our acquisition of wildblue in december  which contributed to an increase of approximately million

backlog as reflected in the table below  both firm and funded backlog increased during fiscal year due to an increase in the government systems segment despite continuing us government defense budget delays  and due to an increase in the commercial networks segment 
as of march  as of april  in millions firm backlog satellite services segment commercial networks segment government systems segment total funded backlog satellite services segment commercial networks segment government systems segment total the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
our total new awards were  million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
new contract awards in fiscal year were a record for us 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer 
orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract 
firm backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures 
table of contents on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing  debt financing and equity financing 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the general cash needs of our satellite services  commercial networks and government systems segments can vary significantly 
the cash needs of our satellite services segment tend to be driven primarily by the timing of payment of capital expenditures eg  under satellite construction and launch contracts and of network expansion activities  as well as the quality of customer  type of contract and payment terms 
in our commercial networks segment  cash needs tend to be driven primarily by the type and mix of contracts in backlog  the nature and quality of customers  and the payment terms of customers including whether advance payments are made or customer financing is required 
in our government systems segment  the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog ie  product or service  development or production and timing of payments including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under us government procurement regulations 
other factors affecting the cash needs of our commercial networks and government systems segments include contract duration and program performance 
for example  if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements  then its cash flow requirements are usually lower 
to further enhance our liquidity position  we may obtain additional financing  which could consist of debt  convertible debt or equity financing from public and or private capital markets 
in march  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of an unlimited amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants and rights 
the securities may be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us  by selling security holders  or through underwriters  dealers or agents at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing and amount of cash required for future broadband satellite projects we may engage in  expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts  and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million compared to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year of million 
this million decrease was primarily driven by a million year over year increase in cash used to fund net operating asset needs 
the increase in net operating assets was focused in our inventory growth  increasing million during fiscal year in preparation for the commencement of our exede broadband services in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and associated new subscriber orders  as well as due to a million increase in combined billed and unbilled accounts receivables  net  compared to the prior fiscal year period attributable to the contractual timing of certain milestones in our commercial networks segment 
these cash uses were offset by an increase of approximately million in our collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues during fiscal year included in accrued liabilities due to the timing of milestone billings for certain larger development projects in our government systems segment 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was million compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to million and million less cash used during fiscal year compared to the same period last year for the construction of our viasat satellite and the acquisition of stonewood  respectively  offset by an approximately million increase in cash used for capital expenditures for new cpe units and other general purpose equipment  an approximately million increase in cash used for next generation consumer broadband capital software development and an approximately million increase in cash used for other long term assets 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year this million increase was derived from the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of notes in february  offset by million in repayments of borrowings under our credit facility and higher payments of debt issuance costs of million 
in addition  cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  which raised million less cash year over year  and cash used for the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards 
satellite related activities in october  our high capacity ka band spot beam satellite  viasat  was successfully launched into orbit 
ss l handed over operation of the satellite to us in december  following the successful completion of the manufacturer s in orbit testing  and we commenced commercial operation of our viasat based exede broadband services in january since the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we have incurred significant operating costs in connection with the commencement of our new viasat service offerings  including costs associated with our new data center and billing system and connectivity costs for the viasat gateways  which have negatively impacted income from operations 
with viasat now in service  we expect operating income to decline substantially over the next few quarters as depreciation from our viasat satellite and related gateway and networking equipment and increased sales and marketing costs will outpace incremental revenue from customers in our satellite services segment 
we expect this trend to reverse once our customer base for our broadband satellite services substantially increases  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
in addition  we expect interest expense to increase as we no longer capitalize the interest expense relating to the debt incurred to build viasat and the related gateway and networking equipment now that viasat is in service 
further  we expect our capital expenditures to increase significantly in the next fiscal year as a result of increased subscriber acquisition costs as our customer base expands 
we are involved in a variety of claims  suits  investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including actions with respect to intellectual property claims and other matters 
see legal proceedings in item for a discussion of certain patent infringement litigation involving ss l and loral  a related party 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can have an adverse impact on us because we expect to incur costs  which may vary based on interim rulings  discovery and other related activities 
in addition  it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 
credit facility as of march   the credit facility provided a revolving line of credit of million including up to million of letters of credit  with a maturity date of january  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the highest of the federal funds rate plus  the eurodollar rate plus or the administrative agent s prime rate as announced from time to time  or the eurodollar rate plus  in the case of each of and  an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio 
we have capitalized certain amounts of interest expense on our credit facility in connection with the construction of viasat  related gateway and networking equipment  and other assets during the construction period 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our respective assets 
the credit facility contains financial covenants regarding a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to sell assets  make investments and acquisitions  make capital expenditures  grant liens  pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments 
at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and million outstanding under standby letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability under the credit facility as of march  of million 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  on may   we amended and restated the credit facility to  among other things  increase our letter of credit sub limit from million to million and amend certain of the covenants under the credit facility to provide us with greater flexibility in the operation of our business 
commitments under the amended and restated revolving line of credit terminate on may

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
pursuant to our satellite related activities  we may be required to pay up to million including interest to ss l  the manufacturer of our viasat satellite  for satellite performance incentives over a fifteen year period based on the performance of the satellite 
as of march   we recorded a million liability representing the net present value of these expected estimated future satellite performance incentives payments and accrued interest 
we have also entered into an agreement with a supplier for an additional satellite launch which can be used for a future satellite 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments

recent authoritative guidance in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables asu  which updated asc 
this new guidance impacts the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  this guidance modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
we adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year without a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement asc amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the new authoritative guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between gaap and ifrs 
while many of the amendments to gaap are not expected to have a significant effect on practice  the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
this guidance became effective for us beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we adopted this authoritative guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year without a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc presentation of comprehensive income 
the new authoritative guidance requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december  the fasb further amended its guidance to defer changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments indefinitely as a result of concerns raised by stakeholders that the new presentation requirements would be difficult for preparers and add unnecessary complexity to financial statements 
the authoritative guidance other than the portion regarding the presentation of reclassification adjustments which  as noted above  has been deferred indefinitely will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year and should be applied retrospectively  however  early adoption is permitted 
the authoritative guidance  as amended  will impact the presentation of the financial statements but will not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other asc testing goodwill for impairment 
the new authoritative guidance simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the new authoritative guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the two step quantitative impairment test is required only if  based on its qualitative assessment  an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
this authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this authoritative guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year without a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet asc disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the new authoritative guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments in the scope of this authoritative guidance 
this authoritative guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this authoritative guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  and short term and long term obligations  including the credit facility and the senior notes 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
as of march   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the senior notes  and we held no short term investments 
because the senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit facility  cash equivalents  short term investments and short term obligations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balance in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates 
given recent declines in interest rates  our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents  assuming balances remain constant over a year  changed by basis points  interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million for each of the fiscal years ended march  and april  because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material 
our primary interest rate under the credit facility is the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that is based on our leverage ratio 
under the amended and restated credit facility  the weighted average effective interest rate as of may  that would have been applied to any new borrowings under the credit facility was approximately 
as of march   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
accordingly  assuming the outstanding balance remained constant over a year  changes in interests rates applicable to our credit facility would have no effect on our interest incurred and cash flow 
foreign exchange risk we generally conduct our business in us dollars 
however  as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of march   we had a number of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding which are intended to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros 
the foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million had a fair value of approximately million and were recorded in accrued liabilities as of march  if the foreign currency forward rate for the euro to the us dollar on these foreign currency forward contracts had changed by  the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts as of march  would have changed by approximately million
