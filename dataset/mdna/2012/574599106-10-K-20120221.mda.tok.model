item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  expect  assume  seek  appear  may  should  will  forecast and similar references to future periods 
these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
we caution you against relying on any of these forward looking statements 
in addition to the various factors included in the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  our future performance may be affected by our reliance on new home construction and home improvement  our reliance on key customers  the cost and availability of raw materials  shifts in consumer preferences and purchasing practices  and our ability to achieve cost savings through business rationalizations and other initiatives 
these and other factors are discussed in detail in item a risk factors of this report 
any forward looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date on which it was made 
factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict all of them 
unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview we manufacture  distribute and install home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and new home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  homebuilders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors and direct to the consumer 
results 
the following is a summary of the significant factors affecting us in our cabinets and related products segment continues to be negatively affected by softness in the new home construction market and increased competitive market conditions in the repair and remodel market 
further  the cabinets and related products segment continued to incur costs and charges related to the integration of our north american cabinet manufacturers that began in and other plant closures and consolidations  including the exit of certain product lines 
this segment also incurred goodwill impairment charges related to our ready to assemble cabinet manufacturer in europe 
our plumbing products segment continues to realize increased sales volume and selling prices  offset by increased commodity costs and a less favorable product mix 
the installation and other services segment was positively affected by increased distribution sales  increased selling prices and increased retrofit and commercial sales  which partially offset decreases in sales volume related to the new home construction market 
we also decided to divest certain operations in the installation and other services segment that are not core to our long term growth strategy  such operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
the decorative architectural products segment was negatively affected by lower sales volume of paints and stains due to increasingly competitive market conditions and increased commodity costs  this segment also incurred goodwill impairment charges related to the builders hardware business unit and rationalization costs related to the exit of a builders hardware product line 
our other specialty products segment was negatively impacted by lower sales volume due to continuing weakness in our markets and increased business rationalization costs related to the closure of several facilities 

table of contents in  we experienced increased commodity costs  and the economy continued to experience a further decline in home values  lack of job creation and depressed consumer confidence  hindering a housing recovery  all of which negatively impacted our performance 
during we continued to take actions to further reduce our cost structure  including closing several branch locations in the installation and other services segment  closing several manufacturing facilities related to our north american window manufacturer  closing one manufacturing facility related to our european ready to assemble cabinet manufacturer  one facility related to our north american cabinet manufacturer and continued to integrate our north american cabinet manufacturers 
we incurred costs and charges related to these and other actions of million 
we believe that these actions  together with actions taken over the last several years  have positioned us well for the current environment and for the recovery in our markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience  as well as current economic conditions and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables we recognize revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
we record revenue for unbilled services performed based upon estimates of material and labor incurred in the installation and other services segment  such amounts are recorded in receivables 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
in addition  we monitor our customer receivable balances and the credit worthiness of our customers on an on going basis 
during downturns in our markets  declines in the financial condition and creditworthiness of customers impact the credit risk of the receivables involved and we have incurred bad debt expense related to customer defaults 
our bad debt expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  we monitor these estimates and record adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 

table of contents financial investments we follow accounting guidance that defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for our financial investments and liabilities 
this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
further  it defines a fair value hierarchy  as follows level inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs as observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data  and level inputs as unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models or instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
if applicable  we record investments in available for sale securities at fair value  and unrealized gains or losses that are deemed to be temporary are recognized  net of tax effect  through shareholders equity  as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet 
during and  we sold all of our shares of our investment in trimas common stock for cash of million and million  respectively 
in the past  we have invested excess cash in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are investment securities that have interest rates which are reset every  or days 
at december   our investment in auction rate securities was million  we have not increased our investment in auction rate securities since the fair value of auction rate securities is estimated  on a recurring basis  using a discounted cash flow model level input 
if we changed the discount rate used in the fair value estimate by basis points  the value of the auction rate securities would change by approximately million 
we have maintained investments in a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million at december  we carry our investments in private equity funds and other private investments at cost 
it is not practicable for us to estimate a fair value for private equity funds and other private investments because there are no quoted market prices  and sufficient information is not readily available for us to utilize a valuation model to determine the fair value for each fund 
these investments are evaluated  on a non recurring basis  for potential other than temporary impairment when impairment indicators are present  or when an event or change in circumstances has occurred  that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
due to the significant unobservable inputs  the fair value measurements used to evaluate impairment are a level input 
impairment indicators we consider include the following whether there has been a significant deterioration in earnings performance  asset quality or business prospects  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment  a significant adverse change in the general market condition or geographic area in which the investment operates  industry and sector performance  current equity and credit market conditions  and any bona fide offers to purchase the investment for less than the carrying value 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the fund  including industry and sector performance 
the significant assumptions utilized in analyzing a fund for potential other than temporary impairment include current economic conditions  market analysis for specific funds and performance indicators in residential and commercial construction  bio technology  health care and information technology sectors in which the applicable funds investments operate 
at december   we have investments in venture capital funds  with an aggregate carrying value of million 
the venture capital funds invest in start up or smaller  early stage established businesses  principally in the information technology  bio technology and health care sectors 
at december   we also have investments in buyout funds  with an aggregate carrying value of million 
the buyout funds invest in later stage  established businesses and no buyout fund has a concentration in a particular sector 

table of contents since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
the timing of distributions from the funds  which depends on particular events related to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of income we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of these investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
we record an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of each year  or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  we complete the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
we selected the discounted cash flow methodology because we believe that it is comparable to what would be used by other market participants 
we have defined our reporting units and completed the impairment testing of goodwill at the operating segment level  as defined by accounting guidance 
our operating segments are reporting units that engage in business activities for which discrete financial information  including five year forecasts  is available 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
our judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes 
in estimating future cash flows  we rely on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
we generally develop these forecasts based upon  among other things  recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in  we utilized estimated housing starts  from independent industry sources  growing from current levels to million units in terminal growth year and operating profit margins improving to approximate historical levels for those business units by terminal growth year 
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital of approximately seven percent as the basis to determine the discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows 
in  due to market conditions and based upon our assessment of the risks impacting each of our businesses  we applied a risk premium to increase the discount rate to a range of ten percent to percent for most of our reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  we estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of our reporting units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no effect on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets step two analysis 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents in  we recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for goodwill aggregating million million  after tax 
the pre tax impairment charge of million in the cabinets and related products segment relates to our european ready to assemble cabinet manufacturer and reflects the continued declining demand for certain products  as well as decreased operating margins 
the pre tax impairment charge of million in the decorative architectural products segment relates to our builders hardware business and reflects increasing competitive conditions for this business 
the pre tax impairment charge of million in the other specialty products segment relates to our north american window and door business 
the charge reflects the continuing weak level of new home construction activity in the western us in  the reduced levels of repair and remodel activity and the expectation that the recovery in these segments will be modestly slower than previously anticipated 
a ten percent decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units at december  would not have resulted in any additional analysis of goodwill impairment for any additional business unit 
we review our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  in the fourth quarter  or as events occur or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
we consider the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
in  we recognized non cash  pre tax impairment charges for other indefinite lived intangible assets of million million  after tax attributable to our plumbing products segment million  and our other specialty products segment million 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
stock based compensation our long term stock incentive plan the plan provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms to employees and non employee directors 
at december   outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of long term stock awards  stock options  phantom stock awards and stock appreciation rights 
long term stock awards we grant long term stock awards to key employees and non employee directors and do not cause net share dilution inasmuch as we continue the practice of repurchasing and retiring an equal number of shares on the open market 
we measure compensation expense for stock awards at the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
there was million ten million common shares of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock awards at december   which was included as a reduction of common stock and paid in capital 
effective january   the vesting period for stock awards awarded after january  is five years 
for stock awards granted prior to january   we recognize this expense over the vesting period of the stock awards  typically five to ten years  or for executive grantees that are  or will become  retirement eligible during the vesting period  we recognize the expense over five years or immediately upon a grantee s retirement 
effective january   we recognize this expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock awards  typically five to ten years except for stock awards held by grantees age or older  which vest over five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age pre tax compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was million for 
table of contents stock options we grant stock options to key employees 
the exercise price equals the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
these options generally become exercisable vest ratably over five years beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than ten years after the grant date 
we measure compensation expense for stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
we recognize this compensation expense ratably over the shorter of the vesting period of the stock options  typically five years  or the length of time until the grantee becomes retirement eligible at age pre tax compensation expense for stock options was million for we estimated the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor and expected option life six years 
for expense calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in was per option share 
if we increased our assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would increase by percent 
if we lowered our assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease by percent 
employee retirement plans effective january   we froze all future benefit accruals under substantially all of our domestic qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
as a result of this action  the liabilities for these plans were remeasured  in addition  certain assumptions appropriate for on going plans eg  turnover  mortality and compensation increases have been modified or eliminated for the remeasurement 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based upon vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
we develop our pension costs and obligations from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and discount rates for obligations and expenses 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to reported pension costs and obligations within our consolidated financial statements 
in december  we decreased our discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations is based upon the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  towers watson rate link curve 
the discount rates we use for our defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
our net underfunded amount for our qualified defined benefit pension plans  which is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to lower rates of return in the bond market in in accordance with accounting guidance  the underfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net loss of approximately two percent compared to average gains of one percent for the corporate funds universe within the independent consultant cooperative 

table of contents our projected benefit obligation for our unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december  this unfunded amount has been recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and at december   we reported a net liability of million  of which million was related to our non qualified  supplemental retirement plans  which are not subject to the funding requirements of the pension protection act of in accordance with the pension protection act  the adjusted funding target attainment percentage aftap for the various defined benefit pension plans ranges from percent to percent 
at december   we had one plan that offered accelerated benefits ie  lump sum distributions and the aftap for that plan is less than percent  therefore  the plan is prohibited from allowing participants to receive any lump sum distribution in excess of percent of the benefit value 
in addition  plan amendments increasing benefits or liabilities for that plan are also prohibited 
we expect pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in if we assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return and the discount rate decreased by basis points  the pension expense would increase by million 
we expect pension expense for our non qualified defined benefit pension plans to be million in compared with million in we anticipate that we will be required to contribute approximately million to million in to our qualified and non qualified defined benefit plans 
income taxes the accounting guidance for income taxes requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability  tax planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income 
if  based upon all available evidence  both positive and negative  it is more likely than not more than percent likely such deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded 
significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable 
a company s three year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
in reaching this conclusion  we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges  that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of  causing us to be in a three year cumulative us loss position 
these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize tax planning strategies that included the potential sale of certain non core operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets  since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryforward period to realize the benefit of the strategies 
during  objective and verifiable negative evidence  such as continued us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges  continued to outweigh positive evidence 
as a result  we recorded an million increase in the valuation allowance related to our us federal deferred tax assets as a non cash charge to income tax expense 

table of contents recording the valuation allowance does not restrict our ability to utilize the future deductions and net operating losses associated with the deferred tax assets assuming taxable income is recognized in future periods 
a rebound in the us housing market from the current historic lows and retail sales of building products improving from their current levels should have a positive impact on our operating results in the us a return to sustained profitability in the us should result in objective positive evidence thereby warranting the potential reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance 
the million and million of deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively  for which there is no valuation allowance recorded  are anticipated to be realized through the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
the need to maintain a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate 
the current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than percent likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we believe that there is an increased potential for volatility in our effective tax rate because this threshold allows changes in the income tax environment and the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of jurisdictions to affect the computation of our liability for uncertain tax positions to a greater extent 
while we believe we have adequately provided for our uncertain tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could vary from our liability for uncertain tax positions 
accordingly  additional provisions for tax related matters  including interest and penalties  could be recorded in income tax expense in the period revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
other commitments and contingencies certain of our products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of sale  we accrue a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that we experience any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our business is at the consumer retail level through home centers and major retailers 
a consumer may return a product to a retail outlet that is a warranty return 
however  certain retail outlets do not distinguish between warranty and other types of returns when they claim a return deduction from us 
our revenue recognition policy takes into account this type of return when recognizing revenue  and we record deductions at the time of sale 
we are subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims in the ordinary course of our business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based upon our professional knowledge and experience and that of our legal counsel 
when estimates of our exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under accounting guidance  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of these exposures may differ due to subsequent developments 
see note s to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of our legal proceedings 

table of contents corporate development strategy our current business strategy includes the rationalization of our business units  including consolidations  and increasing synergies among our business units 
going forward  we expect to maintain a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on cash flow  organic growth with fewer acquisitions and growth through new product development and greenfield locations related to certain installation and other services businesses 
as part of our strategic planning  we continue to review all of our businesses to determine which businesses may not be core to our long term growth strategy 
during  we determined that several business units in the installation and other services segment were no longer core to our long term growth strategy 
these businesses were related to commercial drywall installation  millwork and framing  accordingly  we have embarked on a plan of disposition for these businesses and have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in in late  we acquired a small manufacturer of hot tubs in the plumbing products segment 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have largely funded our growth through cash provided by our operations  long term bank debt and the issuance of notes in the financial markets  and by the issuance of our common stock  including issuances for certain mergers and acquisitions 
maintaining high levels of liquidity and focusing on cash generation are among our financial strategies  such strategies have resulted in cash of approximately billion at december  our total debt as a percent of total capitalization was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with a bank group  with an aggregate commitment of billion with a maturity date of january  the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility available to us and one of our foreign subsidiaries  in us dollars  european euros and certain other currencies 
borrowings under the revolver denominated in euros are limited to million  equivalent 
we can also borrow swingline loans up to million and obtain letters of credit of up to million 
any outstanding letters of credit reduce our borrowing capacity 
at december   we had million of outstanding and unused letters of credit  reducing our borrowing capacity by such amount 
our revolving credit loans bear interest under the credit agreement  at our option at a a rate per annum equal to the greatest of i prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus and iii libor plus the alternative base rate  plus an applicable margin based upon the then applicable corporate credit ratings of the company  or b libor plus an applicable margin based upon the then applicable corporate credit ratings of the company 
the foreign currency revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based upon the then applicable corporate credit ratings of the company 
in order to borrow under the credit agreement  we must not be in default of our covenants under the credit agreement ie  in addition to the debt to total capitalization covenant and a financial covenant  we must meet a minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio  principally limitations on subsidiary debt  negative pledge restrictions  legal compliance requirements and maintenance of properties and insurance and our representations and warranties in the credit agreement must be true in all material respects ie  no material adverse change or litigation likely to result in a material adverse change  no material erisa or environmental non compliance and no material tax deficiency 
we were in compliance with all covenants and we had no borrowings at december  on february   we entered into an amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december  of the credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment provided for the 
table of contents add back to shareholders equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of i certain non cash charges including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets and ii changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense  each taken in  which aggregated million after tax 
the amendment also permitted us to add back  if incurred  up to million in the aggregate of future non cash charges subsequent to december  based on the limitations of the debt to total capitalization covenant before the second amendment discussed below  at december   we had additional borrowing capacity  subject to availability  of up to million 
alternatively  at december   we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately million  and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 
on february   we entered into another amendment deemed to be effective and applicable as of december  of the credit agreement the second amendment 
the second amendment provides for the add back to shareholders equity in our debt to capitalization covenant of i certain non cash charges including impairment charges for financial investments and goodwill and other intangible assets and ii changes to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets included in income tax expense  each taken in and  which aggregate billion after tax 
the second amendment also permits us to add back  if incurred  up to million in the aggregate of future non cash charges subsequent to december  the second amendment also revised the permitted ratio of consolidated ebitda to the consolidated interest expense to to through december   increasing to to with respect to each quarter thereafter 
taking the second amendment into account  at december   we had additional borrowing capacity  subject to availability  of up to million 
alternatively  at december   we could absorb a reduction to shareholders equity of approximately million and remain in compliance with the debt to total capitalization covenant 
we have million of fixed rate debt due july  notes with an interest rate of 
we plan to re finance a portion of the notes in and  therefore  we have entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge the volatility in interest payments associated with this planned debt issuance 
the interest rate swaps are intended to cover a notional amount of million  we anticipate that we will redeem the remaining notes for cash 
we had cash and cash investments of approximately billion at december   principally as a result of strong cash flows from operations 
our cash and cash investments consist of overnight interest bearing money market demand and time deposit accounts  money market mutual funds containing government securities and treasury obligations 
while we attempt to diversify these investments in a prudent manner to minimize risk  it is possible that future changes in the financial markets could affect the security or availability of these investments 
of the billion of cash and cash investments we held at both december  and  million and million  respectively  is held in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds were needed for our operations in the us  their repatriation into the us may result in additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes 
the amount of such taxes is dependent on the income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution 
we have maintained investments in available for sale and marketable securities and a number of private equity funds  principally as part of our tax planning strategies  as any gains enhance the utilization of any current and future capital tax losses 
we determined that the longer maturity of private equity funds would be advantageous and complement our investment in more liquid available for sale and marketable securities to balance risk 
since we have significantly reduced our capital tax losses in part by generating capital gains from investments and other sources  we have and will continue to reduce our investments in long term financial assets 

table of contents we utilize derivative and hedging instruments to manage our exposure to currency fluctuations  primarily related to the european euro and the us dollar  commodity cost fluctuations  primarily zinc and copper  and interest rate fluctuations  primarily related to our anticipated debt issuance in we review our hedging program  derivative positions and overall risk management on a regular basis 
during  we paid a quarterly dividend of 
per common share 
our working capital ratio was to and to at december  and  respectively 
the decline in the working capital ratio is primarily due to the classification to current liabilities of million of notes due july cash flows significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows  in millions net cash from operating activities retirement of notes issuance of notes  net of issuance costs proceeds from disposition of businesses  net of cash disposed property and equipment proceeds from financial investments  net tax benefit from stock based compensation cash dividends paid capital expenditures purchase of company common stock decrease in debt  net dividends paid to noncontrolling interest acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired effect of exchange rates on cash and cash investments other  net cash decrease increase our cash and cash investments decreased million to  million at december   from  million at december  net cash provided by operations of million consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for non cash and certain other items  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  a million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  a million net change in deferred taxes  a million charge for the impairment of assets related to discontinued operations and other non cash items  including stock based compensation expense and amortization expense related to in store displays 
we continue to emphasize balance sheet management  including working capital management and cash flow generation 
days sales in accounts receivable were days at both december  and  and days sales in inventories were days at december  and days at december  accounts payable days were days at december  and days at december   the increase in payable days is due to our improved management of accounts payable 
working capital defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable as a percent of sales was percent at december  and percent at december   such improvement was primarily due to improved accounts payable management 

table of contents net cash used for financing activities was million  and included cash outflows of million for cash dividends paid  million for the net payment of debt and million for the acquisition of our common stock to offset the dilutive impact of long term stock awards granted in at december   we had remaining authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock in open market transactions or otherwise 
we believe that our present cash balance and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our near term working capital and other investment needs 
we believe that our longer term working capital and other general corporate requirements will be satisfied through cash flows from operations and  to the extent necessary  from bank borrowings and future financial market activities 
consistent with past practice  we anticipate repurchasing shares in to offset any dilution from long term stock awards granted or stock options exercised as part of our compensation programs 
net cash used for investing activities was million  and included million for capital expenditures 
cash provided by investing activities included primarily million of net proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment and million from the net sale of financial investments 
we invest in automating our manufacturing operations to increase our productivity  improve customer service and support new product innovation 
capital expenditures for were million  compared with million for and million for  for  capital expenditures  excluding any potential acquisitions  are expected to be approximately million

our effective tax rate for the loss from continuing operations was a percent tax benefit  a percent tax expense  and a percent tax benefit in  and  respectively 
compared to our normalized effective tax rate of percent  the variance in the effective tax rate in and is due primarily to changes in the us federal valuation allowance  reversal of an accrual for uncertain tax positions and goodwill impairment charges providing no tax benefit 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
in reaching this conclusion  we considered the weaker retail sales of certain of our building products and the slower than anticipated recovery in the us housing market which led to us operating losses and significant us goodwill impairment charges  that primarily occurred in the fourth quarter of  causing us to be in a three year cumulative us loss position 
these factors negatively impact our ability to utilize previously identified tax planning strategies that included the potential sale of certain non core operating assets to support the realization of our us federal deferred tax assets  since current year losses are heavily weighted in determining if sufficient income would exist in the carryfoward period to realize the benefits of the strategies

we believe these initiatives  coupled with the actions we have taken over the past several years  should position us for improved results in even in a flat housing market  and continue to believe that we will outperform as the housing market recovers 
we believe and are confident that the long term fundamentals for the new home construction and home improvement markets continue to be positive 
we believe that our strong financial position  together with our current strategy of investing in leadership brands  including kraftmaid and merillat cabinets  delta and hansgrohe faucets  behr paint and milgard windows  our continued focus on innovation and our commitment to lean principles  will allow us to drive long term growth and create value for our shareholders

we are contractually obligated to make additional capital contributions to these private equity funds upon receipt of a capital call from the private equity fund 
we have no control over when or if the capital calls will occur 
capital calls are funded in cash and generally result in an increase in the carrying value of our investment in the private equity fund when paid 
we enter into contracts  which include reasonable and customary indemnifications that are standard for the industries in which we operate 
such indemnifications include claims made against builders by homeowners for issues relating to our products and workmanship 
in conjunction with divestitures and other transactions  we occasionally provide reasonable and customary indemnifications relating to various items  including the enforceability of trademarks  legal and environmental issues  and provisions for sales returns 
we have never had to pay a material amount related to these indemnifications  and we evaluate the probability that amounts may be incurred and we appropriately record an estimated liability when probable

recently issued accounting pronouncements 
effective january   we adopted new accounting guidance which addresses how to determine whether a sales arrangement involves multiple deliverables or contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the sales arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
we evaluated this new guidance and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
in june  new accounting guidance was issued regarding the presentation and disclosure of comprehensive income 
the new guidance will require presentation of other comprehensive income items in our consolidated statement of income  such items will no longer be included in the statement of shareholders equity 
the new guidance will be effective for us january  the new guidance will also require additional disclosure for reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to our statement of income  however  this requirement has been delayed 
we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations 
in september  new accounting guidance was issued regarding impairment testing of goodwill 
the new guidance would allow us to make a qualitative determination regarding potential goodwill impairment before performing the quantitative impairment test 
the new guidance will be effective for us january  we do not anticipate utilizing the qualitative provisions of the new guidance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of accounting guidance regarding disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity costs in the normal course of business and to market price fluctuations related to our financial investments 
we have involvement with derivative financial instruments and use such instruments to the extent necessary to manage exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and commodity fluctuations 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
at december   we had entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations related primarily to the european euro and the us dollar  several metals contracts to manage our exposure to increases in the price of copper and zinc and interest rate swap agreements to hedge the volatility in interest payments associated with our expected debt issuance in at december   we performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential loss in the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical change of percent in foreign currency exchange rates  a percent decline in the market value of our long term investments  a percent change in commodity costs  or a percent change in interest rates 
based upon the analyses performed  such changes would not be expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
