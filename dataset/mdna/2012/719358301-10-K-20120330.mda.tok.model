item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial data  in this narrative  are expressed in thousands  except for the earnings per share 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction  outlook and overview of business operations our current strategic focus is built upon three key components skilled direct sales force to target physician and professional segments  expertise in global consumer marketing and a full product life cycle model 
we believe that we are one of only a few aesthetic dermatology companies to have succeeded in taking professional technologies geared toward physicians and med spas and adapting them for the home use market 
our professional and consumer use products are listed below  noting that this is not an exhaustive listing of our product portfolio but represents our current key areas of focus 
key technology platforms thermicon brand heat transfer technology 
in this technique  a patented thermodynamic wire gently singes and burns off the hair above the skin s surface 
it conducts heat pulses which enables longer lasting hair removal 
this technology drives our home use no no hair removal device  which is designed to reduce hair growth 
product variations include devices designed for men and for sensitive  small areas such as the face  among other versions 
lhe brand technology 
lhe combines direct heat and a full spectrum light source to give a greater treatment advantage for psoriasis and acne care  skin tightening  skin rejuvenation  wrinkle reduction  collagen renewal  vascular and pigmented lesion treatments  and hair removal 
using lhe  the mistral intelligent phototherapy medical device can treat a larger spot size than a laser with less discomfort 
as well  our research finds that lhe offers meaningful results for thin  light hair 
the technology is also used in the no no skin  a handheld consumer product sold worldwide under the no no brand 
the no no skin is a k cleared product that has been clinically shown to reduce acne by over hours 
xtrac excimer laser 
xtrac received an fda clearance in and has since become a widely recognized treatment among dermatologists for psoriasis and other skin conditions for which there are no cures 
the machine delivers narrow ultraviolet b uvb light to affected areas of skin  leading to psoriasis remission in an average of to treatments and of vitiligo after treatments 
xtrac is endorsed by the national psoriasis foundation  and its use for psoriasis is covered by nearly all major insurance companies  including medicare 
nearly of companies now offer reimbursement for vitiligo as well  a figure that is increasing 
neova 
this line of topical formulations is designed to prevent premature skin aging due to uv induced dna damage 
the therapy seeks to repair photo damaged skin using a novel combination of two key ingredients dna repair enzymes and our copper peptide complex 
the neova line includes dna damage control silc sheer spf  an award winning tinted sunscreen 
the dna repair enzymes of this sunscreen are clinically shown to reduce uv damage by and increase uv protection by in one hour 
light emitting diode led technology 
photomedex s led technology is used in both its omnilux and lumi re light therapy systems 
omnilux is fda cleared to treat wrinkles  acne  minor muscle pain and pigmented lesions  and is applicable to all skin types 
lumi re is designed for use in non medical applications and combines the led light with a line of topical lotions to improve the appearance of fine lines  wrinkles  skin tone and blemishes  giving aesthetic professionals a complete non invasive skin care solution 
our revenue generation is categorized as either consumer  physician recurring or professional 
each segment benefits from the combination of our proprietary global consumer marketing engine with our direct sales force for us physicians 
consumer the global consumer market is our largest business unit due to our success at bringing professional technologies into the home use arena 
over the past three years  we have sold more than million no no products to consumers  the majority of whom have been in japan and north america 
even at this level of sales  we believe we have ample opportunity for further expansion  as japan s population was over million people and north america s was approximately million people far more than the two million who have already been converted to the use of our products 
our consumer marketing platform is built upon a proprietary direct to consumer sales engine and creative marketing programs that drive brand awareness 
sales channels our multi channel marketing and distribution model consists of television  online  print and radio direct response advertising  as well as high end retailers 
we believe that this marketing and distribution model  through which each channel complements and supports the others  provides greater brand awareness across channels  cost effective consumer acquisition and education  premium brand building  and improved convenience for consumers 
direct to consumer 
our direct to consumer channel consists of sales generated through infomercials  websites and call centers 
we utilize several forms of advertising to drive our direct to consumer sales and brand awareness  including print  online  television and radio 
retailers and home shopping channels 
our retailers and home shopping channels enable us to provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our solutions  expand our presence beyond our direct to consumer activity and further strengthen and enhance our brand image 
distributors 
in some territories  we operate through exclusive distribution agreements with leading distribution companies that are dominant in their respective market and have the ability to promote our products through their existing retail and home shopping networks 
markets north america 
our consumer distribution segment in north america had sales of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use a mix of direct to consumer advertising that includes infomercials  commercials  catalog and internet based marketing campaigns  coupled with select retail resellers  such as neiman marcus  henri bendel  planet beauty and others  home shopping channels such as hsn  and online retailers such as amazon  dermadoctor 
com and drugstore 
com 
we believe these channels complement each other  as consumers that have seen our direct to consumer advertising may purchase at our retailers  and those who have seen our solutions demonstrated at our retailers may purchase solutions through our websites or call centers 
international excluding north america 
in the international consumer segment  sales were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we utilize various sales and marketing methods including sales by direct to consumer  sales to retailers and home shopping channels 
our main international markets are japan  united kingdom argentina and australia 
our distribution has become geographically diverse over the past year for example as revenues have increased  our japanese distributor  ya man  ltd  accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december   compared to of total revenues for each of the years ended december  and physician recurring physician recurring sales entail those generated under two of our product lines the xtrac  a noninvasive  fda cleared solution for psoriasis and vitiligo  and the neova  a topical therapy combining dna repair enzymes and copper peptide complexes to prevent premature skin aging  product lines 
both xtrac and neova represent recurring revenue streams with significant market opportunities 
as well  our expertise in direct to consumer advertising and innovative marketing programs is anticipated to drive greater brand awareness and adoption for both xtrac and neova products 
xtrac the xtrac business is considered a recurring revenue stream given its pay per use model  where the machines are provided to professionals who then pay us based on the number of treatments administered with the device 
neova sales of the neova skin care products at present are driven by physicians  who act as spokespersons to their patients in support of the neova line 
we have historically marketed to physicians in the dermatology and plastic surgery field  but plan to supplement these efforts with a direct to consumer approach to lead patients into those dermatology practices 
neova addresses a sizeable global market for anti aging skin care products 
professional sales under the professional business segment are mainly generated from capital equipment  such as our velocity and vtrac equipment  our lhe brand products and our omnilux and lumi re light therapy systems 
this is an area of considerable opportunity for us since the reverse acquisition with radiancy completed on december  we now possess a greatly expanded product offering for the physician community 
in addition  the pre merged photomedex possesses a person  experienced direct sales force that already reaches a network of approximately  physician locations in the us we are now distributing the lhe based professional products in addition to our other equipment to physicians  dermatologists  salons  spas  and other aesthetic practitioners through this direct sales force 
the company views this as a significant opportunity given its fully trained sales staff 
sales and marketing as of december   our sales and marketing personnel consisted of full time positions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  impairment of property and equipment and of intangibles and accruals for warranty claims 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with these policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from the product sales when the following four criteria have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
revenues from product sales are recorded net of provisions for estimated chargebacks  rebates  expected returns and cash discounts 
we ship most of our products fob shipping point  although from time to time certain customers  for example governmental customers  will insist upon fob destination 
among the factors we take into account when determining the proper time at which to recognize revenue are when title to the goods transfers and when the risk of loss transfers 
shipments to distributors or physicians that do not fully satisfy the collection criterion are recognized when invoiced amounts are fully paid or fully assured 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables within a single contractually binding arrangement usually sales of products with separately priced extended warranty  each element of the contract is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting when it provides the customer value on a stand alone basis and there is objective evidence of the fair value of the separate  but related  unit 
with respect to sales arrangements under which the buyer has a right to return the related product  revenue is recognized only if all the following are met the price is fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid  or is obligated to pay and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer has economic substance  we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we provide a provision for product returns based on the experience with historical sales returns  in accordance with asc topic with respect to sales of product when right of return exists 
revenues received with respect to extended warranty on consumer products are recognized over the duration of the warranty period 
we have two distribution channels for our phototherapy treatment equipment 
we either i sell our lasers through a distributor or directly to a physician or ii place our lasers in a physician s office at no charge to the physician and generally charge the physician a fee for an agreed upon number of treatments 
in some cases  the customer and we stipulate to a quarterly or other periodic target of procedures to be performed  and accordingly revenue is recognized ratably over the period 
when we place a laser in a physician s office  we generally recognize service revenue based on the number of patient treatments performed  or purchased under a periodic commitment  by the physician 
treatments to be performed through random laser access codes that are sold to physicians free of a periodic commitment  but not yet used  are deferred and recognized as a liability until the physician performs the treatment 
unused treatments remain an obligation of the company because the treatments can only be performed on equipment which we own and place with the customer 
once the treatments are delivered to a patient  this obligation has been satisfied 
we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to its customers within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by its physician customers 
management believes this approach closely approximates the actual amount of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
revenue from maintenance service agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
revenue from billable services  including repair activity  is recognized when the service is provided 
inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined to be purchased cost for raw materials and the production cost materials  labor and indirect manufacturing cost for work in process and finished goods 
for our consumer and lhe products  cost is determined on the weighted average method 
for the pre merged photomedex s products  cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
throughout the laser manufacturing process  the related production costs are recorded within inventory 
work in process is immaterial  given the typically short manufacturing cycle  and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials 
we perform full physical inventory counts for xtrac and cycle counts on the other inventory to maintain controls and obtain accurate data 
our xtrac laser is either i sold to distributors or physicians directly or ii placed in a physician s office and remains our property 
the cost to build a laser  whether for sale or for placement  is accumulated in inventory 
when a laser is placed in a physician s office  the cost is transferred from inventory to lasers in service within property and equipment 
at times  units are shipped to distributors  but revenue is not recognized until all of the criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
revenue is not recognized from these distributors until payment is either assured or paid in full 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves periodically based on forecasted sales and market trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
from time to time  our customers dispute the amounts due to us  and  in other cases  our customers experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectible accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectible accounts involves significant judgment 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
property and equipment 
as of december  and  we had net property and equipment of  and  respectively 
the most significant component of the december  balance relates to the xtrac lasers placed by us in physicians offices 
we own the equipment and charge the physician on a per treatment basis for use of the equipment 
the recoverability of the net carrying value of the lasers is predicated on continuing revenues from the physicians use of the lasers 
if the physician does not generate sufficient treatments  then we may remove the laser from the physician s office and redeploy elsewhere 
xtrac lasers placed in service are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years 
for other property and equipment  including property and equipment  depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  primarily three to seven years for computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  automobiles and machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or lease terms 
useful lives are determined based upon an estimate of either physical or economic obsolescence  or both 
goodwill and intangibles assets 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on various factors  including market conditions and operational performance of our business 
as of december   we had  of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for of our total assets 
the goodwill is not amortizable  the other intangibles are 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test our goodwill for impairment  which was acquired as part of the reverse acquisition on december   at least annually 
this test is usually conducted in december of each year in connection with the annual budgeting and forecast process 
also  on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether events have occurred that would negatively impact the realizable value of our intangibles or goodwill 
in connection with the reverse acquisition of pre merged photomedex on december   we acquired certain intangibles recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition 
these will be allocated to the operating segments in the balances of these acquired intangibles  net of amortization  were december  customer relationships tradename product and core technologies goodwill total income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and make an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we generate taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in which we has net operating loss carry forwards  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance 
we implemented asc topic  income taxes which clarify the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
asc topic requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position  without regard the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged 
if an uncertain tax position meets the more likely than not threshold  the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be recognized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority is recorded 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with share based payment accounting standard 
the standard requires estimating the fair value of equity based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of employee stock options is estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
compensation costs are recorded using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
except for income tax contingencies commencing january   we record accruals for contingencies to the extent that the management concludes that the occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are estimable 
legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred

we have a program to support certain physicians who may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers for xtrac treatments 
we recognize service revenue during this program from the sale of xtrac procedures or equivalent treatments to physicians participating in this program only to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
in addition  we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to the customer within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers
