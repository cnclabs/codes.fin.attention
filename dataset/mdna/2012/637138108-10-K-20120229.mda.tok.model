item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the change in book value from to reflects million of goodwill impairment recorded in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the earnings performance of the company for the year ended december  and financial condition of the company as of december   with a primary focus on an analysis of operating results 
current performance does not guarantee and may not be indicative of similar performance in the future 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included in this report at item this report contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
national penn s management uses these non gaap measures in its analysis of national penn s performance 
these measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap 
management believes the presentation of the following non gaap financial measures  which exclude the impact of the specified items  provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of national penn 
tangible common equity excludes goodwill and intangible assets and preferred equity 
banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and intangible assets from shareholders equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution 
tangible common equity provides a method to assess the company s tangible capital trends 
tangible book value expresses tangible common equity on a per share basis 
tangible book value provides a method to assess the level of tangible net assets on a per share basis 
adjusted net income excludes the effects of certain gains and losses  adjusted for applicable taxes 
adjusted net income provides a method to assess earnings performance by excluding items that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
efficiency ratio expresses operating expenses as a percentage of fully taxable equivalent net interest income plus non interest income 
operating expenses exclude items from non interest expense that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
non interest income is adjusted to also exclude items that management believes are not comparable among the periods presented 
efficiency ratio is used as a method for management to assess its operating expense level and to compare to financial institutions of varying sizes 
management believes the use of non gaap measures will help readers compare national penn s current results to those of prior periods as presented in the accompanying discussion 
the company s strategic plan is designed to enhance shareholder value by operating a highly profitable financial services company within the markets it serves 
specifically  management is focused on increasing market penetration in selected geographic areas and achieving excellence in both retail and commercial lines of business 
the company also grows revenue through appropriate and targeted acquisitions  through expanding into new geographical markets  or through further penetrating existing markets or business lines 
the current economic climate and interest rate environment present challenges for all financial institutions in achieving their business goals 
the company s financial performance is substantially affected by external factors beyond its control 
issues such as the length and severity of the deteriorating domestic economic climate  counterparty creditworthiness  the functioning and availability of liquidity in capital markets and consumer demand for products and services are all impacted by legislative and regulatory initiatives of the federal government 
in addition to historical information  this form k contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this document are subject to risks and uncertainty 
forward looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations by the company 
when we use words such as believe  expect  anticipate  or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
additional information concerning forward looking statements is contained in this report at item a 
risk factors  which is incorporated by reference into this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and predominant practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the discussion below outlines the company s critical accounting policies 
for additional accounting policies and details refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
allowance for loan and lease losses the methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance is considered by management to be a critical accounting policy due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the allowance 
the allowance is established through a provision for loan and lease losses provision charged as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company continually reassesses the allowance and charges off uncollectible loans against the allowance when circumstances do not warrant continuance of the loan as a viable asset 
recoveries of assets previously written off  if any  are credited to the allowance when they are received 
the allowance is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable loan and lease losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on its evaluation of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected defaults  estimated loss in event of default  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows or collateral liquidation values on impaired loans 
the process also considers historical loss experience  economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of acquired net assets in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually  which the company performs as of june th each year 
on an interim basis  the company evaluates whether circumstances are present that would indicate potential impairment of its goodwill 
these circumstances include prolonged trading value of the company s common stock relative to its book value  adverse changes in the business or legal climate  actions by regulators  or loss of key personnel 
when the company determines that these or other circumstances are present  the company tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at an interim date 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test in which the company identifies its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount  inclusive of the goodwill assigned to it 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  an indicator of goodwill impairment exists and a second step is performed to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
in the second step  the company calculates the implied value of goodwill by emulating a business combination for each reporting unit 
this step subtracts the estimated fair value of net assets in the reporting unit from the step one estimated fair value to determine the implied value of goodwill 
if the implied value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired  but if the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the difference in the consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding reduction to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s business segments are its reporting units which are community banking and other for purposes of the goodwill impairment test 
in performing its evaluation of goodwill impairment  the company makes significant judgments  particularly with respect to estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and if the second step is required  estimating the fair value of net assets 
the company evaluates each reporting unit and estimates a fair value as though it were an acquirer 
the estimates utilize historical data  cash flows  and market and industry data specific to each reporting unit 
industry and market data is used to develop material assumptions such as transaction multiples  required rates of return  control premiums  transaction costs and synergies of a transaction  and capitalization 
other intangible assets are specifically identified intangible assets created from a business combination 
core deposit intangibles represent the value of checking  savings and other acquired  low cost deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized over the lesser of the estimated lives of deposit accounts or ten years on an accelerated basis 
decreases in deposit lives may result in increased amortization and or an impairment charge 
other intangible assets also include customer lists and covenants not to compete 
these assets are amortized over the lesser of their contractual life or estimated economic life on a straight line basis 
the company s intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if circumstances are present that would indicate potential impairment 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for future tax consequences that arise from the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates 
changes in tax rates are recognized in the company s financial statements during the period they are enacted 
when a deferred tax asset or liability  or a change thereto  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  deferred tax expense or benefit is recorded within the income tax expense line of the consolidated statement of operations for purposes of determining the current period s net income 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan and lease losses  unrealized gains or losses on investment securities available for sale  tax credits  deferred and share based compensation  deferred loan fees  and net operating losses 
deferred tax assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at net realizable value 
the company performs an assessment each reporting period to evaluate the amount of deferred tax asset it is more likely than not to realize 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount of taxable income expected in future periods  as tax benefits require taxable income to be realized 
if a valuation allowance is required  the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet is reduced via a corresponding income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes the benefit of a tax position in the financial statements only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
for these analyses  the company may engage attorneys to provide opinions related to certain positions 
evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment on the part of management  as it requires evaluation of future events and outcomes based on current information 
the company s disclosures included in this report outline relevant judgments made by management with respect to the conclusions reached 
other than temporary impairment when the fair value of an investment security is less than the carrying value  the security is considered to be impaired  and as such the company reviews the security for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti 
this analysis is performed at least quarterly  and includes consideration of numerous factors including  but not limited to  the time period for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value  curtailment or suspension of dividends or cash flows  deterioration of financial performance or the creditworthiness of the issuer  the performance of any underlying collateral  and negative trends in a particular industry or sector 
the conclusion as to whether otti exists for an investment security requires judgment since it is ultimately based upon the company s evaluation of the recoverability above its carrying value and its timing 
in addition  the company considers whether it plans to sell an investment security and whether it may be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its carrying value 
when the company concludes an investment security is other than temporarily impaired  a loss for the difference between the investment security s carrying value and the fair value is recognized as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations 
for an investment in a debt security  if the company does not intend to sell the investment security and concludes that it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovering the carrying value  which may be maturity  the otti charge is separated into the credit and other components 
the other component of the otti is included in other comprehensive income  net of the tax effect  and the credit component of the otti is included as a reduction to non interest income in the consolidated statement of operations

other non interest expense totaled million  a decrease  when adjusting for the divestiture of christiana 
the efficiency ratio a non gaap measure was stable at  as continued focus on expense controls and reduced fdic insurance more than offset the increasing cost of regulatory compliance 
adjusted net income is a non gaap measure and excludes certain items which management believes affect the comparability of results between periods 
the following table reconciles the non gaap measure of adjusted net income to the gaap measure of net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share

these reductions combined with million of growth in transaction and savings accounts led to an improvement in the mix of deposits during as a result  overall funding costs improved by basis points  and the cost of deposits decreased basis points to basis points 
the trend for deposit and funding costs helped to mitigate the effect of declining yields on interest income

in addition  average earning assets decreased million during to billion at december   and contributed million to the decrease in interest income 
average loans and leases decreased to billion as economic conditions and reductions from proactive management of lower quality credits impacted loan balances  primarily commercial loans 
combined with the low interest rate environment  overall interest income from loans decreased million  of which million was attributable to declining balances throughout at december   commercial loans and leases comprised of total average loans  and a reduction to average balances resulted in a decrease to interest income of million 
approximately one third of the reduction to loans during was due to reduced exposure to commercial real estate and construction loans 
interest income on investment securities experienced a million net decrease resulting primarily from interest rate declines 
us government agency securities were most significantly impacted as maturities and repayments on these securities caused the average yield to decline from at december  to at december  the impact from the decline in interest rates was nearly offset by purchase activity which resulted in an increase in the average balance of us agency securities of million

each quarter  the company evaluates the realizability of the dta 
as of december   the company concluded that the dta was realizable  and a valuation allowance was not required 
in reaching this conclusion management carefully weighed both positive and negative evidence present 
the company has continued to demonstrate increased profitability and performance in line with projections  and it has also utilized its nol carry forwards as planned 
therefore  management believes that the dta continues to be realizable 
if there are substantial  adverse economic developments that deteriorate credit quality or profitability  the judgments made regarding the company s ability to utilize the dta may change 
this would result in additional income tax expense being recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
these types of events or a valuation allowance would impact regulatory capital by the amount of the dta included in regulatory capital 
liquidity  commitments  capital and interest rate sensitivity liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations the company s board of directors establishes general liquidity guidelines to ensure adequate liquidity to fulfill obligations 
obligations for liquidity include depositors who wish to withdraw funds  borrowers who require funds  operating expenditures  and capital expansion 
sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
management continues to actively monitor and manage liquidity and current available funding channels to ensure an appropriate contingency funding strategy plan is in place 
the company s largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from retail  corporate and institutional banking deposit customers 
the company also utilizes wholesale funding that comes from a mix of short and long term funding providers 
wholesale funding includes correspondent bank borrowings  secured borrowing lines from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb  the federal reserve bank of philadelphia frb and  at times  brokered cds 
the company s principal source of day to day liquidity is its liquid cash reserve on hand generated from core deposit operations 
when demand exceeds this reserve and normal deposit gathering efforts  funds are obtained through wholesale channels 
the company reduced its wholesale funding as funds continue to be available at reasonable rates  and dependence on borrowings has been reduced

as a result  the company s largest source of revenue is net interest income  which subjects it to movements in market interest rates 
management s objective for interest rate risk management is to understand the company s susceptibility to changes in interest rates and develop and implement strategies to minimize volatility while maximizing net interest income 
the board of directors establishes policies that govern interest rate risk management 
this is accomplished via a centralized asset liability management committee alco 
alco is comprised of various members of the company s business lines who are responsible for managing the components of interest rate risk timing differences between contractual maturities and or repricing of assets and liabilities gap risk  risk that assets will repay or customers withdraw prior to contractual maturity option risk  non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve yield curve risk  and variation in rate movements of different indices basis risk 
alco employs various techniques and instruments to implement its developed strategies 
these generally include one or more of the following changes to interest rates offered on products  changes to maturity terms offered on products  changes to types of products offered  and or use of wholesale products such as advances from the fhlb or interest rate swaps 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
minimizing the balance sheet s maturity and repricing risk is a continual focus in a changing rate environment 
the company uses a simulation model to identify and manage its interest rate risk profile 
the model measures projected net interest income at risk and anticipated changes in net income for a rolling twelve month period 
the model is based on expected cash flows and repricing characteristics for all financial instruments at a point in time and incorporates company developed  market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on these financial instruments 
the company also incorporates assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
while actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies  this model is an important guidance tool for alco 
the following table demonstrates the anticipated impact of a parallel interest rate shift on the company s net interest income for the subsequent twelve months dollars in thousands change in interest rates change in net interest income in basis points december  december  n a n a certain short term interest rates are currently below 
therefore  in a scenario where interest rates decline by basis points  short term interest rates decline to zero  resulting in a non parallel downward shift 
in this interest rate scenario  net interest income is simulated to decline for the subsequent twelve months by and based upon net interest income for december  and  respectively 
as measured by the net interest income analysis  the company reflects an asset sensitive risk profile and would benefit over the next twelve months by an increase in interest rates 
the results of the net interest income analysis fall within the compliance guidelines established by alco and the board of directors
