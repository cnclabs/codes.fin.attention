item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of factors that affect the comparability of the selected financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and general our discussions below in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
we are engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  cobalt  titanium  manganese  chromium  molybdenum  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire and narrow strip in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders 
our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico  europe and asia allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
we are also a manufacturer and service provider of high precision components for measurement while drilling mwd and logging while drilling lwd  drill collars  stabilizers and other down hole tools used for directional drilling 
mwd and lwd technology is used to ensure critical data is obtained and transmitted to the surface to monitor progress of the well 
on february   following approval by the us federal trade commission ftc  we completed the acquisition of latrobe specialty metals  inc latrobe through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into latrobe the latrobe acquisition 
in connection with the latrobe acquisition  former owners of latrobe received million shares of carpenter stock 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the related merger agreement  carpenter paid million in cash at closing  net of million of cash acquired  in addition to a payment of approximately million in order to pay off latrobe debt 
a key benefit of the latrobe acquisition is a substantial increase in production which will increase carpenter s capacity to meet strong customer demand for premium products 
as a condition of the ftc approval  carpenter entered into a consent decree the consent decree to transfer certain assets and technical knowledge to eramet s 
a and its subsidiaries  aubert duval and brown europe collectively  the transferees  which will allow the transferees  as a group  to become a second manufacturer of two specific alloys in order to provide customers with a supply alternative in the marketplace 
the alloys have minimal sales impact and will cause no material change to the economics of the latrobe acquisition 
as part of the consent decrees  we agreed to transfer certain assets as well as fund the cost of acquiring assets in an amount up to approximately million  we recorded a charge for this liability in the quarter ended march  in the first quarter of fiscal year  we announced our plans to construct a new  square foot state of the art manufacturing facility in response to strong customer demand for premium products primarily in the fast growing aerospace and defense and energy industries 
we expect that the new facility will ultimately be capable of producing approximately  tons per year of additional premium product and be operational by april we began construction of the facility on a acre greenfield site located in limestone county  alabama at a total cost of approximately million 
the site selection process included analyzing state  county and local incentives  utility costs  and labor resources 
the state of alabama and local government entities put together a compelling package  including various tax initiatives  infrastructure grants  and training programs 
the new facility will include forge  remelting and associated finishing and testing capabilities and will play a key role in further developing our capabilities in the production of our premium products 

table of contents as part of our overall business strategy  we have sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic acquisitions and joint collaborations as well possible business unit dispositions aimed at broadening our offering to the marketplace 
we have participated with other companies to explore potential terms and structure of such opportunities and we expect that we will continue to evaluate these opportunities 
business trends selected financial results for the past three fiscal years are summarized below fiscal year in millions  except per share data net sales net sales excluding surcharges operating income excluding pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension eid expense net income diluted earnings per share net pension expense per diluted share purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow pounds sold in thousands see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
during fiscal year  we changed the manner in which sales are classified by end use market so that we could better evaluate our sales results from period to period 
in order to make the discussion of sales by end use market more meaningful  we have reclassified the fiscal year and sales by end use market to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year in millions aerospace and defense industrial and consumer energy medical transportation distribution total net sales 
table of contents during fiscal year  we changed the manner in which sales are classified by product class so that we could better evaluate our sales results from period to period 
the changes are intended to better segregate growth areas of premium products such as high temperature nickel based special alloys  titanium products and powder metals  while also reflecting the anticipated product classes and businesses gained through the latrobe acquisition 
in order to make the discussion of sales by product class more meaningful  we have reclassified the fiscal year and sales by product class to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products alloy tool steel powder metals distribution other total net sales impact of raw material prices and product mix we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw materials to the sale of the processed finished goods to the customers 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
conversely  in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 
the volatility of the costs of raw materials has impacted our operations over the past several years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass cost increases on major raw materials through to our customers using surcharges that are structured to recover increases in raw material costs 
generally  the formula used to calculate a surcharge is based on published prices of the respective raw materials for the previous month which correlates to the prices we pay for our raw material purchases 
however  a portion of our surcharges to customers may be calculated using a different surcharge formula or may be based on the raw material prices at the time of order  which creates a lag between surcharge revenue and corresponding raw material costs recognized in costs of sales 
the surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales except for the lag effect discussed above 
however  surcharges have had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this report 
approximately percent our net sales are sales to customers under firm price sales arrangements 
firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations  particularly when raw material prices are volatile 
in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales  we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the related products sold 
firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are established 
if a customer fails to meet the volume commitments or the consumption schedule deviates from the agreed upon terms of the firm price sales arrangements  the company may need to absorb the gains or losses associated with the commodity forward contracts on a temporary basis 
gains or losses associated with commodity forward contracts are reclassified to earnings loss when earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction 
because we value most of our inventory under the lifo costing methodology  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period attempting to match the most recently incurred costs with revenues 
gains or losses on the commodity forward contracts are reclassified from other 
table of contents comprehensive income together with the actual purchase price of the underlying commodities when the underlying commodities are purchased and recorded in inventory 
to the extent that the total purchase price of the commodities  inclusive of the gains or losses on the commodity forward contracts  are higher or lower relative to the beginning of year costs  our costs of goods sold reflect such amounts 
accordingly  the gains and or losses associated with commodity forward contracts may not impact the same period that the firm price sales arrangements revenue is recognized  and comparisons of gross profit from period to period may be impacted 
these firm price sales arrangements are expected to continue as we look to strengthen our long term customer relationships by expanding  renewing and in certain cases extending to a longer term  our customer long term arrangements 
we produce hundreds of grades of materials  with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade 
in addition  our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make on participation in certain products based on available capacity including the impacts of capacity commitments we may have under existing customer agreements 
while we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time  the impact by period may fluctuate  and period to period comparisons may vary 
net pension expense net pension expense  as we define it below  includes the net periodic benefit costs related to both our pension and other postretirement plans 
see further discussion of net pension expense in the non gaap financial measures below 
net pension expense is recorded in accounts that are included in both the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of our statements of income 
the fiscal year net pension expense includes million of net pension expense associated the pension and postretirement plans assumed in connection with the latrobe acquisition 
the following is a summary of the classification of net pension expense included in our statements of income during fiscal years  and fiscal year in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses net pension expense net pension expense is determined annually based on beginning of year balances  and is recorded ratably throughout the fiscal year  unless a significant re measurement event occurs 
the following is a summary of the components of net pension expense during fiscal years  and fiscal year in millions service cost pension earnings  interest and deferrals net pension expense the service cost component of net pension expense represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees 
the pension earnings  interest and deferrals expense is comprised of the expected return on plan assets  interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans  and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs 
pension earnings  interest and deferrals expenses is impacted by the financial markets and decreased significantly during fiscal year principally due to the increase in market value of the securities held by the plans as well as slightly higher interest rates as of june  
table of contents latrobe acquisition impacts we closed the latrobe acquisition on february  the latrobe business is already accretive to earnings  excluding the transaction costs and short term impacts associated with fair value cost adjustments in connection with the acquisition accounting 
the following is a summary of the impacts that the latrobe acquisition has had on our results 
the measures below have not been determined in accordance with us gaap 
see further discussion of these measures in the non gaap financial measures discussion below 
fiscal year per diluted share net income attributable to carpenter before adjusted latrobe operating results  share dilution and total acquisition related costs adjusted latrobe operating results dilution from additional outstanding shares net income attributable to carpenter before total acquisition related costs total acquisition related costs net income attributable to carpenter detailed schedule included in non gaap financial measures below 
in connection with the latrobe acquisition  we issued million shares of common stock to the former owners 
for the fiscal year  the issuance of these shares resulted in an additional million weighted average diluted shares 
operating performance overview fiscal year results reflect the benefits of strong  sustained demand across all our end use markets 
we have made progress during fiscal year in the following important areas we exceeded our financial goals based on solid execution against our strategies of premium product growth  mix management and pricing 
we finalized our acquisition of latrobe 
the integration process is going extremely well and we are even more excited about the strategic value and synergies from this transaction 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared with income of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
our fiscal year results reflect a trend of improving revenues and profit throughout the fiscal year 
net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which was a percent increase from fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  sales were percent higher than fiscal year on percent higher volume 
geographically  sales outside the united states increased percent from fiscal year to million 
international sales as a percentage of our total net sales  represented percent and percent for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 

table of contents sales by end use markets we sell to customers across diversified end use markets 
the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales  which includes surcharge revenues  by principal end use markets which we believe is helpful supplemental information in analyzing the performance of the business from period to period fiscal year increase increase in millions decrease decrease aerospace and defense industrial and consumer energy medical transportation distribution total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by the same principal end use markets  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year in millions increase increase aerospace and defense industrial and consumer energy medical transportation distribution total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales to the aerospace and defense market increased percent from fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
the aerospace and defense results reflect strength in all areas as build rates remain high and mix shifts to larger planes and new platforms that favor higher use of our products as well as the addition of the latrobe business during fiscal year industrial and consumer market sales decreased percent from fiscal year to million 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased approximately percent while volumes decreased percent 
the results reflect the continued impact of mix management and pricing actions 
the percentage of volume in differentiated product applications with strategically important customers continues to increase as a result of these actions 
sales to the energy market of million reflected a percent increase from fiscal year excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
the sales results reflect the growth led by oil and gas which continues to benefit from the amega west acquisition which is leading to share gains and international expansion 
directional rig activity remains high with increased offshore drilling and movement of rigs from gas to oil 

table of contents sales to the medical market increased percent to million from fiscal year adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent  while volumes increased percent 
the overall volume growth is consistent with expected long term industry growth rates 
the higher growth is attributable to customer shifts to tighter specification medical grade alloys which creates increased demand for carpenter premium products 
transportation market sales increased percent from the fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent lower shipment volume 
revenue growth far exceeded volume growth which reflects carpenter s focus on higher value material solutions to increase fuel efficiency and lightweight vehicles 
sales to the distribution market increased percent to million from fiscal year the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of latrobe distribution business which globally sources and distributes corrosion resistant steels  tool steels and powder metals for a wide range of industries 
sales by product class the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by major product class fiscal year in millions increase increase special alloys stainless steels titanium products powder metals alloy and tool steel distribution and other total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by the same major product class  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year in millions increase increase special alloys stainless steels titanium products powder metals alloy and tool steel distribution and other total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales of special alloys products increased percent in fiscal year as compared with a year ago to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  sales increased percent on a percent increase in shipment volume 
the sales results principally reflect the increased demand in our higher value alloys used in the aerospace and energy markets as wells as the positive impacts of our mix management initiatives 
sales of stainless steels increased percent as compared with fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  such sales increased by percent on a percent lower shipment volume 
the results reflect the benefits of strengthening product mix and pricing actions in the energy  medical  industrial  automotive and consumer markets 

table of contents sales of titanium products increased percent as compared with fiscal year on percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect the benefits of shifts in product mix to higher value materials used in medical applications as well as the impacts of strengthening demand for aerospace fasteners 
sales of powder metals increased percent in fiscal year on percent lower shipment volume 
the results reflect unfavorable performance in europe  offset by pricing and mix management efforts 
sales of alloy and tool steel increased percent in fiscal year on percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect the addition of the latrobe business 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal year increased to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  from million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  for fiscal year the results primarily reflect the higher volumes in fiscal year  an improved product mix  price increases and better operating performance 
our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs  although generally with a lag effect 
while the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars  it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales 
the following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharges on gross margin for fiscal years and see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial metrics 
fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges gross profit gross margin gross margin excluding dilutive effect of surcharges selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  compared to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year is due principally to the additional overhead costs related to the latrobe and amega businesses and the impact of general inflationary increases in costs 
acquisition related costs in connection with the latrobe acquisition  we incurred approximately million of acquisition related costs during fiscal year these costs represent direct incremental legal  accounting and investment banking fees incurred in connection with the latrobe acquisition as well as approximately million of liability for costs associated with the sale of certain latrobe assets necessary to obtain ftc approval for the transaction 

table of contents during fiscal year  we incurred million of acquisition related costs associated with the latrobe and amega west acquisitions 
these costs consist primarily of fees paid to financial  legal and other professional advisors in connection with the acquisition activities 
operating income our operating income in fiscal year increased to million as compared with million in fiscal year operating income has been significantly impacted by our pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension eid portion of our net pension expense  which may be volatile based on conditions in the financial markets 
the following presents our operating income and operating margin  in each case excluding the impact of surcharges on net sales and excluding the impacts of pension eid expense and acquisition related costs from operating income 
we present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of volatile and restructuring charges provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges operating income add back pension eid expense operating income excluding pension eid expense acquisition related costs from transaction operating income excluding pension eid expense and acquisition related costs from transaction operating margin excluding surcharges and pension eid expense operating margin excluding surcharges and pension eid expense and acquisition related costs from transaction in addition to the impact of the surcharge mechanism and pension eid expense  fluctuations in raw material prices combined with fluctuations in inventory levels and the lag effect of the surcharge mechanism have impacted our operating income from year to year 
we estimate that the effect of such combined fluctuations negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year and negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year interest expense fiscal year interest expense of million increased percent from million in fiscal year the increase in interest expense  excluding the gains on interest swaps  reflects the net impact of a higher debt level albeit at a lower average interest rate 
interest on substantially all of our debt was at a fixed rate 
we have used interest rate swaps to achieve a level of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt where appropriate 
fiscal year interest expense includes net gains from interest rate swaps of million as compared with net gains from the interest rate swaps of million in fiscal year 
table of contents other income  net other income for fiscal year was million as compared with million a year ago 
the decrease principally reflected less receipts from the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of  unfavorable market return on company owned life insurance and lower equity in earnings of our joint ventures 
income taxes our effective tax rate income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes for fiscal year was percent as compared to percent in fiscal year the fiscal year tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the nondeductible expenses related to the latrobe acquisition 
the fiscal year tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the benefits associated with foreign source income  the domestic manufacturing deduction and the research and development credit
