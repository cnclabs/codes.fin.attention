item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
we experienced uneven industry conditions in as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment  which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions and customer and consumer confidence 
in emerging markets  high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions 
our tire unit shipments in were essentially flat compared to  and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict 
in addition  our raw material costs rose by approximately in compared to we acted to address the uncertain economic environment and the challenges described above by implementing strategic initiatives aimed at permitting us to emerge stronger in the future 
under those strategic initiatives we planned to continue to focus on consumer driven product development  take a selective approach to the market  targeting profitable segments where we have competitive advantages  focus on price and product mix improvements to address rising raw material costs  achieve cost reductions of billion over three years from to improve our manufacturing efficiency  including recovering unabsorbed fixed costs incurred during the recession  focus on cash flow to provide funding for investments in future growth  and create an advantaged supply chain focused on optimizing inventory levels and further improving customer service 
in spite of the macroeconomic and industry specific challenges we faced  we produced record net sales and segment operating income in during  improved price and product mix of nearly billion more than offset the impact of unprecedented raw material cost increases of nearly billion on segment operating income  exclusive of approximately million of raw material cost savings included in our cost savings plan described below 
price and product mix also drove a improvement in revenue per tire  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  in compared to  reflecting our continued focus on driving improved price and product mix through innovative product offerings in targeted market segments 
in  we realized approximately million of cost savings  bringing the total cost savings for and to approximately million 
our cost savings plan includes savings from continuous improvement initiatives  including net savings under our united steelworkers contract  increased low cost country sourcing  and initiatives to reduce raw material costs and selling  administrative and general expense 
we also recovered approximately million of under absorbed fixed overhead costs in compared to other key strategic achievements include continued progress on actions to reduce our high cost manufacturing capacity  including the closure of our factory in union city  tennessee in july  initiated production of tires at our new factory in pulandian  china  and continued improvements in working capital efficiency  measured as a percent of sales 
for the year ended december   goodyear net income was million  compared to a goodyear net loss of million in  and goodyear net income available to common shareholders was million  compared to a goodyear net loss available to common shareholders of million in our total segment operating income for was  million  compared to million in the increase in segment operating income was due primarily to strong price and product mix which more than offset raw material costs  a significant decrease in under absorbed fixed overhead costs due to increased production volumes  and favorable foreign currency translation 
see results of operations segment information for additional information 
net sales were billion in  compared to billion in net sales increased due to improved price and product mix  an increase in other tire related businesses  primarily in north american tire s third party sales of chemical products  and favorable foreign currency translation  primarily in emea and asia pacific tire 
pension and benefit plans during  our us pension plans experienced actuarial losses from decreases in discount rates  which increased plan obligations by million 
in addition  the actual return on plan assets for our us pension fund in was million less than the expected return 
these results increased actuarial net losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl by 
table of contents million 
as a result  annual us net periodic pension cost will increase to approximately million to million in from million in  due primarily to amortization of higher net actuarial losses from aocl 
liquidity at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as well as  million of unused availability under our various credit agreements  compared to  million and  million  respectively  at december  cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the improvement in earnings compared to  the net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock of million  and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of  million  the redemption of million of our senior notes due  and working capital expenditures of million 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
new products in  we successfully launched our new goodyear assurance tripletred all season  goodyear ultra grip ice wrt and kelly safari atr tire lines in north american tire 
we also successfully launched nine new tire and retread product lines in our commercial truck tire business with three of those lines featuring smartway fuel efficiency certification and or duraseal technology 
at our north american tire dealer conference in early  we introduced several key products  most notably the goodyear assurance cs tripletred all season and the eagle f asymmetric all season 
additionally  we are adding key sizes of new consumer products launched in recent years 
in emea  we launched the new eagle f asymmetric summer ultra high performance tire and the goodyear ultra grip and dunlop winter sport d winter tires 
we have also strengthened our max technology commercial tire line up with a new regional haul trailer tire  rhtii  and a new line of higher load range tires that offer increased load capacity 
in addition  we have upgraded our fuel max line with our lhs ii and lhd ii tires 
in latin american tire  we successfully launched the wrangler mt r with kevlar in the consumer market 
we also launched several products using fuel max technology in the commercial market  as well as expanded our commercial product lines by adding key sizes of new commercial products launched in recent years 
in asia pacific tire  we launched two of our leading ultra high performance tires  the goodyear eagle f asymmetric for luxury sports performance vehicles and the goodyear eagle f directional for mid range sports performance vehicles 
both of these goodyear eagle products are successors to previous award winning ultra high performance tires and provide superior braking and handling capabilities 
outlook in  we expect to continue to face challenges related to uneven tire industry growth and the actions we are taking globally to improve our manufacturing footprint 
we expect long term growth in the global tire industry to continue  but at a slower pace near term than previously forecast due to continued economic weakness in several parts of the world  most notably in europe 
we expect that our full year tire unit volume for will be essentially flat with for the full year of in north america  we expect consumer replacement to be flat to down  consumer original equipment to be flat to up  commercial replacement to be up between and and commercial original equipment to be up between and 
for the full year in europe  the consumer replacement industry is expected to be flat to down  consumer original equipment to be down between and  commercial replacement to be down between and and commercial original equipment to be down between and 

table of contents we expect our raw material costs in the first quarter of to increase to when compared with the first quarter of smaller increases are expected for the second quarter of compared with the second quarter of for the second half of  we expect raw material costs to decrease compared with the second half of for the full year of  we expect our raw material costs will increase approximately compared with however  natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices have experienced significant volatility  and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials 
in order to mitigate some of the impact of rising raw material costs  we are continuing to focus on price and product mix  to substitute lower cost materials where possible and to work to identify additional substitution opportunities  to reduce the amount of material required in each tire  and to pursue alternative raw materials including innovative bio based materials 
however  during periods of rapidly rising raw material costs  we may not be able to fully offset those raw material cost increases through the use of these strategies  although we remain confident in our ability to do so over the longer term 
as a result of the closure of our union city  tennessee manufacturing facility  we now expect to recover approximately million to million of unabsorbed fixed costs in  net of the impact of anticipated production cuts due to flat tire unit volume 
we also expect to reduce costs by approximately million in as a partial offset to these benefits  we expect to incur approximately million to million of additional costs related to start up expenses for our new pulandian  china manufacturing facility and under absorbed overhead costs related to the closure of our dalian  china manufacturing facility in see item a

results of operations segment information segment information reflects our strategic business units sbus  which are organized to meet customer requirements and global competition and are segmented on a regional basis 
results of operations are measured based on net sales to unaffiliated customers and segment operating income 
each segment exports tires to other segments 
the financial results of each segment exclude sales of tires exported to other segments  but include operating income derived from such transactions 
segment operating income is computed as follows net sales less cgs excluding asset write off and accelerated depreciation charges and sag including certain allocated corporate administrative expenses 
segment operating income also includes certain royalties and equity in earnings of most affiliates 
segment operating income does not include net rationalization charges credits  asset sales and certain other items 
total segment operating income was  million in  million in and million in total segment operating margin segment operating income divided by segment sales in was  compared to in and in management believes that total segment operating income is useful because it represents the aggregate value of income created by our sbus and excludes items not directly related to the sbus for performance evaluation purposes

oe volume decreased by million units  or  primarily in the consumer business and replacement volume decreased by million units  or 
decreases in oe unit sales were primarily caused by supply disruptions at oe manufacturers as a result of the natural disaster in japan as well as flooding in thailand 
declines in replacement unit sales in australia and new zealand  which were affected by a continued weak retail environment  and in thailand  which was impacted by flooding  more than offset increased replacement unit sales in china and india

in addition  operating income excluded net gains on asset sales of million in  due primarily to the sale of land in malaysia  and million in  due primarily to the sale of a closed manufacturing facility in taiwan and land in thailand 
asia pacific tire s results are highly dependent upon australia  which accounted for approximately and of asia pacific tire s net sales in and  respectively 
accordingly  results of operations in australia will have a significant impact on asia pacific tire s future performance 
in  start up expenses at our new manufacturing facility in pulandian  china and under absorbed overhead costs at our dalian  china manufacturing facility that is expected to be closed in the second half of are anticipated to adversely impact asia pacific tire s operating income by million to million compared to following severe flooding in thailand  we closed our consumer and aviation tire manufacturing facility in bangkok in october the floodwaters that idled the plant receded in late november  allowing us to make an assessment of the damage 
in addition to the approximate million impact on segment operating income  we recorded charges of million during the fourth quarter of in other expense  representing our deductible under an insurance policy 
in the aggregate  our fourth quarter results of operations were negatively affected by approximately million million after tax  or per share 
restoration of our facility has commenced and we expect to resume production of aviation and consumer tires during the first quarter  ramping up to full production during the second quarter 
as a result  we expect our first half of production and sales to be adversely affected 
over time  we do not expect the impact on our results of operations to be material due to available insurance coverage  however  the timing of recognition of insurance recoveries may lag the recording of incurred losses

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 
general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
at december   we estimate that it is reasonably possible that our gross liabilities  net of our estimate for probable insurance recoveries  could exceed our recorded amounts by approximately million 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements  and also have excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers  the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors 
as of december   we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  the recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to us workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  and workers compensation  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 

table of contents recoverability of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
goodwill totaled million at december  we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in fasb accounting standard update no 
intangibles goodwill and other topics was issued in september and allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative assessment should be performed 
we adopted this standard update in the third quarter in connection with our july  annual impairment assessment and performed a qualitative analysis 
after considering changes to assumptions used in the prior year test  including the capital markets environment  global economic conditions  tire industry competition and trends  and improvements in our results of operations  as well as the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our annual testing of for north american tire  over for emea and over for asia pacific tire  and other factors  we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was not less than its carrying value and  therefore  did not perform a quantitative analysis 
accordingly  the annual impairment test at july  indicated there was no impairment of goodwill 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
we derecognize tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods  or that we are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 income taxes 
pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  inflation rates  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends 
the discount rate for our us plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa 
table of contents or higher as of december and is reviewed annually 
our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over a period of years or more  estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation 
actual us pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was and  respectively  at december   compared to and for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  at december  the decrease in the discount rate at december  was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds 
interest cost included in our us net periodic pension cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was million in  compared to million in and million in the following table presents the sensitivity of our us projected pension benefit obligation  accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation  shareholders equity  and expense to the indicated increase decrease in key assumptions change at december  dollars in millions change pbo abo equity expense pensions assumption discount rate actual return on assets n a expected return on assets n a n a other postretirement benefits assumption discount rate health care cost trends total cost a significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of  million in our us pension plans as of december  is a result of plan asset losses and the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
for purposes of determining our us net periodic pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of the net actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in before it begins to gradually decline 
the actual rate of return on our us pension fund was  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the expected rate of for all three years 
we use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our us pension plans 
we experienced a decrease in our us discount rate at the end of and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
the net actuarial loss increased from due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  for purposes of determining worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost  we recognized million of the net actuarial losses in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in before it begins to gradually decline 
the weighted average amortization period for our us plans is approximately years

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities 
our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital 
we experienced uneven industry conditions in as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment  which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions 
in emerging markets  high inflation and interest rates also contributed to uneven industry conditions 
in  we took several actions to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity  including the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock  the redemption of a portion of our senior notes due with the proceeds of that equity offering  the refinancing of our european revolving credit facility and the issuance of euro denominated notes by gdte 
at december   we had solid liquidity  with approximately billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused availability under our credit facilities 
for further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million were partially offset by working capital expenditures of million 
higher raw material costs and increased selling prices drove the increase in working capital  while higher inventory units to support customer service levels and weaker industry sales in the fourth quarter  primarily in emea  also contributed 
for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million and net cash provided by financing activities was million 
cash and cash equivalents were favorably affected by the net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock of million and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due partially offsetting these increases in cash and cash equivalents were capital expenditures of  million and the redemption of million of our senior notes due at december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of unused availability under our various credit agreements 
the table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of december in millions first lien revolving credit facility european revolving credit facility chinese credit facilities other domestic and international debt notes payable and overdrafts at december   our unused availability included million that can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in china 
these credit facilities  along with government grants  should provide funding for most of the cost related to the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities at december  we have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions 
we seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits  credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions  by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads  and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis 
we also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible 
by controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner  we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution 
however  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution 
our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit  or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs 

table of contents in  we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million to million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion 
we also expect interest expense to range between million and million and  when and if future dividends are declared  dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock to be million 
we intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations 
the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of the pension relief act provides funding relief for defined benefit pension plan sponsors by deferring near term contributions 
as allowed by the pension relief act  we elected funding relief for the and plan years 
funding relief delays certain funding requirements for the elected plan years to years after and is expected to reduce our total us pension contributions in to by approximately million to million 
current low interest rates have increased our funding requirements  thereby offsetting much of the benefit provided by funding relief 
we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded us pension plans of approximately million to million in and million to million in if the current low interest rate environment continues without funding stabilization legislation  we will experience additional increases in our funding obligations in for additional information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations commitments and contingent liabilities 
sri has certain minority exit rights that  if triggered and exercised  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sri s interests in gdte and gdtna following the determination of the fair value of sri s interests 
for further information regarding our global alliance with sri  including the events that could trigger sri s exit rights  see item business 
description of goodyear s business global alliance 
as of the date of this filing  sri has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable 
our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent  in part  on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group  whether in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
in certain countries where we operate  such as china  venezuela  and south africa  transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends  loans  advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements  such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country 
in addition  certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash 
thus  we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt 
because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations  we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries  including our chinese  venezuelan and south african subsidiaries  that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements 
at december   approximately million of net assets  including million of cash and cash equivalents  were subject to such requirements  including million of cash in venezuela 
the requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of china and south africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries 
effective january   venezuela s economy was considered to be highly inflationary under us generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of over the latest three year period  based upon the blended consumer price index and national consumer price index 
accordingly  the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiary 
all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since january  were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in other expense 
venezuela remained a highly inflationary economy for us gaap purposes during on january   venezuela established a two tier exchange rate structure for essential and non essential goods 
for essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar and for non essential goods the official exchange rate was bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
on january   the two tier exchange rate structure was eliminated 
for our unsettled amounts at december  and going forward  the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar is expected to be used for substantially all goods 

table of contents the million foreign currency exchange loss in the first quarter of primarily consisted of a million remeasurement loss on bolivar denominated net monetary assets and liabilities  including deferred taxes  at the time of the january devaluation 
the loss was primarily related to cash deposits in venezuela that were remeasured at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to non essential goods  and was partially offset by a million subsidy receivable related to us dollar denominated payables that were expected to be settled at the official subsidy exchange rate of bolivares fuertes applicable to essential goods 
since we expected these payables to be settled at the subsidy essential goods rate  we established a subsidy receivable to reflect the expected benefit to be received in the form of the difference between the essential and non essential goods exchange rates 
throughout  we periodically assessed our ability to realize the benefit of the subsidy receivable  and a substantial portion of purchases by our venezuelan subsidiary had qualified and settled at the official exchange rate for essential goods 
as a result of the elimination of the official subsidy exchange rate for essential goods  we recorded a foreign exchange loss of million in the fourth quarter of related to the reversal of the subsidy receivable at december  if in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised  we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million  which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of intercompany payables  including million of dividends  million of accounts payable trade  million of compensation and benefits and million of income taxes payable 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million  which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of intercompany payables  including million of dividends  million of accounts payable trade and million of compensation and benefits 
all monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at bolivares fuertes to the us dollar at december  and goodyear venezuela s sales were and of our net sales for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
goodyear venezuela s cost of goods sold was and of our cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
goodyear venezuela s sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately us dollar denominated 
a further decrease in the bolivar fuerte against the us dollar would decrease goodyear venezuela s sales and increase cost of goods sold by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  on an annual basis 
during the twelve months ended december   goodyear venezuela settled million and million  respectively  of us dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade 
for the twelve months ended december   of those payables were settled at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar and were settled at the essential goods rate of bolivar fuertes to the us dollar 
at december   settlements of us dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were million  all of which are expected to settle at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
at december   million of the requested settlements were pending up to days  less than million were pending from to days and million were pending over one year 
amounts pending up to days include imported tires and raw materials of million and dividends payable of million  and amounts pending over one year include dividends payable of million  imported tires of million and intercompany charges for royalties of million 
currency exchange controls in venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from venezuela 
goodyear venezuela contributed a significant portion of latin american tire s sales and operating income in and the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte against the us dollar in january and weak economic conditions and operational disruptions in venezuela adversely impacted latin american tire s operating income in we continue to face operational challenges in venezuela  including inflationary cost pressures  high absenteeism  and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods 
in response to conditions in venezuela  we continue to evaluate the need to adjust prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges  including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires 
our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material and other production costs  market demand and adherence to government price controls 
for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations  including venezuela  see item a 
risk factors 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
if market opportunities exist  we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position  which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions 
however  the challenges we face may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital

covenant compliance our amended and restated first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities and some of the indentures governing our notes contain certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock  make certain restricted payments or investments  incur liens  sell assets  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  enter into affiliate transactions  engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
these covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications 
we have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable 
we only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur 
these financial covenants and related events are as follows we become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our parent company and guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents available cash plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than million 
if this were to occur  our ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december   our availability under this facility of  million  plus our available cash of  million  totaled billion  which is in excess of million 
we become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales 
the covenant provides that  before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien  senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness  we must first offer to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of consolidated net secured indebtedness to ebitda pro forma senior secured leverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than to in addition  our amended and restated european revolving credit facility contains non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to gdte and its subsidiaries 
this financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow gdte s ratio of consolidated net jv indebtedness to consolidated european jv ebitda for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
consolidated net jv indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by gdte and its subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by the parent company and its us subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met 
consolidated net jv indebtedness also excludes loans from other consolidated goodyear entities 
this financial covenant is also included in our pan european accounts receivable securitization facility 
at december   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if  after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment  our ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed to certain of our senior note indentures 
table of contents have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments 
our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above 
we believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating  investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test 
there are no known future changes to  or new covenants in  any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above 
covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility  or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt 
as of december   we were in compliance with the currently applicable material covenants imposed by our principal credit facilities and indentures 
the terms available cash  ebitda  consolidated interest expense  consolidated net secured indebtedness  pro forma senior secured leverage ratio  consolidated net jv indebtedness and consolidated european jv ebitda have the meanings given them in the respective credit facilities 
potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock as long as no default will have occurred and be continuing  additional indebtedness can be incurred under the credit facilities following the payment  and certain financial tests are satisfied 
so long as any of our mandatory convertible preferred stock is outstanding  no dividend  except a dividend payable in shares of our common stock  or other shares ranking junior to the mandatory convertible preferred stock  may be paid or declared or any distribution be made on shares of our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the then outstanding mandatory convertible preferred stock payable on all dividend payment dates occurring on or prior to the date of such action have been declared and paid or sufficient funds have been set aside for that payment 
asset dispositions the restrictions on asset sales imposed by our material indebtedness have not affected our strategy of divesting non core businesses  and those divestitures have not affected our ability to comply with those restrictions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate  foreign exchange and commodity price risks 
we have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power  expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing

the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined using current market pricing models 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements  and forecasted purchases and sales 
contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation
