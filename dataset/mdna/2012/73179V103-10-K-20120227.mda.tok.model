overview we are a leading global high technology filtration company that develops  manufactures and markets specialized microporous membranes used in separation and filtration processes 
in fiscal  we generated total net sales of million 
we operate in two primary businesses energy storage and separations media 
we manufacture our products at facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from foreign locations were million for fiscal since august  we have initiated significant capacity expansions in all of our businesses 
capacity from these expansions started to come online during and will continue to come online throughout and we believe long term demand drivers in our businesses remain positive  and we will continue to assess capacity needs and make investments to capitalize on these future growth opportunities 
energy storage in the energy storage business  our membrane separators are a critical performance component in lithium batteries  which are primarily used in consumer electronics and electric drive vehicle edv applications  and lead acid batteries  which are used globally in transportation and numerous industrial applications 
we believe that the long term growth drivers for the energy storage business growth in asia  strong demand for consumer electronics and growing demand for edvs are positive 
the energy storage business is comprised of two reportable segments  as described below 
electronics and edvs 
lithium batteries are the power source in a wide variety of applications  including consumer electronics applications such as notebook computers  tablets  mobile phones and cordless power tools  edvs  and emerging applications such as energy storage systems ess 

table of contents growth in lithium batteries is being driven by demand in consumer electronics and edvs 
a summary of our lithium capacity expansions is as follows facility estimated cost millions actual or expected start up time target applications charlotte  nc concord  nc st quarter mid edv charlotte  nc year end edv concord  nc late edv concord  nc late edv ochang  korea rd quarter consumer electronics start up time is based on when production of commercial quality product begins  which is typically followed by a three to nine month qualification period  depending on  among other factors  customer resources and qualification timing 
partially funded by a million grant from the us department of energy doe 
transportation and industrial 
in the lead acid battery market  the high proportion of aftermarket replacement sales and the steady growth of the worldwide fleet of motor vehicles provide us with a growing recurring revenue base in lead acid battery separators 
worldwide demand for lead acid battery separators is expected to continue to grow at slightly more than annual economic growth 
the asia pacific region is the fastest growing market for lead acid battery separators 
growth in this region is driven by the increasing penetration of automobile ownership  growth in industrial and manufacturing sectors  export incentives and ongoing conversion to the polyethylene based membrane separators we produce 
we have positioned ourselves to benefit from growth in asia by expanding capacity at our prachinburi  thailand facility  acquiring battery separator manufacturing assets and subsequently expanding our operations in bangalore  india  acquiring a production facility in tianjin  china  establishing an asian technical center in thailand  and entering into a joint venture with a customer  camel group co  ltd 
camel  to produce lead acid battery separators in china  that is expected to start production in mid in february  we started an additional expansion at our prachinburi  thailand facility that is expected to begin production in the second half of separations media in the separations media business  our filtration membranes and modules are used in healthcare and high performance filtration and specialty applications 
we believe that the separations media business will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand for higher levels of purity in a growing number of applications 
the separations media business is a reportable segment 
for healthcare applications  we produce membranes used in blood filtration applications for hemodialysis  blood oxygenation and plasmapheresis 
growth in demand for hemodialysis membranes is driven by the increasing worldwide population of end stage renal disease patients 
we believe that conversion to single use dialyzers and increasing treatment frequency will result in additional dialyzer market growth 
in the third quarter of  we completed the expansion of our purema hemodialysis membrane production capacity 
for filtration and specialty applications  we produce a wide range of membranes and membrane based elements for micro  ultra and nanofiltration and gasification degasification of liquids 
micro  ultra and nanofiltration membrane element market growth is being driven by several factors  including end market growth in applications such as water treatment and pharmaceutical processing  displacement of conventional filtration media by membrane filtration due to membranes superior cost and performance attributes and increasing purity requirements in industrial and other applications 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on past experience and management s judgment 
because of uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are primarily composed of amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we charge accounts receivables off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when we deem them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to judgment and estimated by management 
if circumstances or economic conditions deteriorate  we may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of intangibles and goodwill identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process performed at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
step one compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the income approach  corroborated by comparison to market capitalization and key multiples of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one 
in this step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  strategic plans and future market conditions  among others 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved or changes in strategy or market conditions occur  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 

table of contents in  our annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts by substantially more than 
pension and other postretirement benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement and differences between actual results and these two actuarial assumptions can materially affect our projected benefit obligation or the valuation of our plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  expected increases in compensation  mortality and turnover 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate assumptions are based on the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
at december   a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations and the unfunded status of our pension plans by million 
the expected rates of return on our pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
for  if the expected rate of return on pension plan assets were reduced by  the result would have increased our net periodic benefit expense for fiscal by million 
at december   if the actual plan assets were reduced by  the unfunded status of our pension plans would increase by million 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana gmbh membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
at december   the environmental reserve for the membrana facility  which is denominated in euros  was million 
we anticipate that the majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis ag acordis and akzo nobel ag akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis s successors 
akzo s indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements after expenditures are made against approved claims 
at december   amounts receivable under the indemnification agreements were million 

table of contents repairs and maintenance repairs and maintenance costs  which include indirect labor and employee benefits associated with maintenance personnel and utility  maintenance and repair costs for equipment and facilities utilized in the manufacturing process  are treated as inventoriable costs 
repairs and maintenance costs as a percent of cost of goods sold have been consistent for fiscal  and major planned maintenance activities outside of the normal production process are capitalized as property  plant and equipment if the costs are expected to provide future benefits by increasing the service potential of the asset to which the repair or maintenance applies 
we have not had any major planned maintenance activities or capitalized significant repairs and maintenance costs as property  plant and equipment in the last three fiscal years

as described more fully in the discussion of segment operating results  net sales in the first quarter of will be negatively impacted by the following electronics and edvs weakness in consumer electronics and the production schedule of two edv models  transportation and industrial delay in lead acid replacement battery sales due to mild weather conditions in north america and europe  and separations media order timing in healthcare 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily due to higher production volumes and production efficiencies in the electronics and edvs segment  which has the highest gross profit margin of our segments  and the transportation and industrial segment

interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal  due to the repayment and refinancing of our senior notes in late and capitalized interest associated with capacity expansion projects in income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income for fiscal were  compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances and the relative size of our consolidated income loss before income taxes 
the mix of earnings between the tax jurisdictions has a significant impact on the effective tax rate 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates  and income earned by our subsidiaries is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions 
currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax expense in each jurisdiction relative to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate

net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal net sales increased by million due to higher volumes  offset by million of customer mix  product mix and lower sales prices 
the increase in sales volume was driven primarily by growing demand for edv applications  continued growth in consumer electronics and the benefit of new capacity from the first phase of our charlotte  north carolina expansion 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced some weakness in consumer electronics demand which we expect to continue into the first quarter of in addition  the first quarter of will be impacted by lower sales for edv applications due to the production schedules of two specific edv models 
as a result of these short term issues  first quarter lithium sales could be similar to the same period in the prior year  which would represent a decline of approximately million from the fourth quarter of however  we expect fiscal sales for electronics and edvs to be in excess of fiscal pricing for lithium battery separators is volume based  with higher volume customers receiving lower sales prices 
the decline in sales relating to mix and price was due to the increase in sales to larger volume customers 
during  sales to edv customers increased from approximately in the prior year to of total lithium separator sales  a trend that is expected to continue as demand for edvs grows and our edv targeted capacity expansions continue to come online

we believe that the short term impact in the second half of on sales in china from the government mandate requiring lead acid battery producers to demonstrate the proper handling of lead has improved 
during the fourth quarter of  we started to see the impact of mild winter weather in north america and europe  which will temporarily impact replacement battery sales in the first quarter of if it continues

net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal  including the positive effect of foreign currency translation of million 
healthcare sales increased by due to growth in hemodialysis and blood oxygenation applications and foreign currency translation 
we expect hemodialysis sales in the first quarter of to be lower than the same period in the prior year due to two customers shifting production from the first quarter to the remainder of the year  primarily the third and fourth quarters of because purchase volumes to these two customers are contractually defined  the shift in timing should not impact total fiscal sales

foreign operations as of december   we manufacture our products at strategically located facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from the foreign locations were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
typically  we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produces the product is located 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
seasonality operations at our european production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations 
as a result  operating income during the third quarter of any fiscal year may be lower than operating income in other quarters during the same fiscal year 
because of the seasonal fluctuations  comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by million since january   as cash generated from operations was used to fund growth investments 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  consisting of cash generated from operations of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory associated with our sales growth 
accounts receivable days sales outstanding is consistent with the prior year  and we have not experienced significant changes in accounts receivable aging or customer payment terms and believe that we have adequately provided for potential bad debts 
inventory is generally not subject to obsolescence and does not have a shelf life  and we do not believe there is a significant risk of inventory impairment 
investing activities 
in fiscal  total capital expenditures were million  net of doe grant awards of million  compared to million for fiscal capital expenditures in were primarily related to capacity expansions across all of our businesses  especially for lithium battery separators targeted for edv applications 
the capacity expansion projects will continue in and based on currently approved projects  total capital spending for fiscal is expected to be similar to fiscal and will be funded by cash from operations 
as of december   we had million of construction in progress which was primarily related to the capacity expansion projects 
financing activities 
during fiscal  financing activities consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments under our credit agreement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we intend to fund our ongoing operations with cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement 
as of december  and january   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries 
there were no significant restrictions on our ability to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries  or any material adverse tax consequences that would impact our ability to transfer funds held by foreign subsidiaries to the us our senior secured credit agreement provides for a us dollar term loan facility million outstanding at december   a euro term loan facility million outstanding at december  and a million revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings or undrawn standby letters of credit outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july interest rates under the senior secured credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate or the eurocurrency base rate plus a specified margin 
at december   interest rates on the us dollar term loan and euro term loan were and  respectively 
when loans are outstanding under the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a senior leverage ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda of less than to 
at december   our senior leverage ratio was to and therefore  had no effect on borrowings available

adjusted ebitda  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal net income add subtract depreciation and amortization expense interest expense  net income taxes stock based compensation foreign currency gain loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment costs related to the ftc litigation other non cash or non recurring charges adjusted ebitda as of december   the calculation of the senior leverage ratio  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal indebtedness adjusted ebitda actual leverage ratio x calculated as the sum of outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement  less cash on hand not to exceed million 
the senior secured credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit capital spending  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the agreement also contains certain customary events of default  subject to grace periods  as appropriate 
we believe that limitations imposed by the senior secured credit agreement will not significantly inhibit us from meeting our ongoing capital expenditure needs 
the senior notes mature on november  and are guaranteed by most of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
except under certain circumstances  the senior notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november the senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default  including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments 
future debt service payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and future refinancing of our debt 
our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be million 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements over both the short next twelve months and long term in relation to our debt service requirements 
in evaluating the sufficiency of our liquidity  we considered cash on hand  expected cash flow to be generated from operations and available borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement compared to our anticipated cash requirements for debt service  working capital  cash taxes  capital expenditures and funding requirements for long term liabilities 
we anticipate that our cash on hand and operating cash 
table of contents flow  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control

from time to time  we may explore additional financing methods and other means to lower our cost of capital  which could include equity or debt financings and the application of the proceeds therefrom to the repayment of bank debt or other indebtedness 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
we do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
the environmental reserve for the membrana facility  which is denominated in euros  was million at december  we anticipate that that majority of expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis and akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis s successors 
akzo s indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements after expenditures are made against approved claims 
at december   amounts receivable under the indemnification agreements were million 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  some of the amounts included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  anticipated actions by third parties and other actions 
because

interest rates under the term loan facilities are variable and the table assumes that these rates are the same rates that were in effect at december  for the euro denominated debt  the table assumes that the dollar euro exchange rate is the rate at december  for all periods presented 
we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease agreement 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options 
for euro denominated leases  the table assumes that the dollar euro exchange rate is the period average rate for and for all periods presented 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have long term liabilities for pension and postretirement benefits of million as of december  our contributions for these benefit plans are not included in the table above since the timing and amount of payments are dependent upon many factors  including when an employee retires or leaves the company  certain benefit elections by employees  return on plan assets  minimum funding requirements and foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that contributions to the pension and postretirement plans in fiscal will be million 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have recorded a liability at december  of million for unrecognized tax benefits 
payments related to this liability are not included in the table above since the timing and actual amounts of the payments  if any  are not known 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have a net environmental receivable of million  consisting of an environmental obligation of million offset by the related indemnification receivable of million 
indemnification payments are received after expenditures are made against approved claims 
as a result  we expect to make environmental obligation payments over the next twelve months and receive indemnification payments over the next two years 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at december   we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt  we may utilize interest rate derivatives 
as of december   there were no outstanding interest rate derivatives 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would be million per year 
currency risk outside of the united states  we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
as a result  exposure to foreign currency fluctuations exists 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
our subsidiaries and affiliates also purchase and sell products and services in various currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to cost increases relative to the local currencies in the markets in which we sell 
because the percentage of our sales in foreign currencies differs from the percentage of our costs in foreign currencies  a change in the relative value of the us dollar could have a disproportionate impact on our sales compared to our costs  which could impact our margins 
a portion of our assets are based in our foreign locations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency  primarily the euro 
the dollar euro exchange rates used in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended as set forth below were as follows period end rate period average rate our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  involve foreign currency derivatives 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency derivatives outstanding
