item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pt s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
pt s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond pt s control 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other factors  business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  inability to gauge order flows from customers  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  errors or defects in our products  the effects of pending or threatened litigation  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to investments  foreign regulations  possible loss or significant curtailment of significant government contracts or subcontracts and potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  during weak or uncertain economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of their orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of pt s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
management s judgment in making these estimates and relying on these assumptions may materially impact amounts reported for any period 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition software development costs valuation of inventories income taxes product warranty stock based compensation restructuring costs carrying value of long lived assets revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfied 
in september  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
as a result  these arrangements are accounted for in accordance with new  non software guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the fasb also amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new authoritative guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
it also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  and best estimated selling price besp if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 
the new guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements which we used historically when we applied the software revenue recognition guidance to our multiple element arrangements 
we have adopted this guidance as of january  as most of our signaling products include both tangible products and software elements that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality  the existing software revenue recognition guidance no longer applies to these transactions 
the adoption of the new  non software revenue recognition guidance did not have a material impact on the timing  pattern  or amount of revenue recognized in based on currently available information  we anticipate that the impact of adopting this guidance on revenue recognition in future periods will not be material 
however  this assessment may change because such impacts depend on terms and conditions of arrangements in effect in those future periods 
the new guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
for our multiple deliverable arrangements  our products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
our multiple deliverable arrangements generally include a combination of our telecommunications hardware and software products  services including installation and training  and support services 
these arrangements typically have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation  termination  or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue 
for substantially all of our multiple deliverable arrangements  whereby equipment and software are combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  we defer support and services revenue  and recognize revenue for delivered products in an arrangement when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery of the last product has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is deemed probable 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is based on customer specific criteria  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the receipt of customer acceptance or the expiration of acceptance period 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
services revenue is typically recognized upon completion of the services for fixed fee service arrangements  as these services are relatively short term in nature typically several weeks  or in limited cases  several months 
for service arrangements that are billed on a time and material basis  we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into prior to january  and not materially modified after that date  we recognize revenue based on the existing software revenue recognition guidance  which require the entire fee from the arrangement to be allocated to each respective element based on its relative selling price using vsoe 
for such arrangements  when we are unable to establish vsoe for the delivered telecommunications products  we utilize the residual method to allocate revenue to each of the elements of an arrangement 
under this method  we allocate the total fee in an arrangement first to the undelivered elements typically support and services based on vsoe of those elements  and the remaining  or residual portion of the fee to the delivered elements typically the product or products 
for multiple deliverable arrangements entered into after january   we recognize revenue based on the new non software revenue recognition guidance 
we allocate consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we follow a hierarchy to allocate the selling price of vsoe  then tpe and finally besp 
because we rarely sell products with multiple deliverable arrangements on a stand alone basis or without support  we are not able to establish vsoe for these products 
additionally  we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of our products and the markets in which we compete 
accordingly  we expect the selling price of our proprietary hardware and software products to be based on our besp 
we have established vsoe for our support and services and  therefore  we utilize vsoe for these elements 
since the adoption of the new guidance  we have primarily used the same information used to set pricing strategy to determine besp 
the company has corroborated the besp with our historical sales prices  the anticipated margin on the deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar deliverables and the characteristics of the geographical markets in which the deliverables are sold 
we plan to analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of arrangement consideration at least semi annually 
selling prices will be analyzed more frequently if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are charged to expense as research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  using the straight line method or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the accounting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product life cycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product life cycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  including purchasing  sales  production  and after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product life cycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes pt provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made 
pt operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of pt 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
in addition  the calculation of pt s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
pt recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires pt to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires pt to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
pt re evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
at december   there are no tax uncertainties that pt has determined are required to be recognized 
finally  the value of pt s deferred tax assets is dependent upon pt s ability to generate future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which pt operates 
these assets consist of research credit carry forwards  capital and net operating loss carry forwards  and the future tax effect of temporary differences between balances recorded for financial statement purposes and for tax return purposes 
it will require future pre tax earnings in excess of million in order to fully realize the value of the company s deferred tax assets 
due to the uncertainty of pt s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been recorded against substantially the full value of its deferred tax assets 
product warranty warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of pt s products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
stock based compensation pt s board of directors approves grants of stock options to employees to purchase our common stock 
stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 
restructuring costs restructuring costs generally consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified  or if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimates depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
carrying value of long lived assets pt periodically reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  other than capitalized software development costs and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
pt assesses the recoverability of the carrying values of long lived assets by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
pt estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  pt records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
pt determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of long lived assets is considered a critical accounting estimate because pt s impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including revenue growth rates  expense levels  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact estimated future cash flows and the estimated fair value of long lived assets 
overview performance technologies  incorporated pt  a delaware corporation founded in  is a global supplier of advanced network communications solutions to service providers  government and oem markets 
pt s product portfolio includes ip centric network elements and applications designed for high availability  scalability  and long life cycle deployments 
the industry leading monterey microtca and ipnexus platforms anchor a growing portfolio of pt solutions 
oems and application developers  including pt itself  leverage the robust carrier grade linux development environment and rich suite of communications protocols pt s nexusware of our application ready platforms as a cornerstone component of their end product value proposition 
pt s segway signaling solutions provide affordable  high density signaling  advanced routing for lte and ims applications  ip migration  gateway capabilities  sip bridging  and core to edge distributed intelligence  as well as features such as number portability and sms spam defense 
the company s xpress ngn applications enable evolving mobile  multi media  and ims based revenue generating services 
pt s business addresses one industry segment communications  and globally targets two primary vertical markets for its network communications products telecommunications  and military  aerospace and government systems 
the telecommunications market  historically our largest vertical market  is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our application ready platforms  which are sold to oems  depend primarily on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
telecommunications market revenues generated from service providers purchasing our segway and xpress product lines result from investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands such as text messaging and the transition to internet based communications networks 
sales into the military  aerospace and government systems market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
military  aerospace and government systems budgets are currently under pressure and shipments are subject to project deployment schedules  which are often unpredictable 
during  the economy recovered unevenly around the world and business conditions continued to remain very challenging in the telecommunications equipment market 
the new norm in our oem business appears to be that oem customers place orders for product only when they have orders in hand from their customers and then expect almost immediate delivery 
revenues from our telecommunications customers grew by million  or in  compared to the opportunity for government funded network infrastructure and military related expenditures remains positive but the timing of awarded business for the most part is highly unpredictable 
revenues from the military  aerospace and government systems market customers grew by million  or in  compared to our xpress product line is generating interest from both telecommunications and government customers 
pt began a pilot program with a government customer during the third quarter to demonstrate the xpress products capabilities in a communications cost reduction program 
the first contract award for this program is expected during forward looking visibility on customer orders is very challenging 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  markets and economic environment 
strategy the company s strategy is to maximize the value proposition of its products by leveraging its field proven systems  software and hardware technologies 
management believes the tightly integrated combination of these technologies results in considerable benefits to its customers including a compelling return on investment proposition  significant development risk mitigation and a substantially accelerated time to market opportunity 
management is focused on building on the momentum generated in and will continue to concentrate on the four network communications focused initiatives established in to construct a solid foundation for long term growth 
these initiatives include further strengthening our segway signaling systems product line  continued evolution and enhancement of our open standards based application ready platforms for mission critical communications applications  intensifying our market diversification efforts in government systems markets  and identifying forward looking network communications growth opportunities  such as our xpress portfolio of sip based applications and enabling infrastructure  that we can pursue with our own end product solutions 
in addition  our signaling product portfolio  which is targeted at the service provider market  has reached a scale in terms of features  functionality and cost effectiveness that generates strong interest on a global basis and especially in many emerging markets 
as a result  beginning in  the sales and marketing strategy for our signaling products became more focused on working with strong channel partners as our primary vehicle to further expand our reach in the global and emerging markets 
to that end  we added genband as a strong channel partner in january  kapsch carriercom ag in the third quarter  and we continue to work closely under our established relationship with alcatel lucent as another major channel partner 
from an expense perspective  in the fourth quarter  management proactively undertook several new investments to further position pt for growth as business conditions improve 
the timing of these investments was based upon forward looking market data that we expected would drive opportunities for our technologies 
it became apparent during the second half of that the economic and industry trends that occurred did not drive growth for pt s products to the degree expected 
therefore  in december  pt announced an expense reduction program to substantially reduce its operating expenses by consolidating our san luis obispo  california engineering operation with our rochester  new york engineering group and also reducing of our sales and marketing staff 
management believes that while it was necessary to make these reductions for financial reasons  the significant strategic investments made during were important in underpinning a solid foundation for long term future growth 
there are identifiable risks associated with pt s strategy in the current economic climate 
while management believes that its network communications market focus offers opportunities for growth in the long term  network infrastructure investments by carriers are very sluggish  the market for signaling products is declining and the market for sip based products is not growing rapidly enough to offset these declines 
despite the current economic conditions  which may involve new risks not currently identified  management believes the outlook for the company s profitability is improving 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicator pt believes that a key indicator for its business is the trend for the volume of orders received from customers 
the telecommunications market  historically our largest vertical market  is fundamentally driven by investments in network infrastructure by carriers and service providers 
telecommunications market revenues derived from our monterey and ipnexus application ready platforms depend primarily on broad  multi year deployments of next generation telecommunications infrastructure 
telecommunications market revenues generated from service providers result from investments necessary to support existing and evolving service demands such as text messaging and the transition to internet based communications networks 
revenues from our telecommunications customers grew by million  or in  compared to the economy appears to be recovering unevenly around the world and current business conditions continue to remain quite challenging in the telecommunications equipment market 
sales into the military  aerospace and government systems market are typically to prime contractors and system integrators that reflect investment levels by various government agencies and military branches in specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
revenues from the military  aerospace and government systems market customers grew by million  or in  compared to during  the challenging economic climate continued to cause customers to limit and or delay investments in their network infrastructure 
however  pt is gaining market traction despite this climate 
sales to customers amounted to million in  compared to million in during weak economic periods  customers ability to forecast their requirements deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
forward looking visibility on customer orders continues to be very challenging 
financial overview revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in despite continued weakness in the global economy  pt experienced a increase in demand for its products from its telecommunications customers as service providers appear to be moderately increasing capital expenditure budgets 
for the year  pt experienced revenue growth from its new distribution relationships which totaled million 
also contributing to telecommunications revenue were increases in shipments to three customers amounting to 
million  
million and million  respectively 
shipments to pt s largest customer increased million in over  to million 
shipments to customers outside of the united states represented and of sales in and  respectively 
shipments to customers in the united states increased by million in as compared to  representing substantially all of the revenue increase for the year 
shipments to the united kingdom represented and of pt s total sales in and  respectively 
the increase in shipments to various military  aerospace and government customers amounted to million  representing a increase  compared to earnings pt incurred a net loss in amounting to million  or 
per basic share  based on million shares outstanding 
this loss included restructuring charges of 
per share  stock based compensation expense of 
per share  an impairment charge against fixed assets of

pt incurred a net loss in amounting to million  or per basic share  based on million shares outstanding 
this loss included restructuring charges of 
per share  write offs of software development costs of 
per share  stock based compensation expense of 
per share litigation expenses of 
per share  and discrete income tax provision items totaling 
per share 
cash cash  cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and the company had no long term debt at either date 
the decrease in cash in was due primarily to million of cash used for the purchase of equipment  inventory and intellectual property  including signaling software products from genband in january  and the payment of accrued restructuring costs  partially offset by positive cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities amounted to million in  as compared with cash used by operating activities of million in the change in operating cash flows totaled million year over year 
the amount included net loss of million  offset by non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  asset write offs and impairments totaling million and stock based compensation expense of 
million 
in addition  inventories decreased by million  offset substantially by a million decrease in accounts payable and a 
million increase in accounts receivable 
accrued expenses declined by million primarily due to the payment of accrued restructuring costs and a 
million decrease in accrued vacation 
the increase in accounts receivable was principally due to higher fourth quarter sales in  compared to the decrease in inventory is primarily attributable to the higher sales level in and the working down of the inventory that was needed to accommodate the transition to a contract manufacturer in accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower levels of inventory purchases at the end of  as compared with the prior year end 
restructuring activities pt completed two restructuring actions during in december  pt announced its decision to outsource the manufacturing of the printed circuit board assembly for pt s hardware products 
in connection with this decision  the company reduced its rochester workforce by fourteen employees during and in december  the company announced its plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the continuing challenges of the global economic environment 
this program  which was completed in the fourth quarter  was projected to reduce operating expenses by approximately million to million on an annualized run rate basis 
it included closing the san luis obispo  california engineering facility and the elimination of sales  marketing and engineering positions which represented approximately of the company s workforce 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of and a pre tax charge of 
million in for severance and other costs related to this program 
this program required an outlay of cash totaling in pt implemented two restructuring actions during in january  the company implemented a strategic reduction of its existing workforce in response to the challenging global economic environment 
as a result of this action  the company eliminated twenty positions in the first quarter  approximately of its global workforce 
in the first quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
in july  the company implemented a voluntary separation program in which substantially all us employees were offered the opportunity to elect termination of employment  subject to the company s approval 
eight employees voluntarily terminated under this program 
in the third quarter  pt recorded restructuring charges for cash expenditures associated with employee related costs of approximately 
million 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales  which has been included as an aid to understanding pt s results and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
year ended december  sales cost of goods sold software capitalization write off gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charges 
impairment charges vendor software impairment charges of goodwill and long lived assets total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss year ended december  compared with the year ended december  sales 
total revenue for amounted to million  compared to million for pt s products have been grouped into two primary vertical markets within one segment  communications 
revenue from each product category is expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated telecommunications military  aerospace and government systems total telecommunications products telecommunications products are comprised of monterey and ipnexus application ready platforms  segway signaling systems and xpress products 
pt s application ready platforms are designed for high availability  scalability  and long life cycle deployments and are sold to telecommunication equipment manufacturers 
the company s segway signaling products  which are built on our application ready platforms  provide a full suite of signaling solutions that seamlessly bridge between circuit switched networks and growing ip based networks 
pt s xpress products are a portfolio of sip based applications and enabling infrastructure for next generation network ngn architectures 
revenue from telecommunications products amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in revenue of million  or  primarily reflects the impact of pt s significant new channel partner relationships which totaled million in  plus a million increase in sales to a customer in africa 
sales to the company s largest customer increased 
million  from million to million 
military  aerospace and government products our government systems group continues to work with numerous prime contractors to incorporate pt s cots based  application ready systems into specific programs and projects requiring enhanced communications capabilities 
revenue from military  aerospace and government system products was million and million in and  respectively 
this increase of million  or  included increased shipments to two customers amounting to million and 
million  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  and expenses associated with engineering contracts and the technical support function 
gross profit totaled million and million in and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
gross margin was and of sales for and  respectively 
of the increase in margin  
million resulted from a decrease in charges to write off or write down to estimated net realizable value software development costs 
such charges totaled 
million and 
million in and  respectively 
the most significant factors impacting the improved gross margin were the increase in revenue  an improvement in product mix toward higher margin  more software content products  especially our signaling products  and better utilization of the company s fixed manufacturing labor and overhead due to the increase in sales 
included in cost of goods sold is the amortization of software development costs and purchased intangible assets  which totaled million and million in and  respectively  excluding the charges for the write down of capitalized software development projects discussed above 
the amount of amortization recorded in increased by 
million  as compared to  due to the amortization associated with the purchase of signaling technology from genband in january this technology is being amortized over a five year estimated life 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including restructuring expenses of 
million  and stock compensation expense of 
million 
total operating expenses in amounted to million including restructuring charges of million and stock compensation expense of 
million 
total operating expenses decreased million from to  as discussed below 
selling and marketing expenses amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease of million  or  was principally the result of reduced numbers of sales and marketing personnel primarily due to the company s december restructuring program  lower trade show spending  and lower expenses due to an improved foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound  offset partially by higher commissions 
research and development expenses amounted to million and million in and the company capitalizes certain software development costs  which reduces the amount charged to research and development expenses 
amounts capitalized were million and million in and  respectively 
gross research and development expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in gross research and development expenditures totaled million  or  and was primarily due to the company s decision to close its engineering center in san luis obispo  california  reducing engineering by seventeen positions 
general and administrative expenses totaled million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses in and early in were unusually high due to the costs associated with the company s defense of intellectual property litigation instituted by one of the company s competitors 
this litigation was dismissed in may litigation related expenses declined by 
million from to during  pt recorded a 
million charge to impair certain assets in conjunction with the company s termination of a value added resellers agreement 

million of the decrease in total operating expenses from to was due to a change in the company s paid time off policy 
in addition  a 
million out of period charge was recorded in to reduce the recorded balance of software development costs 
restructuring charges amounted to 
million and million in and  respectively 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges related to two programs 
in december  the company announced its decision to outsource its printed circuit board assembly operation to a contract manufacturer 
this action resulted in the elimination of fourteen positions during  for which a restructuring charge of 
million was recorded 
in december  the company announced a reduction in force  which was completed during the fourth quarter of a restructuring charge of 
million and 
million was recorded in and  respectively  in connection with this action 
restructuring charges amounted to 
million in and relate to two reductions in force that management initiated during the year 
in january  twenty positions were eliminated in an involuntary reduction in force  while in august  eight positions were eliminated in a voluntary reduction in force 
both of these actions were completed in a summary of the activity with respect to the and restructuring activity is as follows amounts in millions number lease of severance commitments employees reserve and other total balance at january  restructuring charges

other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income and totaled 
million in  compared to 
million in this decrease was due to continued depressed yields the company is earning on its investments and lower average cash and investment balances in than in as of december   the company s funds are primarily invested in high quality corporate bonds of short duration  government backed money market funds  municipal bonds and bank guaranteed interest contracts 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate is a combination of federal  state and foreign tax rates and is generally lower than statutory rates because it includes benefits derived from tax credits related to research and development activities in the united states and canada  and tax exempt interest income 
for  the income tax benefit amounted to 
million and includes the effect of expected foreign investment and research credits 
for  the income tax provision amounted to
