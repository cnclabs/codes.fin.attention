risk factors our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  and as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the expansion of our business through the construction of new paper making and converting facilities may not proceed as anticipated 
in connection with our long term growth strategy  we are building a new tad paper machine and converting facilities in shelby  north carolina 
building these facilities entails numerous risks  including difficulties in completing the project on time due to construction issues  permitting issues or as a result of the litigation described in the following paragraph  cost overruns and difficulties in integrating the new operations and personnel 
any of these risks  if realized  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  such events could also divert management s attention from other business concerns 
the tad paper machine under construction in north carolina is highly complex and costly and it can be manufactured by only a few companies in the world 
in  we contracted with metso paper usa to construct the tad paper machine 
our contract with metso paper calls for an expected delivery of the tad paper machine by july in august  first quality tissue se  llc  a competing third party tissue manufacturer  filed a lawsuit against metso paper  which is now pending in federal court in south carolina  to enjoin metso paper from delivering a tad paper machine to clearwater paper based on the terms of an agreement between metso paper and first quality 
although we were not named as a party to this litigation  we intervened in the litigation in november to represent our interests 
in light of this ongoing litigation  there is no assurance that metso paper will be able to deliver the tad paper machine that we contracted for on time 
in such case  we do not expect that we would be able to find a replacement without significant additional cost and delay 
we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of cellu tissue because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
in december  we acquired cellu tissue  which significantly expanded the size of our manufacturing and converting operations 
the long term success of the acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition  including anticipated cost savings from synergies  which 
table of contents we have estimated to be between and million in and on track to be between and million in the aggregate on an annual basis in future years 
the ongoing integration process has been and will continue to be complex and time consuming 
the potential risks associated with our efforts to integrate the operations of cellu tissue s business include  among others failure to implement effectively our business plan for the combined business  unanticipated issues in the continuing integration of financial  manufacturing  logistics  information  communications and other systems  failure to retain key employees  failure to retain key customers  and unanticipated issues  expenses and liabilities 
failure to achieve  or a delay in achieving  these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues  diversion of management s time and energy  and could materially impact our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
changes in the cost and availability of wood fiber used in production of our products may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
wood fiber is the principal raw material used to create wood pulp  which in turn is used to manufacture our pulp and paperboard products and consumer products 
in  our wood fiber costs were of our cost of sales 
much of the wood fiber we use in our pulp manufacturing process is the by product of sawmill operations 
as a result  the price of these residual wood fibers is affected by operating levels in the lumber industry 
the significant reduction in home building over the past four years resulted in the closure or curtailment of operations at many sawmills 
the price of wood fiber is expected to remain volatile until the housing market recovers and sawmill operations increase 
additionally  the supply and price of wood fiber can be negatively affected by weather and other events 
the effects on market prices for wood fiber resulting from various governmental programs involving tax credits or payments related to biomass and other renewable energy projects are uncertain and could result in a reduction in the supply of wood fiber available for our pulp and paperboard manufacturing operations 
if we and our pulp suppliers are unable to obtain wood fiber at favorable prices or at all  our financial results  operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
we have increased our dependence on external sources of wood pulp  which subjects our business and results of operations to significant price fluctuations 
in  our consumer products segment sourced approximately of its annual pulp supply from our pulp and paperboard segment  while the cellu tissue operations we acquired historically relied entirely on external suppliers for wood pulp 
consequently  due to the integration of the cellu tissue operations  our consumer products segment sourced approximately of its pulp requirements externally during the increased dependence on external sources of wood pulp increases our exposure to fluctuations in prices for wood pulp  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results  operations and cash flows 
the volatility of pulp prices can adversely affect our earnings if we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or if the timing of any price increases for our products significantly trails the increases in pulp prices 
we have not hedged these risks 
increases in our transportation costs or disruptions in our transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business  particularly our consumer products business  is dependent on transportation services to deliver our products to our customers and to deliver raw materials to us 
in  our transportation costs were of our cost of sales 
the costs of these transportation services are primarily determined by fuel 
table of contents prices  which have steadily increased since and are affected by geopolitical and economic events 
we have not been in the past  and may not be in the future  able to pass along part or all of any fuel price increases to customers 
if we are unable to increase our prices as a result of increased fuel costs charged to us by transportation providers  our gross margins may be materially adversely affected 
if any transportation providers fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture products on a timely basis 
shipments of products and raw materials may be delayed due to weather conditions  labor strikes or other events 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or products in a timely manner could harm our reputation  negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the cost of chemicals and energy needed for our manufacturing processes significantly affects our business 
we use a variety of chemicals in our manufacturing processes  including latex and polyethylene  many of which are petroleum based chemicals 
in  our chemical costs were of our cost of sales 
prices for these chemicals have been and are expected to remain volatile 
in addition  chemical suppliers that use petroleum based products in the manufacture of their chemicals may  due to supply shortages and cost increases  ration the amount of chemicals available to us  and therefore we may not be able to obtain at favorable prices the chemicals we need to operate our business  if we are able to obtain them at all 
our manufacturing operations utilize large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
in  our energy costs were of our cost of sales 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade  which in turn affects cost of sales 
we purchase on the open market a substantial portion of the natural gas necessary to produce our products  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand  geopolitical events  government regulation  and natural disasters 
to help mitigate the exposure to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  we have occasionally used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements 
we have also taken steps to reduce our energy usage through conservation and to increase our internal energy production at our lewiston  idaho  menominee  michigan and east hartford  connecticut  cogeneration facilities 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on reducing energy usage 
any significant energy shortage or significant increase in our energy costs in circumstances where we cannot raise the price of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
any disruption in the supply of energy could also affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders from  or changes in prices in regards to  any of our large customers could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in  our consumer products segment derived approximately of its net sales  and we derived approximately of our total net sales  from three customers 
we have experienced increased price and promotion competition for our consumer products customers  which can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our financial condition 
some of our customers have the capability to produce the parent rolls or products themselves that they purchase from us 
our pulp and paperboard segment sells its products to a large number of customers  although certain customers have historically purchased a significant amount of our pulp or paperboard products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers that ensure a continuing level of business from them 
in addition  our agreements with our customers are not exclusive and generally do not contain minimum volume purchase commitments 
our relationship with our large customers will depend on our ability to continue to meet their needs for quality products at competitive prices 
if we lose one of these customers or if we experience a significant decline in the level of purchases by any of them  we may not be able to quickly replace the lost business 
table of contents volume and our operating results and business could be harmed 
in addition  our focus on these large accounts could affect our ability to serve our smaller accounts  particularly when product supply is tight and we are not able to fully satisfy orders for these smaller accounts 
changes in demand for certain products could adversely affect our financial results 
our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to adjust to increases and decreases in demand 
if we are unable to respond to increases in demand  we may need to limit deliveries of some orders for existing customers  which could harm our reputation and our long term relationships with these customers 
alternatively  if we experience a decrease in demand for certain products  we may incur significant costs in revising our manufacturing plan 
if we are not able to respond to changes in demand for our products in a timely manner  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
branded products and increased competition over tad products could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
our consumer products compete with well known  branded products  as well as other private label products 
inherent risks in our competitive strategy include whether our products will receive direct and retail customer acceptance  new product offerings by competitors  the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels  and price competition from companies that may have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  some of our private label competitors have built or have announced plans to build new papermaking facilities that will produce tad paper used to produce high end consumer products that compete with high end branded products 
we currently produce tad paper used for paper towels at only two facilities located in las vegas and st 
catharines  ontario  and we currently do not produce tad bathroom tissue 
if we are unable to offer our existing customers  or new customers  comparable consumer products and in sufficient quantities  we may lose business or we may not be able to grow our existing business and be forced to sell lower margin products  all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
cyclical industry conditions have in the past affected and may continue to adversely affect the operating results and cash flow of our pulp and paperboard business 
our pulp and paperboard business is particularly affected by cyclical market conditions 
we may be unable to sustain pricing in the face of weaker demand  and weaker demand may in turn cause us to take production downtime 
in addition to lost revenue from lower shipment volumes  production downtime causes unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs due to lower production levels 
our results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected in a period of prolonged and significant market weakness 
we are not able to predict market conditions or our ability to sustain pricing and production levels during periods of weak demand 
we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers for certain raw materials required for the production of our products 
furthermore  in some cases we rely on a single supplier 
our dependence on a limited number of third party suppliers or on a single supplier  and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials  involve several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality  and delivery schedules 
we cannot be certain that our current suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or will continue to satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements 
any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be identified and qualified 
although we believe there are other suppliers of these raw materials  we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms 
any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could interrupt production of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
additional expansion of our business through construction of new facilities or acquisitions may not proceed as anticipated 
in addition to the acquisition of cellu tissue and construction of our north carolina facilities  in the future we may build other converting and papermaking facilities  pursue acquisitions of existing facilities  or both 

table of contents we may be unable to identify future suitable building locations or acquisition targets 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from construction projects or acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate  or at all 
any inability by us to integrate and manage any new or acquired facilities or businesses in a timely and efficient manner  any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these projects or acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
large construction projects or acquisitions can result in a decrease in our cash and short term investments  an increase in our indebtedness  or both  and also may limit our ability to access additional capital when needed and divert management s attention from other business concerns 
united states and global economic conditions could have adverse effects on the demand for our products and financial results 
us and global economic conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results 
in particular  the away from home consumer paper products market has experienced a decline because of the slowdown in the travel and restaurant industries as a result of the current economic downturn 
recessed economic conditions affect our business in a number of ways  including causing i increased pressure for price concessions from customers  ii declines in domestic and global demand for paperboard  iii shifts in customer purchases that affect the mix of our product sales  iv decreased or low housing starts  which increase production costs due to lower wood fiber supplies  and v financial distress or insolvency for certain customers which could affect our sales volumes or our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from those customers 
larger competitors have operational and other advantages over our operations 
the markets for our products are highly competitive  and companies that have substantially greater financial resources compete with us in each market 
some of our competitors will have advantages over us  including lower raw material and labor costs and better access to the inputs of our products 
our consumer products business faces competition from companies that produce the same type of products that we produce or that produce alternative products that customers may use instead of our products 
our consumer products business competes with the branded tissue products producers  such as procter gamble  and branded label producers who manufacture branded and private label products  such as georgia pacific and kimberly clark 
these companies are far larger than us  have much greater sales  marketing and research and development resources than we do  and enjoy significant cost advantages due to economies of scale 
in addition  because of their size and resources  these companies may foresee market trends more accurately than we do and develop new technologies that render our products less attractive or obsolete 
our ability to successfully compete in the pulp and paperboard industry is influenced by a number of factors  including manufacturing capacity  general economic conditions and the availability and demand for paperboard substitutes 
our pulp and paperboard business competes with international paper  meadwestvaco  georgia pacific  rocktenn and international producers  most of whom are much larger than us 
any increase in manufacturing capacity by any of these or other producers could result in overcapacity in the pulp and paperboard industry  which could cause downward pressure on pricing 
in addition  customers could choose to use types of paperboard that we do not produce or could rely on alternative materials  such as plastic  for their products 
an increased supply of any of these products could cause us to lower our prices or lose sales to competitors  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the consolidation of paperboard converting businesses  including through the acquisition and integration of such converting business by larger competitors of ours  could result in a loss of customers and sales on the part of our pulp and paperboard business  which does not include paperboard converting facilities or capabilities 
a loss of paperboard customers or sales as a result of consolidations and integrations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our qualification to retain  or ability to utilize  tax credits associated with alternative fuels or cellulosic biofuels and the tax treatment associated with receipt of such credits are uncertain 
in  we received refundable federal tax credit payments in connection with our use of black liquor  a by product of the pulp manufacturing process  in an alternative fuel mixture to produce energy at our pulp mills 
the amount of the refundable tax credit was equal to per gallon of alternative fuel mixture used 
this tax credit expired on december  in  we recorded pre tax income of million related to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc 
we did not record any income in relating to the afmtc 
there is relatively little guidance regarding the afmtc and the law governing the issue is complex 
accordingly  there remains uncertainty as to our qualification to receive the tax credit in  as well as to whether we will be entitled to retain the amounts we received upon further review by the internal revenue service  or irs 
in addition  while it is our position that payments received or credits taken in relation to the afmtc should not be subject to corporate income tax  there can be no assurance as to whether or not the amounts we have received will be subject to taxation 
we are also registered with the irs as a cellulosic biofuel producer  which enables us to claim the per gallon cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  in regards to black liquor produced and used as a fuel by us at our pulp mills in we have changed  and may in the future make additional changes in  our position as to some or all of the credits we claimed under the afmtc on our federal income tax form  provided we believe we will have sufficient future federal taxable earnings to enable us to carry forward the credits potentially available under the cbpc 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize the cbpc 
congress has identified the elimination or modification of the cbpc in connection with black liquor as a possible revenue source 
such legislative action could limit or eliminate our ability to convert afmtc gallons to cbpc gallons and or cbpc gallons to afmtc gallons and  accordingly  limit or eliminate our ability to claim carry forward credits of million 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
approximately of our full time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements 
as these agreements expire  we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacement agreements on terms acceptable to us 
we currently have three collective bargaining agreements under negotiation 
any failure to reach an agreement with one of the unions may result in strikes  lockouts or other labor actions 
any such labor actions  including work slowdowns or stoppages  could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures  which could increase our costs and subject us to liabilities 
we are subject to various federal  state and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  water discharges  air emissions  hazardous material and waste management and environmental cleanup 
environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve and we may become subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
increased regulatory activity at the state  federal and international level is possible regarding climate change as well as other emerging environmental issues associated with our manufacturing sites 
compliance with regulations that implement new public policy in these areas might require significant expenditures on our part 
we are required to comply with environmental laws and the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to several performance based rules associated with effluent and air emissions as a result of certain of its manufacturing processes 
federal  state and local laws and regulations require us to routinely obtain authorizations from and comply with the evolving standards of the appropriate governmental authorities  which have considerable discretion over the terms of permits 
failure to comply with environmental laws and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing our operations or requiring us to take corrective measures  install pollution control equipment  or take other remedial actions  such as product recalls or labeling changes 
we also may be required to make additional expenditures  which could be significant  relating to environmental matters on an ongoing basis 

table of contents we own properties  conduct or have conducted operations at properties  and have assumed indemnity obligations in connection with our spin off in from potlatch for properties or operations  where hazardous materials have been or were used for many years  including during periods before careful management of these materials was required or generally believed to be necessary 
consequently  we will continue to be subject to risks under environmental laws that impose liability for historical releases of hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that future environmental permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew existing permits  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and any interruption in the operations of our facilities may harm our operating performance 
we regularly incur significant expenses to maintain our manufacturing equipment and facilities 
the machines and equipment that we use to produce our products are complex  have many parts and some are run on a continuous basis 
we must perform routine maintenance on our equipment and will have to periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
in addition  our pulp and paperboard facilities require periodic shutdowns to perform major maintenance 
these scheduled shutdowns of facilities result in decreased sales and increased costs in the periods in which a shutdown occurs 
unexpected production disruptions could cause us to shut down or curtail operations at any of our facilities 
for example  in we curtailed operations at our cypress bend  arkansas  pulp and paperboard facility as the result of an electrical malfunction and curtailed operations at our wiggins  mississippi  consumer products facility as the result of a fire 
disruptions could occur due to any number of circumstances  including prolonged power outages  mechanical or process failures  shortages of raw materials  natural catastrophes  disruptions in the availability of transportation  labor disputes  terrorism  changes in or non compliance with environmental or safety laws and the lack of availability of services from any of our facilities key sole suppliers 
any facility shutdowns may be followed by prolonged startup periods  regardless of the reason for the shutdown 
those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks  depending on the reason for the shutdown and other factors 
any prolonged disruption in operations at any of our facilities could cause significant lost production  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our company sponsored pension plans and one of our multiemployer pension plans are currently underfunded  and over time we will be required to make cash payments to the plans  reducing cash available for our business 
we have company sponsored pension plans covering certain of our salaried and hourly employees 
the significant decline in the securities markets beginning in and resulting substantial decline in the value of equity and fixed income investments held by these plans caused these plans to be underfunded because the projected benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets 
at december   our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded in the aggregate by approximately million 
as a result of underfunding  we are required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans 
in  we contributed million to these pension plans 
we may be required to make increased annual contributions to our pension plans in future years  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
we also contribute to two multiemployer pension plans 
the amount of our annual contributions to each of these plans is negotiated with the plan and the bargaining unit representing our employees covered by the plan 
in  we contributed million to these plans  and in future years we may be required to make increased annual contributions to these plans  which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs 
in addition  in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from any multiemployer plan that is underfunded  we would be liable for a proportionate share of such multiemployer plan s unfunded vested benefits 
based on the limited information available from the plan administrator of one of our multiemployer plans  which we cannot independently validate  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or plan termination may be material to our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any multiemployer plan that is 
table of contents underfunded  and such employer cannot satisfy its obligations under the multiemployer plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan s unfunded vested benefits 
our pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change 
in addition to our pension plans  we provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our current and former us salaried and hourly employees 
our retiree health care costs vary with changes in health care costs generally  which have significantly exceeded general economic inflation rates for many years 
our pension costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions about future investment returns 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase pension costs 
significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on information technology in critical areas of our operations  and a disruption relating to such technology could harm our financial condition 
we use information technology  or it  systems in various aspects of our operations  including enterprise resource planning  management of inventories and customer sales 
some of these systems have been in place for long periods of time 
additionally  with the acquisition of cellu tissue  we have different legacy it systems which we are continuing to integrate 
if one of these systems was to fail  or if we decide to change these systems or hire outside parties to provide these systems  we may suffer disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing new systems 
we have substantial indebtedness  which could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have outstanding indebtedness of million under notes we issued in and these substantial debt obligations could have important consequences to our business 
for example we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our substantial debt service obligations  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  including business development efforts  capital expenditures or strategic acquisitions  and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry may be limited  thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness 
our ability to make debt payments  to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our future operations 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  if we cannot service our indebtedness  we may have to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances  any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business 
we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the indentures for our notes  and our senior secured revolving credit facility  contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and our failure to comply could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of the debt to be accelerated 
the indentures governing the notes we issued in and  and our senior secured revolving credit 
table of contents facility contain various provisions that limit our discretion in the operation of our business by restricting our ability to undergo a change in control  sell assets  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  create liens  consolidate  merge  or sell substantially all of our assets  enter into certain transactions with our affiliates  engage in new lines of business  and enter into sale and lease back transactions 
these restrictions on our ability to operate our business at our discretion could seriously harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities 
in addition  our senior secured revolving credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to when there are any commitments or obligations outstanding and availability falls below or an event of default exists 
events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet this financial test 
if we are not able to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in the indentures governing our notes  our secured revolving credit facility or other debt instruments  an event of default under the relevant debt instrument could occur 
if an event of default does occur  it could trigger a cross default under our other debt instruments  prohibit us from accessing additional borrowings  and permit the holders of the defaulted debt to declare amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be immediately due and payable 
our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments 
in addition  we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt 
even if we were able to secure additional financing  it may not be available on favorable terms

on december   we acquired cellu tissue holdings  inc  or cellu tissue 
the results discussed below include cellu tissue operating results for the period december  forward 
overview highlights consumer products expansion in shelby  north carolina in  we began construction of new tissue manufacturing and converting facilities in shelby  north carolina as part of our plans to expand our consumer products segment in the eastern united states 
this site will include a through air dried  or tad  paper machine and is currently expected to have up to seven converting lines capable of producing ultra grades of private label tissue products 
the first two converting lines became operational during the second quarter of two additional converting lines are expected to become operational late in the second half of the tad paper machine is scheduled to start up in the fourth quarter of we estimate the project will cost approximately million  excluding estimated capitalized interest of million 
as of december   we have incurred a total of million in project costs  of which million was incurred in we expect substantially all remaining amounts to be spent in we have also capitalized million of interest related to the project  of which million was incurred in in august  first quality tissue se  llc  filed a lawsuit against metso paper  the company we have contracted with to supply the tad paper machine  seeking to enjoin metso paper from delivering the tad paper machine to our north carolina facilities based on the terms of an agreement between metso paper and first quality 
see item of part i of this report for a description of this legal proceeding 
integration of cellu tissue holdings  inc on december   we acquired cellu tissue  which owned nine tissue manufacturing facilities located in the southern  midwestern and eastern united states and one facility in eastern canada 
we believe the cellu tissue facilities allow us to better serve existing private label grocery customers by creating a national manufacturing footprint and provide us with the capability to expand into new private label channels 
we expect to achieve net annual cost savings from synergies of between and million in  and by the end of to be on track to achieve to million annually from cost synergies in future years 

table of contents two for one stock split and stock repurchase program on july   we announced that our board of directors had declared a two for one stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock  which was effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on august  to shareholders of record on august  also on july   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
under our stock repurchase program  we may repurchase shares in the open market or as otherwise may be determined by management  subject to market conditions  business opportunities and other factors 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of per share at a total cost of approximately million 
we have approximately million authorization remaining to repurchase shares under the program 
sale of lewiston  idaho sawmill on november   we sold our lewiston  idaho  sawmill to idaho forest group  or ifg  of coeur d alene  idaho 
the transaction included the sale of our sawmill  planer mill  dry kilns and related assets along with log and finished goods inventories and timber under contract  in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
this sawmill was our only wood products facility 
the sawmill was also a significant supplier of wood fiber to our lewiston pulp mill 
consequently  we entered into a long term residual fiber supply agreement with ifg to provide wood fiber for our lewiston pulp mill from ifg mills 
business clearwater paper corporation is a leading producer of private label tissue and bleached paperboard products 
our products are primarily pulp based and predominately manufactured in the united states 
as of december   our business was organized into two reporting segments our consumer products segment manufactures tissue products sold on a private label basis primarily to major grocery store chains  leading discount and mass merchant retailers and away from home distributors 
prior to the acquisition of cellu tissue  we operated two tissue mills with related converting facilities in idaho and nevada  and an additional converting facility located in illinois 
as a result of the cellu tissue acquisition  we now have additional manufacturing and converting facilities in connecticut  georgia  michigan  mississippi  new york  wisconsin  oklahoma  and ontario  canada 
the segment s net sales were billion in  representing approximately of our total net sales 
our pulp and paperboard segment manufactures bleached paperboard and bleached softwood pulp 
we operate two pulp and paperboard mills  one located in arkansas and one in idaho 
in  a significant portion of our pulp production was used in the manufacture of our paperboard products or transferred to our consumer products segment for use in the production of tissue products  and we expect this to be close to for the foreseeable future 
the segment s net sales were million in  representing approximately of our total net sales 
developments and trends in our business our operating results have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors  including the cyclical nature of the pulp and paperboard industry  competition  the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing operations  changes in our principal expenses such as wood fiber  chemicals  transportation  energy and maintenance  and other factors 
net sales prices for our consumer tissue products are affected by competitive conditions and the prices of branded tissue products 
tissue has historically been one of the strongest segments of the paper and forest products industry due to its steady demand growth and the absence of severe supply imbalances that occur in a number of other paper segments 
we compete based on product quality  customer service and price 
we deliver customer focused business solutions by assisting in managing product assortment  category management  and pricing and promotion optimization 

table of contents demand and pricing for our pulp and paperboard products are largely determined by macro economic conditions around the world 
paperboard prices continued to strengthen through the middle of with some weakening during the fourth quarter 
our pulp and paperboard business experiences cyclical market conditions and  as a result  historical prices for our products and sales volumes have been volatile 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand for our products 
product supply in the industries in which we operate is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
capacity in these industries tends to increase during periods when prices remain strong 
in addition  currency exchange rates affect us supplies of paperboard  as non us manufacturers are attracted to the non us market when the dollar is relatively strong 
our paperboard business  through exports denominated in us dollars  has benefited significantly from weakness in the us dollar over the past few years 
recently  however  the us dollar has been strengthening against the euro 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do compete with us in each of our markets 
in addition  our industry is capital intensive  which leads to high fixed costs  large capital outlays and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover variable costs 
these conditions have contributed to substantial price competition  particularly during periods of reduced demand 
some of our competitors have lower production costs  greater buying power and  as a result  these competitors may be less adversely affected than we are by price decreases 
net sales consist of sales of consumer tissue  pulp and paperboard and  prior to the sale of our sawmill in november  wood products  net of discounts  returns and allowances and any sales taxes collected 
sales taxes  when collected  are recorded as a current liability until remitted to the appropriate governmental entities 
operating costs year ended december  dollars in thousands cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales cost percentage of cost of sales wood fiber chemicals transportation energy maintenance and repairs excluding intersegment amounts 
excluding related labor costs 
prices for our principal operating cost items are variable and directly affect our results of operations 
for example  as economic conditions improve  we normally would expect at least some upward pressure on these operating costs 
competitive market conditions can limit our ability to pass cost increases through to our customers 
wood fiber 
our most significant operating cost is wood fiber  including pulp  logs  wood chips and sawdust  needed to supply our manufacturing facilities 
fiber prices for our pulp mills are impacted significantly by the economy as there is a direct correlation to the housing industry 
pulp prices have experienced significant fluctuations for the past months  and based on industry indices  are expected to trend upward in our consumer products segment sourced of its pulp supply from our pulp and paperboard segment in  with the remainder purchased from external suppliers 
for  total wood fiber costs were of our cost of sales  representing a percentage point increase over  and percentage points over  respectively  as a percentage of cost of sales 
the total dollar increase from to is due to 
table of contents increased volumes  partially offset by lower overall pulp prices 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the sale of our sawmill  we entered into a long term wood fiber supply agreement with ifg to provide wood fiber for our lewiston pulp mill from ifg mills 
chemicals 
we consume a significant amount of chemicals in the production of pulp and paperboard 
important chemicals we use include polyethylene  caustic  starch  sodium chlorate  latex and specialty paper process chemicals 
many of our chemicals are purchased under long term contracts  which provide more stability than open market purchases 
our chemical costs decreased as a percentage of cost of sales by one percentage point in compared to but total spend increased by million over the prior year 
we saw significant price increases for many of our chemicals in including a increase in caustic 
in addition  many of the chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  particularly in the pulp making process  are petroleum based and impacted by petroleum prices 
transportation 
fuel prices are also a large part of our cost structure and  therefore  high fuel prices result in increased transportation costs related to delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities  internal inventory transfers and delivery of our finished products to customers 
rising fuel prices particularly affect our margins for consumer products because we supply customers throughout the united states  and we transport unconverted parent rolls from our tissue mills to our tissue converting facilities 
our transportation costs decreased by percentage points in  as a percentage of cost of sales relative to  due to a lower customer transportation cost structure resulting from our ability to supply midwest and east coast consumer product customers that are located closer to the former cellu tissue facilities 
however  transportation costs increased on an aggregate basis in relative to due primarily to increased fuel costs and increased shipments 
energy 
we use energy in the form of electricity  hog fuel  steam  natural gas and  to a much lesser extent  coal 
energy prices have fluctuated widely over the past decade 
we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to volatile energy prices through conservation 
in addition  cogeneration facilities that produce steam and electricity at our east hartford  connecticut  lewiston  idaho and menominee  michigan manufacturing sites help to lower our energy costs 
to help mitigate our exposure to changes in natural gas prices  from time to time we have used firm price contracts to supply a portion of our natural gas requirements  although as of december  we had no firm price contracts in place 
our energy costs in future periods will depend principally on our ability to produce a substantial portion of our electricity needs internally  on changes in market prices for natural gas and on our ability to reduce our energy usage 
our energy costs as a percentage of cost of sales remained relatively flat in compared to maintenance and repairs 
we regularly incur significant costs to maintain our manufacturing equipment 
we perform routine maintenance on our machines and periodically replace a variety of parts such as motors  pumps  pipes and electrical parts 
major equipment maintenance and repair in our pulp and paperboard segment also requires maintenance shutdowns generally lasting up to one week per year at our idaho facility and up to one week approximately every months at our arkansas facility  which increases costs and may reduce net sales in the quarters in which the maintenance shutdowns occur 
periodically  major equipment shutdowns extend beyond one week in duration for large scale maintenance  such as extensive boiler repairs 
in  we spent million on planned major maintenance 
in march  we had machine downtime of seven days at our idaho pulp and paperboard mill due to scheduled major maintenance costing million  excluding labor 
in september  we had additional scheduled major maintenance and repair costs of million  excluding labor  at the same mill 
in we expect to spend a total of million for planned major maintenance  which consists of an estimated million at our idaho facility during the first quarter and an estimated million at our arkansas facility during the fourth quarter 
in addition to ongoing maintenance and repair costs  we make capital expenditures to increase our operating capacity and efficiency  to improve safety and to comply with environmental laws 
excluding million of expenditures for our north carolina expansion  we spent million on capital expenditures during capital expenditures for are expected to be between approximately million and million  which includes an estimated million to million associated with our north carolina expansion 

table of contents other 
other costs not mentioned in the above table primarily consist of wage and benefit expenses  operating and packaging costs  internal costs of moving inventory between locations and adjustments to cost of sales based on changes in volumes and values of inventory 
although period cut offs and inventory levels can impact other cost of sales amounts  we would expect this amount to be relatively steady as a percentage of cost of sales on a year over year basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and associated costs for sales and administrative personnel  as well as commission expenses related to sales of our products 
our total selling  general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in  with the increase primarily resulting from the costs associated with our integration of cellu tissue into our administrative functions 
interest expense interest expense is mostly comprised of interest on our million aggregate principal amount senior notes due issued in october  which we refer to as the notes  and our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due issued in june  which we refer to as the notes 
as part of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we also assumed million of industrial revenue bonds  or irbs  associated with the facility in ladysmith  wisconsin 
during the third quarter of  we redeemed the remaining principal balance of the outstanding irbs 
interest expense also includes amortization of deferred finance costs associated with the notes  notes  and revolving credit facility 
gross interest expense in increased significantly compared to as a result of interest expense incurred on the notes issued in october  as well as interest expense associated with a capital lease for the building housing our north carolina converting operations 
interest expense will be partially offset by the capitalization of interest during the construction phase of our papermaking and converting facilities  which we estimate will be approximately million in and million over the construction phase of the project 
income taxes income taxes are based on reported earnings and tax rates in jurisdictions in which our operations occur and offices are located  adjusted for available credits  changes in valuation allowances and differences in reported earnings and taxable income using current law and enacted tax rates 
our income tax provision increased million in compared to  primarily due to the million of benefits from the cellulosic biofuel producer credit  or cbpc  and related reductions in our provision for uncertain tax positions relating to the alternative fuel mixture tax credit  or afmtc  during excluding the effects of the cbpc and afmtc  the effective tax rate for was  compared to for the primary reason for the increased rate  after consideration of the cbpc and afmtc  was due to an increase from the remeasurement of state deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimated future tax rates that will be in effect when the underlying assets and liabilities are expected to be reversed 
the change in estimated state tax rates is primarily attributable to the change in our tissue business operations following the acquisition of cellu tissue in december the estimated annual effective tax rate for  excluding discrete items  is approximately results of operations our financial and other data are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
the results discussed below include cellu tissue operating results from december  forward 
at december   our business is organized into two reporting segments consumer products and pulp and paperboard 
prior to january   intersegment pulp transfers from our pulp and paperboard segment to our consumer products segment were recorded as net sales for the pulp and paperboard segment at prevailing market prices and eliminated  on a consolidated basis  to reconcile the segments total net sales to our consolidated net sales 
commencing january   rather than recording the 
table of contents intersegment transfer of pulp through net sales  the costs of pulp are transferred from the pulp and paperboard segment to the consumer products segment 
as a result  there are no eliminations required to reconcile our total consolidated net sales to the segments total net sales 
in order to facilitate comparability with the period  the operating results for the and periods have been recast to reflect the revised cost transfer methodology

cost of sales cost of sales was of net sales for  compared to for the million increase in was primarily due to higher overall costs related to the inclusion of cellu tissue s operations  as well as integration costs associated with those operations 
other factors that contributed to higher cost of sales in included wage and benefit costs associated with our north carolina expansion  higher costs for packaging supplies and chemicals  higher transportation costs due to higher fuel prices and increased shipments  and retroactive pay related to labor contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales for compared to as a result of economies of scale relating to the significantly higher sales 
the million increase in expense for compared to was primarily due to integration and startup costs related to cellu tissue and our north carolina facilities 
discussion of business segments consumer products years ended december  dollars in thousands net sales operating income percent of net sales 
table of contents the consumer products segment reported a million  or  increase in net sales and a million decrease in operating income for compared to the increase in net sales was primarily due to the addition of sales from the cellu tissue operations  which contributed to a increase in shipment volumes  partially offset by lower net selling prices 
the decrease in net selling prices is a result of the addition of cellu tissue products and the resulting change in the mix of tissue grades sold 
the cellu tissue facilities produce a broad range of products and some tissue grades that sell at lower price points than the tissue products produced by the consumer products segment historically 
the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher wage and benefit costs associated with the startup of our north carolina facilities  relocation and severance costs associated with the acquisition of cellu tissue  and retroactive pay related to labor contracts 
in addition  costs were higher for packaging supplies  transportation costs associated with higher fuel prices and additional shipments  depreciation and amortization resulting from the cellu tissue acquisition and repair and maintenance expenses associated with the cellu tissue facilities 
lower pulp costs  due to decreasing costs in the second half of  partially offset the unfavorable comparisons 
pulp and paperboard years ended december  dollars in thousands net sales operating income percent of net sales net sales for the pulp and paperboard segment were million  or  higher in compared to the increase in net sales over was largely due to an increase of in paperboard prices and slightly higher paperboard shipments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in external pulp shipments due primarily to increased internal usage 
operating income increased million in compared to the same period in the increase was largely attributable to higher net selling prices for paperboard and lower maintenance  purchased paper and wood fiber costs  all of which were partially offset by higher chemical costs

we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda i as factors in evaluating management s performance when determining incentive compensation  ii to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and iii because our credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes and notes use measures similar to ebitda to measure our compliance with certain covenants

net cash used for investing activities increased from to the increased use of cash was largely due to our acquisition of cellu tissue in  as discussed above  as well as increased cash spent on additions to plant and equipment in compared to these increased uses of cash were partially offset by converting million in short term investments into cash during cash spent on additions to plant and equipment increased million in compared to due primarily to capital spending on construction of our new tissue manufacturing and converting facilities in north carolina  which began in  as well as other capital improvement projects 
financing activities net cash used for financing activities was million for  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the use of cash in primarily consisted of million used to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and million used in the redemption of the remaining principal amount on our outstanding irbs and associated costs 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to financing related to the cellu tissue acquisition  as discussed below 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash used for financing activities of million in in we received net proceeds of million from the notes  which were used to partially fund the acquisition of cellu tissue and related expenses 
this increase in cash was offset by the retirement of million of cellu tissue notes and the repayment of million outstanding under cellu tissue s revolving line of credit at the completion of the acquisition 

table of contents capital resources due to the competitive and cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  as well as an uncertain economic environment  there is uncertainty regarding the amount of cash flows we will generate during the next twelve months 
however  we believe that our cash flows from operations as well as our cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash required to support our ongoing operations  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing capacity will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we make substantial capital expenditures or consummate an acquisition  our debt service requirements could increase 
we may choose to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all

credit arrangement on november   we entered into a million revolving credit facility with certain financial institutions 
on september   we amended our revolving credit facility  among other things  i to extend the term of the revolving loan to the earlier of september  or days prior to the maturity date of the notes  ii to increase permitted capital expenditures limits  and iii to change the interest rate margins applicable to base rate loans and libor loans in circumstances based on our fixed charge coverage ratio from time to time  and to reduce the fees paid by us on undrawn amounts 
the amount available to us under the revolving credit facility is based on the lesser of of our eligible accounts receivable plus approximately of our eligible inventory  or million 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  but approximately million of the credit facility was being used to support outstanding standby letters of credit 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus between and for libor loans  and a base rate effectively equal to the agent bank s prime rate plus between and for other loans 
the percentage margin on all loans is based on our fixed charge coverage ratio for the last twelve months  which is recalculated on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we would have been permitted to draw approximately million under the credit facility at libor plus a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio is the only financial covenant requirement under our credit facility and is triggered when there are any commitments or obligations outstanding and availability falls below or an event of default exists  at which time the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio must be at least to as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio for the last twelve months was to 
table of contents our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by all accounts receivable  inventory and cash

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we currently are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that would require disclosure under this section 
environmental our operating facilities are subject to rigorous federal and state environmental regulation governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management 
our goal is continuous compliance with all environmental regulations and we regularly monitor our activities to ensure compliance with all pertinent rules and requirements 
compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires periodic capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs as rules change 
of our manufacturing sites  were audited for environmental compliance by outside auditors in no material issues were identified during these audits 
in  we will have three outside audits conducted 
our goal is that each of our manufacturing facilities will undergo a detailed environmental audit by an outside party at least once every three years 
during the next two to four years  our tissue manufacturing and converting facility located in neenah  wisconsin will become regulated under a reduced waste water discharge limit associated with a total maximum daily limit promulgated for the facility s receiving water 
the specific requirements of this new regulation are presently unknown 
a new federal standard for hazardous air pollutants from boiler and process heaters was proposed and subsequently delayed in by the us environmental protection agency  or epa 
the most recent communication from the epa is that this new standard will become effective in our sites at lewiston  idaho and menominee  michigan are expected to be affected by this new rule  although the impacts of this new rule are uncertain at this time 
the epa is also currently reviewing the risks associated with hazardous air pollutants from kraft paper mills 
any changes to these rules would impact our operations in lewiston  idaho and cypress bend  arkansas 
concern over climate change  including the impact of global warming  has led to significant regulatory and legislative initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
in  the united states supreme court ruled that the epa was authorized to regulate carbon dioxide under the clean air act 
as a consequence  the epa initiated a series of regulatory efforts aimed at addressing greenhouse gases as pollutants  including finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health  implementing mandatory greenhouse gas emission reporting requirements applicable to some of our manufacturing operations  and promulgating rules to limit the growth in greenhouse gases from new projects at certain types of facilities applicable to some of our manufacturing sites 
it is unclear what the overall effect of us greenhouse gas regulation will have on our operations until final rules are promulgated 
legislation has also been proposed to address greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change  including cap and trade programs  and some form of federal climate change legislation or additional federal regulation is possible 
it is not yet known when and to what extent these and other federal  state and international legislative and policy activities may come into force  how they may relate to each other in the future  or how they may affect our operations 
our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that situations that may give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered or that the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations will not require significant expenditures by us 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the results of operations and financial position 
the selection and application of those policies requires management to make difficult  subjective 
table of contents and complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
as a result  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
see note recently adopted and prospective accounting standards to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding recently adopted and new accounting pronouncements 
goodwill and intangibles 
our recent acquisition of cellu tissue was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance 
in accordance with the accounting guidance  we revalued the assets and liabilities acquired at their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period affecting the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual results versus estimates  could have a material impact on our earnings 
goodwill from an acquisition represents the excess of the cost of a business acquired over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
as a result of our acquisition of cellu tissue  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   which has not been subsequently adjusted through december  goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and at any time when events suggest impairment may have occurred 
when required  our goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of the consumer products reporting unit to its carrying value 
we incorporate assumptions involving future growth rates  discount rates and tax rates in projecting the future cash flows 
in the event the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
long lived assets 
a significant portion of our total assets are invested in our manufacturing facilities 
also  the cyclical patterns of our businesses cause cash flows to fluctuate by varying degrees from period to period 
as a result  long lived assets are a material component of our financial position with the potential for material change in valuation if assets are determined to be impaired 
we account for impairment of long lived assets in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  regarding impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this guidance requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  as measured by its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
we use our operational budgets to estimate future cash flows 
budgets are inherently uncertain estimates of future performance due to the fact that all inputs  including net sales  costs and capital spending  are subject to frequent change for many different reasons 
because of the number of variables involved  the interrelationship between the variables and the long term nature of the impairment measurement  sensitivity analysis of individual variables is not practical 
budget estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changing business conditions  and operations are reviewed  as appropriate  for impairment using the most current data available 
we believe we have adequate support for the carrying value of all of our long lived assets based on anticipated cash flows that will result from our estimates of future demand  pricing  and production costs  assuming certain levels of capital expenditures 
pension and postretirement employee benefits 
the determination of pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations and the rate of return on plan assets 
for other postretirement employee benefit  or opeb  plans  which provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to qualified retired employees  critical assumptions in determining opeb expense are the discount rate applied to benefit obligations and the assumed health care cost trend rates used in the calculation of benefit obligations 

table of contents note to our consolidated financial statements includes information for the three years ended december   and  on the components of pension and opeb expense and the underlying actuarial assumptions used to calculate periodic expense  as well as the funded status for our pension and opeb plans as of december  and the discount rate used in the determination of pension benefit obligations and pension expense is determined based on a review of long term high grade bonds and management s expectations 
at december   we calculated obligations using a discount rate 
the discount rates used at december  and were and  respectively 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension assets  we employ a process that analyzes historical long term returns for various investment categories  as measured by appropriate indices 
these indices are weighted based upon the extent to which plan assets are invested in the particular categories in arriving at our determination of a composite expected return 
the long term rates of return used for the years ended december    and were  and  respectively 
total periodic pension plan expense in was million 
an increase in the discount rate or the rate of expected return on plan assets  all other assumptions remaining the same  would decrease pension plan expense  and conversely  a decrease in either of these measures would increase plan expense 
as an indication of the sensitivity that pension expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the assumption for expected return on plan assets would affect annual plan expense by approximately million 
the actual rates of return on plan assets may vary significantly from the assumptions used because of unanticipated changes in financial markets 
our company sponsored pension plans were underfunded by million at december  and million at december  as a result of being underfunded  we are required to make contributions to our qualified pension plans 
in  we contributed million to these pension plans 
we also contributed million to our non qualified pension plan in our cash contributions in are estimated to be approximately million 
for our opeb plans  expense for was million 
we do not anticipate funding our opeb plans in except to pay benefit costs as incurred during the year by plan participants 
the discount rate used to calculate opeb obligations  which was determined using the same methodology we used for our pension plans  was  and at december   and  respectively 
the assumed health care cost trend rates used to calculate opeb obligations and expense were and  respectively  in  with both grading to over approximately years 
as an indication of the sensitivity that opeb expense has to the discount rate assumption  a basis point change in the discount rate would affect plan expense by approximately million 
a change in the assumption for health care cost trend rates would have affected plan expense by approximately to million and the total postretirement employee obligation by approximately to million 
the actual rates of health care cost increases may vary significantly from the assumption used because of unanticipated changes in health care costs 
periodic pension and opeb expenses are included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expense is allocated to all business segments 
in accordance with current accounting guidance governing defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  at december  and  long term assets are recorded for overfunded plans and liabilities are recorded for underfunded plans 
the funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation 
for underfunded plans  the estimated liability to be payable in the next twelve months is recorded as a current liability  with the remaining portion recorded as a long term liability 
effective december   the salaried pension plan was closed to new entrants and after december   it was frozen and ceased accruing further benefits 
in  we recorded a loss of million related to the closing of the salaried pension plan 
in addition  we recorded a million decrease in our pension liability 

table of contents income taxes 
the conclusion that deferred tax assets are realizable is subject to certain assessments  projections and judgments made by management 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable  the standard we use is whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry forward periods  projected taxable income  and amounts of taxable income we would have generated historically if we had been a stand alone company in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax asset  we will need to generate future taxable income before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
based on existing deferred tax liabilities and projected taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these future deductible differences  excluding items for which we have already recorded a valuation allowance 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced 
we have tax jurisdictions located in many areas of the united states and canada and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  management exercises judgment in estimating the potential exposure to unresolved tax matters and applies the guidance pursuant to uncertain tax positions which employs a more likely than not criteria approach for recording tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
while actual results could vary  in management s judgment  we have adequate tax accruals with respect to the ultimate outcome of such unresolved tax matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our exposure to market risks on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rates applied to borrowings under the credit facility are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
for example  a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates  based on assumed outstanding credit facility borrowings of million  would have a million annual effect on interest expense 
we currently do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short term interest rate fluctuations on our credit facility borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments 
commodity risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in natural gas commodity pricing  which we have  from time to time  partially mitigated through the use of firm price contracts for a portion of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
as of december   we had no firm price contracts for natural gas 
we are also subject to commodity price risk associated with pulp costs and take advantage of spot prices on pulp to minimize market risk arising from changes in pulp costs 
we have agreements with pulp vendors to purchase pulp at market based prices over the next year covering approximately of our current expected total annual pulp needs 
foreign currency risk we have minimal foreign currency exchange risk 
virtually all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
due to our canadian operations  however  we could be adversely affected by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
