the passing of legislation banning or limiting the fees we receive for transactions conducted on our atms would severely impact our revenues 
despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at atms in the united states since their introduction in  consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees 
even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of santa monica  california  federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds 
although section of the dodd frank act passed in july contains a provision that will limit the application of federal preemption with respect to state laws that do not discriminate against national banks  federal preemption will not be affected by local municipal laws  where such proposed bans or limits often arise 
more recently  some federal officials have expressed concern that surcharge fees charged by banks and non bank atm operators are unfair to consumers 
to that end  an amendment proposing limits on the fees that atm operators  including financial institutions  can charge consumers was introduced in the united states senate  but was not ultimately included in the final version of the dodd frank act that was signed into law 
if similar proposed legislation were to be enacted in the future  and the amount we were able to charge for consumers to use our atms was reduced  our revenues and related profitability would be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if such limits were set at levels that are below our current or future costs to operate our atms  it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate under our current business model 
in the united kingdom  the treasury select committee of the house of commons published a report regarding surcharges in the atm industry in march following this report  this committee was formed to investigate public concerns regarding the atm industry  including adequacy of disclosure to atm customers regarding surcharges  whether atm providers should be required to provide free services in low income areas  and whether to limit the level of surcharges 
while the committee made numerous recommendations to parliament regarding the atm industry  including that atms should be subject to the banking code a voluntary code of practice adopted by all financial institutions in the united kingdom  the united kingdom government did not accept the committee s recommendations 
despite the rejection of the committee s recommendations  the united kingdom government sponsored an atm task force to look at social exclusion in relation to atm services 
as a result of the task force s findings  approximately additional free to use atms to be provided by multiple atm providers were required to be installed in low income areas throughout the united kingdom 
while this was less than a increase in free to use atms throughout the united kingdom  there is no certainty that other similar proposals will not be made and accepted in the future 
if the legislature or another body with regulatory authority in the united kingdom were to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in the united kingdom would be negatively impacted 
in mexico  surcharging for off premise atms was legalized in late  but was not formally implemented until july in early october  the central bank of mexico adopted new rules regarding how atm operators disclose fees to consumers 
the objective of these rules was to provide more transparency to the consumer regarding the cost of a specific atm transaction  rather than to limit the amount of fees charged to the consumer 
such rules  which became effective in may  required atm operators to elect between receiving interchange fees from card issuing banks or surcharge fees from consumers 
cardtronics mexico elected to assess a surcharge fee on the consumer rather than select the interchange fee only option  and subsequently raised the level of its surcharge fees in order to recoup the interchange fees it is no longer receiving 
since the new fee structure became effective  the number of surcharge withdrawal transactions conducted on cardtronics mexico s atms has substantially declined on a same store basis  and  to date  there has been no indication that suggests transaction levels will recover to levels experienced prior to the new rules being in effect 
at the current transaction levels  the additional surcharge fee amounts at a number of cardtronics mexico s atms are not sufficient to offset the lost interchange revenues  which has resulted in lower revenues and profitability per atm in that market 
as a result of the above developments  we have reduced our atm deployments in mexico in order to better measure the impact of the above rules on our atm transaction levels and related profits 
in  we reached an agreement with banorte to provide certain services to a segment of our atms in mexico in exchange for branding rights on these atms 
based on early analysis  it appears that our new branding relationship with banorte has helped improve the profitability of our mexico business 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to continue to mitigate the effects of the new rules in mexico  our overall profitability in that market will decline and we may be required to record an impairment charge in future periods to write down the carrying value of certain existing tangible and intangible assets associated with that operation 
furthermore  one of our primary merchant contracts in mexico requires us to install a certain number of atms within a specified period of time in order to maintain exclusive rights to deploy atms at their retail locations 
as a result of the negative effects of the recent regulatory changes to the cardtronics mexico business and our decision to reduce our atm deployments  we could lose our exclusivity rights with this merchant 
potential new currency designs may require modifications to our atms that could severely impact our cash flows 
on november   a us district court judge ruled that the united states currencies as currently designed violate the rehabilitation act  a law that prohibits discrimination in government programs on the basis of disability  as the paper currencies issued by the united states are identical in size and color  regardless of denomination 
as a consequence of this ruling  the united states treasury conducted a study to determine the options to make united states paper currency accessible to the blind or visually impaired 
it is our understanding that the bep received that study on or about july   and together with the united states treasury and the federal reserve  are reviewing the study 
upon the completion of that review  these institutions will publish their recommendations and thereafter seek public comments in writing and at public forums on those recommendations 
following the public comment period  a final recommendation will be made to the secretary of the treasury  who has authority to change the design and features of the currency notes utilized in the united states 
while it is still uncertain at this time what impact  if any  this process will have on the atm industry including us  it is possible that any changes made to the design of the paper currency notes utilized in the united states could require us to incur additional costs  which could be substantial  to modify our atms in order to store and dispense such notes 
noncompliance with established eft network rules and regulations could expose us to fines and penalties and could negatively impact our results of operations 
additionally  new eft network rules and regulations could require us to expend significant amounts of capital to remain in compliance with such rules and regulations 
our transactions are routed over various eft networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and to provide account balances 
these networks include star  pulse  nyce  cirrus  and plus in the united states  link in the united kingdom  prosa red in mexico  and interac in canada 
eft networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions  as well as the amounts paid to us 
additionally  eft networks  including mastercard and visa  establish rules and regulations that atm providers  including ourselves  must comply with in order for member cardholders to use those atms 
failure to comply with such rules and regulations could expose us to penalties and or fines  which could negatively impact our financial results 
for example  in the united kingdom  mastercard and visa require compliance with the emv security standard 
this standard provides for the security and processing of information contained on microchips imbedded in certain debit and credit cards  known as smart cards 
in january  the central bank of mexico decided that the atms in the country should be compliant with the emv standard as well 
the date of implementation of the emv standard varies by the risk grade of the atms  with high risk atms to be compliant by february   medium risk atms by september   and low risk atms by september  in mexico  liability for fraudulent transactions conducted on atms without emv has effectively shifted to the atm operator as of february  we are in the process of upgrading all of our atms in mexico to be in compliance with the emv standard 
in october of  we were notified by a major global network that certain of our united states dollar dispensing atms usd atms in mexico were not in compliance with that network s procedures for settling us dollar denominated transactions through prosa red 
we are working with prosa red to begin offering an acceptable solution to continue operating the usd atms with some modifications to our current process 
this solution could result in a reduction of the revenues and profits we earn from the usd atms in mexico 
in the last year  mastercard announced plans that may require atm transaction acquirers to comply with the emv standard in the united states in order to process transactions over these networks or potentially face increased liability for fraudulent transaction activity 
during  visa announced plans for a liability shift to occur in on point of sale pos transactions  however  their announcement specifically excluded atm transactions 
it is possible in the future that visa will include atms in their announced liability shift 
at this time  neither mastercard nor visa are requiring mandatory upgrades to atm equipment  however  increased fraudulent activity on atms in the future or the shifting of liability for fraudulent activity on all atm transactions without emv readers  or other business or regulatory factors could cause us to upgrade or replace a significant portion of our existing us atm fleet 
the majority of the electronic debit networks over which our transactions are conducted require sponsorship by a bank 
in each of the geographic segments in which we operate  bank sponsorship is required in order to process transactions over certain networks 
in the united states  our largest geographic segment by revenues  bank sponsorship is required on the significant majority of our transactions and we currently rely on one primary sponsor bank for access to the applicable networks 
in our united kingdom segment  only international transactions require bank sponsorship 
in mexico  all atm transactions require bank sponsorship  which is currently provided by our banking partners in the country 
in canada  bank sponsorship is also required and is obtained through our relationships with third party processors 
if our current sponsor banks decide to no longer provide this service  or are no longer financially capable of providing this service as may be determined by certain networks  it may be difficult to find an adequate replacement at a cost similar to what we incur today  or potentially  we could incur a temporary service disruption for certain transactions in the event we lose or do not retain bank sponsorship 
developments in electronic financial transactions could materially reduce our transaction levels and revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the need for services offered at our devices in the future 
these developments could encompass technological changes and advancement in the areas of payments as well as physical self service financial devices  governmental actions  customer preferences  as well as other factors 
if transaction levels over our existing atm locations were to decrease as a result of one or several of these developments  our business could be adversely affected 
the passing of anti money laundering legislation could cause us to lose certain merchant accounts and reduce our revenues 
recent concerns by the us federal government regarding the use of atms to launder money could lead to the imposition of additional regulations on our sponsoring financial institutions and our merchant customers regarding the source of cash loaded into their atms 
in particular  such regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs by individual merchants who load their own cash  thereby making their atms less profitable 
accordingly  some individual merchants may decide to discontinue their atm operations  thus reducing the number of merchant owned accounts that we currently manage 
if such a reduction were to occur  we would see a corresponding decrease in our revenues 
our operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future  which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the atm and financial services industries  changes in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate  competition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses  capital expenditures  and expenses related to the expansion of sales  marketing  and operations  including as a result of acquisitions  if any  the timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill  intangible assets or long lived assets  changes in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate  changes in regulatory requirements associated with the atm and financial services industries  changes in the mix of our current services  changes in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers  and changes in the financial condition and operational execution of our key vendors and service providers 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent years  this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to personnel expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  and interest expense 
therefore  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
as such  comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing automated consumer financial services industry  and the geographical segments in which we operate 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of several of our senior executives would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain other qualified management  as well as technical and operational personnel as we grow 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel in the future  which could adversely impact our business
