item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business 
we depend on suppliers in china for almost all of our imported furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from our most significant chinese supplier could undermine our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and adversely affect our sourcing costs 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of our import purchases and the factory in china from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory currently on hand and in transit to our us warehouses in martinsville  va to adequately meet demand for approximately three months  with an up to additional three weeks available for immediate shipment from our primary asia warehouses 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our transition from suppliers located in china to lower cost suppliers in other asian countries could result in longer lead times and shipping delays which could decrease our earnings 
inflation in china has prompted us to source more of our products from lower cost suppliers in other asian countries  such as vietnam and indonesia  and we expect this transition to intensify 
this transition involves significant planning and coordination on our part and on the part of our suppliers in these countries 
despite our best efforts and those of our sourcing partners  these transition efforts are likely to result in longer lead times and shipping delays which could decrease our earnings 
if demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and we respond by realigning manufacturing  our near term earnings could decrease 
our domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
we may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 
we may experience impairment of our long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate  but at least annually 
at january  we had million in net long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks and trade names 
the outcome of annual impairments tests could result in the write down of all or a portion of the value of these assets 
a write down of our assets would  in turn  reduce our earnings and net worth 
over the past three fiscal years  we have written down approximately million in long lived assets 
it is possible that we will have additional write downs in the future  resulting in additional reductions to our earnings and net worth 
factors which may lead to additional write downs of our long lived assets include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  
table of contents a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we may not be able to maintain or to raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs 
competitive and market forces could prohibit future successful price increases of our products in order to offset increased costs of finished goods  raw materials  freight and other product related costs  which could lower our earnings 
the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our business and result in lower sales  earnings and net worth 
we are in the process of implementing a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations 
our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
this implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems 
these costs and risks include  but are not limited to significant capital and administrative expenditures  disruptions to our domestic and international supply chains  the inability to fill customer orders  the inability to process payments to suppliers  vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner  the disruption of our internal control structure  the inability to fulfill our sec reporting requirements in a timely manner  the inability to fulfill federal and state tax filing requirements in a timely manner  and increased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives 
the interruption or failure of our information systems or information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 
our information systems software and information technology hardware infrastructure platforms and those of third parties providing these services to us  facilitate and support every facet of our business  including the sourcing of raw materials and finished goods  planning  manufacturing  warehousing  customer service  shipping  accounting and human resources 
our systems and those of third parties providing services to us are also vulnerable to disruption or damage caused by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  power disruptions or outages  natural disasters  computer system or network failures  viruses or malware  physical or electronic break ins  unauthorized access and cyber attacks 
if these information systems are interrupted or fail  our operations may be adversely affected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
economic downturns could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is particularly sensitive to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  hooker s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales or earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  the availability of consumer credit and geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on our company 
a recovery in the company s sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn due to the postponable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases 

table of contents we may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
hooker competes with many domestic and foreign residential furniture sources 
some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign sources has increased dramatically over the past decade 
we may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value and styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of our competitors 
in addition  some large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from asian furniture factories 
over time  this practice may expand to smaller retailers 
as a result  we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes  as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles 
if we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations  failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our sales and earnings 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to hooker by a customer whose business fails  or is failing  may become uncollectible 
our ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies 
we are primarily a residential furniture design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities 
our ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing our products 
we must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since we are completely dependent on offshore suppliers for case goods furniture products  we must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing suppliers 
we must also continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect our ability to grow sales and earnings 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in us dollars  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
our dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect our ability to service customers  which could lower sales and earnings 
we rely exclusively on offshore suppliers for our casegoods furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
our offshore suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if our suppliers do not meet our specifications  we may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs issues  labor issues  decreased availability of shipping containers and or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products 
our failure to timely fill customer orders during an extended business interruption for a major offshore supplier  or due to transportation issues  could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and earnings 

table of contents we rely on offshore sourcing for all of our casegoods furniture products  and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
as a result  we are subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as in laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we source our products could have an adverse impact on our performance 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings 
for example beginning in  the us department of commerce has imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
fluctuations in the price  availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase costs  any of which could decrease our sales or earnings 
we use various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
we may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to our customers due to competition and market pressures 
we may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies  which could disrupt our business  dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock 
we may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages 
however  we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
we may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business 
we may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination of these 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share

overview we design and import high quality casegoods and certain upholstered furniture 
we also domestically manufacture upholstered furniture in order to offer quick turnaround on orders for custom leather and fabric upholstered seating 
beginning in  and to a greater degree in the fall of  the home furnishings industry saw significant declines in demand for its products due to a variety of factors including low levels of consumer confidence  difficult housing and mortgage markets  high unemployment and volatile financial markets 
discretionary purchases of furniture  particularly at the middle and upper middle price points where we primarily compete  have been significantly affected by these factors 
our upholstery segment has sustained operating losses during the downturn  primarily due to the combination of significantly lower sales volumes and the high fixed cost nature of domestic manufacturing 
despite these challenges  the flexibility of our import business model has allowed us to respond proactively to difficult and changing market conditions by adjusting the types and quantities of inventory we purchase from suppliers and cover upholstery segment operating losses 
we believe that increases in our net sales over the last two fiscal years are evidence of both our ability to effectively adjust to and accommodate changing market conditions  including changing consumer tastes and demands and a slowly improving retail environment for home furnishings 
on a consolidated basis  for the fiscal year we realized a low single digit sales increase as compared to fiscal and  as a percentage of net sales as compared to the fiscal year  realized flat gross margins as a percentage of net sales  lower selling and administrative expense  higher operating income despite the write down of our upholstery segments bradington young trade name  higher other income and higher net income  despite increased income tax expense 
our fiscal results of operations are discussed in more detail below

py casegoods casegoods upholstery upholstery consolidated consolidated the consolidated net sales increase was principally due to increased unit volume and average selling prices across both our casegoods and upholstery segments 
in particular  the increase in net sales for the upholstery segment reflects increases in fabric upholstery average selling price and unit volume of and  respectively  compared to the prior fiscal year  with such increases primarily due to the mix of products shipped 

table of contents gross income and margin gross income and margin fifty two weeks ended january  net sales january  net sales change change casegoods upholstery consolidated casegoods gross margins decreased as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased product discounting partially offset by lower freight costs on imported products during the second half of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  product discounting increased approximately basis points over the prior fiscal year  primarily due to a conscious effort to reduce excess inventory 
upholstery margins increased primarily due to cost reduction efforts and higher fabric upholstery selling prices partially offset by increased raw material costs and a casualty loss expense of  related to a sprinkler malfunction at one of our warehouses during the fiscal year 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses fifty two weeks ended january  net sales january  net sales change change casegoods upholstery consolidated fiscal selling and administrative expense decreased in our casegoods segment  primarily due to lower salary related costs  due to o an insurance gain of  on company owned life insurance due to the death of a former executive during the fiscal first quarter  o realignments in our officer group  and o the reversal of an accrual for long term incentive compensation during the first quarter of fiscal  lower advertising supplies expense and sample expense  due to cost reduction measures  lower depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to decreased information systems spending on our legacy systems in anticipation of the implementation of our current erp project  and lower bad debt expense due to adjustments in our accounts receivable reserves to reflect favorable collection trends 

table of contents these decreased expenses were partially offset by higher sales and design commissions due to increased sales  a charge to write off a note receivable and a charge to write down leasehold improvements related to the relocation and consolidation of our showroom space at the international home furnishings center 
fiscal selling and administrative expenses increased as compared to the prior year in our upholstery segment primarily due to increased commissions and sales incentives due to higher sales and initiatives to drive sales volume growth  a charge to write down leasehold improvements related to the relocation and consolidation of our showroom space at the international home furnishings center  and increased sample expense incurred for swatches for new leather and fabric upholstery offerings 
these increased expenses were partially offset by decreased market expense due to cost reduction efforts and decreased advertising expense due to cost cutting measures 
operating income and margin operating margin fifty two weeks ended january  net sales january  net sales change change casegoods upholstery consolidated during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our upholstery segment recorded a non cash charge of million million  or per share  after tax to write down the value of the bradington young trade name 
we wrote down the carrying value of the bradington young trade name because of operating losses in that division over the last few years 
we believe that we ve taken the proper steps to adjust capacity and reduce cost structure 
we expect it to become a contributor to consolidated profitability during fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements on pages f and f for more information about this charge 
fiscal operating profitability increased year over year compared to fiscal due to the factors discussed above  despite the charges to write down intangibles assets

these decreases were partially offset by increased sales and design commissions due to higher sales in the fiscal period 
fiscal upholstery selling and administrative expenses increased as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased salaries and wages expense due primarily to transfers of employees into selling and administrative salaries and wages from other internal cost centers  and  to a lesser extent  overtime in upholstery product development  and increased commission expense due to higher sales in the fiscal period 
these increases were partially offset by decreased advertising and sample expense due to cost cutting measures

table of contents operating income and margin operating margin fifty two weeks ended january  net sales january  net sales change change casegoods upholstery consolidated consolidated operating margin decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in freight costs on imported products and the  casualty loss charge for a warehouse fire in our casegoods segment  and restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges in both our casegoods and upholstery segments 
these decreases were partially offset by improved margins in our upholstery segment and lower selling and administrative expenses in our casegoods segment 
excluding the effect of restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges  consolidated operating profitability in fiscal still declined year over year compared to fiscal  due to the other factors discussed above

table of contents income tax income taxes fifty two weeks ended january  net sales january  net sales change change consolidated income tax expense effective tax rate we recorded decreased income tax expense during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decline in pretax income 
the effective rate in fiscal was lower than our typical effective tax rate due to the reversal of two federal income tax penalties that had been accrued or paid in prior years  the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state loss carry forwards that occurred in fiscal  a smaller amount of subpart f income required to be included in income in fiscal  a distribution from our captive insurance subsidiary  which was treated as income for financial reporting purposes but was a return of capital for tax purposes  and an increase in the tax benefit related to company owned life insurance policies

fiscal net working capital current assets less current liabilities was essentially flat as compared to the fiscal year  primarily due to decreased inventories due to a concerted effort to reduce excess inventory  decreased prepaid expenses and other due to decreases in deferred taxes  and decreased in trade receivables due to lower sales near the end of the fiscal year 
these decreases were almost entirely offset by increased cash balances  and decreased trade accounts payable due to lower inventory purchases 
despite the fact that our net working capital in fiscal was essentially flat as compared to the prior fiscal year  our working capital ratio the relationship between our current assets and current liabilities increased at january  as compared to january   primarily due to the magnitude of the change to our total current assets as compared to the change to our total current liabilities

standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on january  any principal outstanding under the revolving credit line is due july  we factor substantially all of our domestic upholstery accounts receivable  in most cases without recourse to us 
we factor these receivables because factoring allows us to outsource the administrative burden of credit and collections functions for our upholstery operations  factoring allows us to transfer the collection risk associated with the majority of our domestic upholstery receivables to the factor  and factoring provides us with an additional  potential source of short term liquidity 
we believe that we have the financial resources including available cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  lines of credit and the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as to pay dividends on our common stock 
cash flow from operations is highly dependent on incoming order rates and our operating performance 
our case goods segment has funded upholstery segment operating losses of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that improved upholstery segment profitability will further enhance our operating cash flows in fiscal we expect to spend between million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal year to maintain and enhance our operating systems and facilities 
of these estimated amounts  we expect to spend between million to million on the implementation of our erp system and approximately million on our new showroom at the international home furnishings center 
in addition to capital spending  we expect to invest approximately million million in fiscal in order to build inventory in order to maintain customer service levels and grow sales 

table of contents enterprise resource planning during our fiscal second fiscal quarter  we began an in depth review of our current business processes and information systems and our anticipated future needs 
this review involved many of our associates from both of our divisions and took approximately six months 
based on this review  senior management concluded that we needed a common platform supporting and integrating our casegoods and upholstery businesses and processes 
after significant due diligence  including numerous in depth reviews of leading enterprise resource planning erp systems and interviews with potential erp systems implementation partners  we chose an erp systems solution and implementation partner during our fiscal fourth quarter 
implementation began during our fiscal first quarter 
we expect to implement the erp system at our casegoods division during our fiscal first half  and at our upholstery division sometime during late fiscal or early fiscal to complete the erp system implementation as anticipated  we expect to expend significant financial and human resources 
we have spent approximately million on this project through january  and anticipate spending approximately million in additional funds over the course of this project  with a significant amount of time invested by our associates 
dividends at its april  meeting  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on may  to shareholders of record at may  commitments and contractual obligations as of january   our commitments and contractual obligations were as follows cash payments due by period in thousands less than more than year years years years total deferred compensation payments operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations these amounts represent estimated cash payments to be paid to participants in our supplemental retirement income plan or srip through fiscal year  which is years after the last current srip participant is assumed to have retired 
the present value of these benefits the actuarially derived projected benefit obligation for this plan was approximately million at january  and is shown on our consolidated balance sheets  with  recorded in current liabilities and million recorded in long term liabilities 
in addition  the monthly retirement benefit for each participant  regardless of age  would become fully vested and the present value of that benefit would be paid to each participant in a lump sum upon a change in control of the company as defined in the plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information about the srip 
these amounts represent estimated cash payments due under operating leases for various office equipment  warehouse equipment and real estate utilized in our operations

standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on january  recently issued accounting pronouncements on june  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu will change the way we present comprehensive income 
we currently present comprehensive income in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements during interim periods see note  other comprehensive income  above and as a component of the statement of changes in shareholders equity in our annual financial statements 
this update eliminates the option of presenting other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in shareholder s equity and requires that an entity present the components of net income and comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the provisions of asu are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including both interim and annual periods thereafter 
asu is effective for us beginning with our fiscal first quarter ending april  this asu will only affect our financial statement presentation  consequently  there will be no impact to our consolidated balances sheets or consolidated statements of operations other than the way in which we present comprehensive income 
we are currently evaluating the presentation options allowed under this update 

table of contents on november   the financial accounting standards board issued a proposal to defer the requirement to present reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement under asu companies would still be required to adopt the other requirements contained in asu for the presentation of comprehensive income 
we are continuing to monitor developments surrounding this proposal 
strategy and outlook our strategy is to offer world class style  quality and product value as a complete residential casegoods and upholstered furniture resource through excellence in product design  global sourcing  manufacturing  logistics  sales  marketing and customer service 
we strive to be an industry leader in sales growth and profitability performance  thereby providing an outstanding investment for our shareholders and contributing to the well being of our employees  customers  suppliers and community 
additionally  we strive to nurture the relationship focused  team oriented and honor driven corporate culture that has distinguished our company for over years 
in order to successfully execute our strategy in fiscal  we must continue to develop the right product  in other words  the product the consumer wants at a price they are willing to pay  align our import supplier base with our product standards for quality  delivery  value and cost by continuing to develop existing successful supplier relationships  exiting non compliant suppliers for more promising supplier relationships in existing or new locales  and developing our asian supply team to reduce product quality issues and costs 
achieve upholstery segment profitability  build on fiscal casegoods volume and profitability increases  and implement our corporate enterprise resource planning system for our casegoods segment and substantially complete erp implementation for our upholstery segment 
to do so  we expect to develop the right product by continuing the collaboration between experienced merchants and younger members of our design team 
in fiscal  this collaboration resulted in a pinnacle design award from the american society of furniture designers and several pinnacle award nominations  better align our supplier base with our product standards for quality  delivery  value and cost by building on the strengths of our asian supply team through the effort of our new vice president asian operations  a seasoned sourcing executive with a record of success and by continuing to leverage our existing successful supplier relationships  achieve upholstery segment profitability through volume increases driven by introducing new product lines and categories  building on the success of our bradington young division s comfort home in store gallery program and whole home collections like harbor pointe and primrose hill  which include both casegoods and upholstery  and continued focus on critical cost reduction projects  build on fiscal casegoods volume and profitability increases by continued focus on offering strong product lines  reducing discounting through improved inventory management and growing our international business  and implement our erp system for our case goods division during fy and leverage our current progress and the knowledge of our associates and implementation partner to substantially complete the erp implementation for our upholstery segment 
we enter fiscal with cautious optimism 
most macroeconomic indicators appear to be continuing the long thaw that began twelve to eighteen months ago 
we expect consumer confidence and furniture retail demand to improve as we progress through fiscal we realized double digit sales increases in the fiscal first quarter 
due to our operational improvements  reduced discounting activity and more favorable freight rates  we expect to deliver better profitability on reduced sales in the fiscal first quarter 
however  certain headwinds persist  the slow rebound of the housing market  global economic instability and most recently  rising petroleum prices 
these factors continue to dampen consumer confidence  which has improved but remains below its historical average  and discretionary spending ability 
more specific to our company  the costs and risks related to changes to our imports supply chain will present significant challenges in the coming fiscal year 
vendor shifts from china to vietnam and indonesia resulted in the delay of several well placed new collections and negatively impacted fiscal fourth quarter sales 
we expect our sourcing transition from some of our vendors in china to vendors in vietnam and indonesia will continue to result in somewhat longer lead times and shipping delays  which will likely impact sales throughout the fiscal first quarter  and to a diminishing degree  the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties  as more fully discussed in item a  risk factors beginning on page and in our forward looking statements beginning on page despite these risks and uncertainties  we believe that our business model and strategy offer a unique opportunity to successfully deliver shareholder value in the coming fiscal year 
environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of our business operations  our manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
we are in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position 
our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with our environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
we participate in a voluntary industry wide environmental stewardship program referred to as enhancing furniture s environmental culture or efec 
in september of fiscal  the american home furnishings alliance granted us efec registration  recognizing the successful company wide implementation of the efec program  which includes the successful reduction of water and electricity usage  as well as recycling efforts to reduce landfill use 
critical accounting policies and estimates hooker furniture s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that actual results will deviate materially from our estimates related to our accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  we analyze the payment history of our significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general condition of the economy  we develop what we consider to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from our estimate 
valuation of inventories 
we value all of our inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of our inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of sales  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of sales and lower profitability as compared to the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
we establish an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual values may differ materially from our estimate 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets tangible assets we regularly review our property  plant and equipment for indicators of impairment  as specified in the property  plant  and equipment topic of the accounting standards codification 
although not exhaustive  this accounting guidance lists potential indicators of impairment  which we use to facilitate our review 
these potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  
table of contents a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the impairment test for our property  plant and equipment requires us to assess the recoverability of the value of the assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we principally use our internal forecasts to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows used in our impairment analyses 
these forecasts are subjective and are largely based on management s judgment  primarily due to the changing industry in which we compete  changing consumer tastes  trends and demographics  and the current economic environment 
we monitor changes in these factors as part of the quarter end review of these assets 
while our forecasts have been reasonably accurate in the past  during periods of economic instability  uncertainty  or rapid change within our industry  we may not be able to accurately forecast future cash flows from our long lived assets and our future cash flows may be diminished 
therefore  our estimates and assumptions related to the viability of our long lived assets may change  and are reasonably likely to change in future periods 
these changes could adversely affect our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of financial position 
as of january   the fair value of our property  plant and equipment was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
when we conclude that any of these assets is impaired  the asset is written down to its fair value 
any impaired assets that we expect to dispose of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less estimated cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  if we expect to dispose of the assets in one year or less 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when we commit to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits to be paid to terminated employees affected by the facility closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
we recognize liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of facilities are based on our best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
we reassess our accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 
intangible assets we own certain indefinite lived intangible assets related to bradington young  sam moore and opus designs by hooker 
we may acquire additional amortizable assets and or indefinite lived intangible assets in future asset purchases or business combinations 
the principal indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names which are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the estimated earnings and cash flow capacity of those assets 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the economic or business climate either within the furniture industry or the national or global economy  significant changes in demand for our products  loss of key personnel  and the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our intangible assets are highly subjective and judgmental and include long term growth rates  sales volumes  projected revenues  assumed royalty rates and factors used to develop an applied discount rate 
if the assumptions that we use in these calculations differ from actual results  we may realize additional impairment on our intangible assets which may have a material  adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents during the fiscal fourth quarter  we recorded a million million after tax  or per share intangible asset impairment charge to write down the value of our upholstery segment s bradington young trade name  due to operating losses in that division over the last few years and near term performance expectations 
despite this charge  we believe we ve taken the proper steps to adjust capacity and reduce the cost structure at bradington young and expect it to contribute to consolidated profitability in fiscal at january   the fair value of our bradington young trade name approximated its fair value and the fair value of our sam moore trade name was approximately  in excess of its carrying value 
concentrations of sourcing risk we source imported products through over different vendors  from separate factories  located in seven countries 
because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign factories from which we can source our imported products  we have some flexibility in the placement of products in any particular factory or country 
factories located in china are an important resource for hooker furniture 
in fiscal year  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of import purchases  and the factory in china from which we directly source the most product accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported product 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory currently on hand in and in transit to our us warehouses in martinsville  va to adequately meet demand for approximately three months  with an additional three weeks available for immediate shipment from our asia warehouse 
also  with the broad spectrum of product we offer  we believe that  in some cases  buyers could be offered similar product available from alternative sources 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for approximately six months 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources  or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in the supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
given the capacity available in china and other low cost producing countries  we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we manage our exposure to this risk through our normal operating activities 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing denominated in us dollars with our foreign suppliers  typically for periods of at least six months 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk  but could choose to do so in the future 
most of our imports are purchased from suppliers located in china 
the chinese currency floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
we generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume or profit margins during affected periods 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility would bear interest at variable rates 
in the past  we have entered into swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt instruments 
there was no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility as of january   other than standby letters of credit in the amount of million 
therefore  a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition
