the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we believe that based on market share and the number of campuses employing our products  we are a leading provider of technology and payment services to the higher education industry 
we believe that none of our competitors match our ability to provide solutions for higher education institutions financial services needs  including compliance monitoring  and  consequently  that we provide the most comprehensive suite of disbursement and payment solutions specifically designed for higher education institutions and their students 
we also provide campus communities with convenient  cost competitive and student oriented banking services  which include extensive user friendly features 
our products and services for our higher education institution clients include our onedisburse refund management disbursement service and our suite of payment transaction products and services 
through our current bank partner  the bancorp bank  we offer our oneaccount service to the students of our higher education institution clients  which includes an fdic insured deposit account  a onecard  which is a debit mastercard atm card  and other retail banking services 
as of december   more than campuses serving more than million students had purchased the onedisburse service and more than campuses serving more than million students had contracted to use one or more of our payment products and services 
we also had approximately million oneaccounts as of december  for the year ended december  total revenue was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  net income was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  adjusted ebitda was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  and adjusted net income was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately 
see supplemental non gaap financial and operating information below for definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income each non gaap measures and reconciliations to net income 
in addition  as of december   the number of oneaccounts had increased by a compounded annual growth rate of compared to december  we expect our growth to continue in the future and that our strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity for expansion 
our growth strategy includes the following elements expanding the number of contracted higher education institutions  increasing oneaccount adoption and usage rates  cross selling our products to existing clients to increase the number of institutions using each product  enhancing our products and services to create new sources of revenue  and pursuing strategic partnerships and opportunistic acquisitions 
in evaluating our results  we consider a variety of operating and financial measures 
the key metrics that we use to determine how our business is performing include i total number of students enrolled at our higher education institution clients  ii number of active oneaccounts  iii total revenue  iv adjusted ebitda  v adjusted net income  and vi net income 
see supplemental non gaap financial and operating information below for definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income each non gaap measures and reconciliations to net income 
our primary source of revenue is generated from the use of oneaccounts 
the primary factor affecting our revenue is the number of active oneaccounts  which  in turn  is significantly affected by the total number of students enrolled at our higher education institution clients 

table of contents revenue we derive revenue primarily from fees charged for the transactions that we facilitate for our higher education institution clients and our banking customers 
most of these fees are charged on a per transaction basis and  accordingly  transaction volumes significantly affect our revenue growth 
transaction volumes are generally a function of the number of students enrolled at each of our higher education institution clients  as larger student populations lead to a greater number of active oneaccounts and related banking transactions  as well as other transactions such as onedisburse based disbursements and payment transactions 
generally  we negotiate our fee rates with our higher education institution clients 
fees charged to our banking and payment transaction customers are generally set by a schedule and apply unilaterally to all customers 
fees charged for oneaccount services are collected by our bank partner as incurred and subsequently remitted to us 
fees charged on payment transactions are charged as incurred and retained by us  while fees charged in respect of our onedisburse product are billed to our higher education institution clients and subsequently collected from them 
we believe our revenue stream is relatively stable  recurring and predictable  as the majority of our revenue each year is generated through existing relationships with higher education institutions and their campus communities 
for example  in  including revenue generated by customers acquired through our acquisition of idc in november  we generated over of our revenue from contracts signed in prior years 
in addition  our experience is that oneaccount  disbursement and payment transaction volumes and patterns are generally similar from one period to another  resulting in a large degree of predictability 
however changes in enrollment at our higher education institution clients can have an impact on our revenues and profitability and impact the predictability of our results 
our retention rate of all higher education institution clients has been in excess of each of the past years which also helps to ensure a relatively stable  recurring and predictable revenue stream 
we divide our revenue into four categories account revenue  payment transaction revenue  higher education institution revenue and other revenue 
also  during  we initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain non sufficient fund fees and which resulted in a reduction to revenues in the year 
account revenue we generate revenue from active oneaccounts  which are opened and funded by students and other members of the campus community 
we earn revenue based on both interchange fees and account service fees 
account service fees include  for example  foreign atm fees and non sufficient fund fees 
these fees are either charged by our bank partner and remitted to us or we charge them to our customers directly 
in both december and august  we began offering new versions of the oneaccount each of which has a different fee schedule compared to the original oneaccount  including a monthly fee that is waived if certain activity requirements are met 
our bank partner charges merchants interchange fees for point of sale  or pos  purchases made with onecards and remits these fees to us 
the amount of the fee generally depends on the size of the transaction  the merchant where the purchase is made and the network through which the transaction is processed 
we earn atm fees from transactions conducted through our atms with cards other than onecards 
we also earn fees from atm transactions conducted by oneaccount holders using their onecards at atms outside of our atm network 
we earn other fees for banking services provided to oneaccount holders  including fees for conducting wire transfers  replacing lost onecards  processing international transactions  processing stop payment requests  over the counter cash withdrawals using onecards  issuing official checks and electronic bill pay features 
our bank partner charges non sufficient funds fees and remits them to us when oneaccount holders attempt to withdraw or transfer money from their oneaccounts in excess of their deposited funds 
these non sufficient funds fees are primarily assessed on electronic transfers from  and checks drawn on  accounts in excess of available funds 
prior to the third quarter of  our bank partner also assessed these fees on overdrafts on debit card transactions 
however  the federal reserve board amended regulation e to limit the ability of financial institutions  effective july   to assess an overdraft fee for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the institution s payment of overdrafts for these services 
we have not offered the opt in feature to our customers for atm or one time debit card transactions 
in the absence of debit card related non sufficient funds fees  our total non sufficient funds fees per oneaccount that our bank partner remits to us began to decrease during and continued to decrease on a comparative basis through 
table of contents while our historical experience has been that account revenue generated per oneaccount has been generally stable year over year  with total account revenue generally increasing proportionally with increases in the number of oneaccounts  the implementation of regulation e in the third quarter of along with other changes that we made to our account fee schedule in  decreased the revenue per oneaccount in compared to the same period in this trend continued through the remainder of and through notwithstanding the decrease in non sufficient fund fees  the primary influence on account revenue growth is expected to continue to be the number of active oneaccounts and the amount of refunds disbursed by our higher education institution clients 
during the fourth quarter of  for instance  account revenue on a per account basis was lower than the fourth quarter of  which we believe was the result of a smaller percentage of oneaccount holders receiving financial aid refunds in this disbursement cycle 
we believe that the main driver of the reduction in number of students receiving refunds during this time period is a slowdown in enrollment growth 
growth in the number of accounts is tied to growth in the number of students enrolled at our onedisburse higher education institution clients  which expands as new clients contract to use this product 
the average percentage of students that maintain oneaccounts at a higher education institution generally increases over the first several years after the higher education institution becomes a onedisburse client 
we believe the rate of oneaccount adoption varies  however  based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the average tenure of a student at a higher education institution  whether the higher education institution is a year or a year school or a public or private school and the mix of undergraduate and graduate students 
the number of oneaccounts has risen in each of the last three years  which has led to a compounded annual growth rate of in account revenue over this period 
while we expect the number of oneaccounts to continue to grow in the near term  there is a possibility that further legislative and regulatory changes will be enacted in the near term that may reduce account revenue 
see part i  item a 
risk factors fees for financial services are subject to increasingly intense legislative and regulatory scrutiny  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects for future growth of this report 
payment transaction revenue we generate payment transaction revenue through convenience fees charged to students  parents or other payers who make online payments to our higher education institution clients through the smartpay feature of our epayment product using a credit or debit card 
as this fee is assessed on a per transaction basis  growth in payment transaction revenue is primarily influenced by transaction volumes 
we acquired our epayment product when we purchased idc in november higher education institution revenue our higher education institution clients pay fees for the products and services they purchase from us 
we charge our clients i an annual subscription fee based on the size of their student population  ii a per transaction fee  or iii a combination of both 
for certain payment transaction products  we also charge an implementation fee  which is deferred and recognized over the estimated client relationship period  which we currently estimate to be five years 
the composition of our higher education institution revenue changed substantially with our acquisition of idc in november  with a large proportion of this revenue stream now being derived from our payment products related revenue 
prior to the acquisition of idc  our revenue from higher education institutions had been primarily comprised of carding and transaction fees related to our onedisburse product 
the number of students enrolled at client institutions and the number of campuses under contract are significant drivers of our higher education institution revenue 
as we have expanded the number of our institution clients over the last three years  our higher education institution revenue has grown by a compounded annual rate of 
we expect that future increases in our institution client base will also result in increases in our higher education institution revenue 
other revenue other revenue consists of two main components a marketing incentive fee paid by mastercard based on transaction volumes and new onecard issuances  and processing fees paid by our bank partner based on the total amount of deposits held in our oneaccounts and prevailing interest rates 
because the amount of the processing fee is in part a function of prevailing interest rates  this revenue stream has historically fluctuated in accordance with interest rate movements 
since  fees paid by our bank partner have been relatively small due to low interest rates 
if prevailing interest rates rise  our processing fee will also increase 
currently  this revenue stream is immaterial to our overall results of operations 
customer credit plan in december  we voluntarily initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately million in the insufficient funds fees that are credited to customers under this plan were originally assessed beginning in cost and expenses employee compensation and related expenses represent our largest single expense 
we allocate compensation and other related expenses  including stock based compensation  to cost of revenue  product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
while we expect the number of our employees to increase over time  we believe that economies of scale in our business model will allow us to grow our compensation and related expenses at a lower rate than revenue 

table of contents other costs and expenses include outsourced managed hosting  data processing  atm related expenses  professional services  office lease payments  travel and amortization 
the following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of data processing expenses  interchange expenses related to smartpay and atm transactions  customer service expenses  uncollectible fees  write offs and amortization of implementation fees 
these expenses are shared across our different revenue categories and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue 
consequently  all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the cost of revenue category in our statements of operations 
these expenses generally move in line with the number of active oneaccounts and transaction volumes for our banking and payment transactions services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include finance  legal  compliance  facility and administration costs  as well as components of operational costs such as atm cash services and maintenance  data center costs and costs associated with our information technology 
these costs include employee compensation and related expenses  as well as fees for professional services 
as a newly public company  we started to incur additional general and administrative expenses in and throughout as a result of our need to comply with the ongoing legal and regulatory requirements associated with being a public company  including sec reporting obligations  director and officer liability insurance and other expenses 
product development product development expenses include costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancements for our proprietary technology platform and other aspects of our service offerings 
product development costs primarily relate to employee compensation 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include costs of acquiring new institution clients and educating their students about our services in order to improve the adoption and usage rates of our oneaccount and our other student oriented products and services 
the majority of our sales and marketing expenses are comprised of stock based customer acquisition expense we record in connection with acquisition of educard in and pursuant to a related intellectual property purchase agreement 
the amount of stock based customer acquisition expense depends on the number of shares released from escrow and the value of the shares at that time 
the remainder of the sales and marketing costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation 
each of our sales representatives earns i a base salary  ii sales commissions  which are earned upon the signing of a contract with a higher education institution client  and iii generally  certain trailing commissions  which are based on account performance 
we also recorded cash based customer acquisition expense in connection with our acquisition of idc in november both of the agreements related to our stock based and cash based customer acquisition expense expired at the end of  and we do not expect expense in future periods related to these agreements 
idc acquisition in november  we acquired idc  a leader in providing cashiering and payment solutions in higher education 
this transaction provided us with our suite of payment transaction products and services  the capability to offer our higher education institution clients a full complement of services and nearly doubled the number of campuses with which we have relationships 
at the time of the acquisition  there was a overlap of students enrolled at institutions that used both higher one and idc products and services 
our overlap has increased to approximately as of december  and we expect our overlap to continue to increase as a result of additional cross selling efforts 
we purchased idc for million  which was financed by cash and debt 
at closing  we made an initial payment of million 
the remaining non interest bearing post closing payment of million was due to the former shareholders in quarterly payments through december  during  we made one payment of million to the former shareholders and deposited the remaining million in an escrow account as a result of a dispute that arose between hoi and the former stockholders of hoi 
on april   hoi and the former stockholders of idc agreed to a settlement  which resulted in million of the amount held in escrow being paid to hoi and the remaining amount being paid to the former stockholders of idc 
we recorded the impact of the settlement agreement in the quarter ending june  the million returned from escrow to us was recorded as other income of million  reflecting a payment made under the indemnification provisions of the stock purchase agreement and a reduction of general and administrative expenses of million  reflecting the recovery of certain legal costs incurred for the litigation 
see also part i  item legal proceedings of this report 
in acquiring idc  we purchased its payment transaction suite of products and services  such as epayment  ebill  mypaymentplan  emarket and cashiering  which we did not previously offer

table of contents critical accounting policies a number of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management  and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in applying these policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  management s observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our consolidated financial statements 
the following areas represent our critical accounting policies provision for operational losses stock based compensation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes business combinations information about these critical accounting policies is included in note significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the report and to the extent different is also included below 
provision for operational losses since our reserve is established based upon an analysis of outstanding overdrafts and historical repayment rates  if the financial condition of our accountholders were to deteriorate  thereby reducing their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets we have one operating segment and reporting unit for purposes of our goodwill testing as a result of the integrated way that the entire business is managed 
as of the completion of our impairment test on october   our reporting unit was not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
we performed the annual impairment test during with a qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was not less than its carrying value 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
we consider a number of factors  including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows 
differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge and thus materially different results of operations 
stock based compensation the options we grant expire ten years from the date of grant 
options for our employees vest over periods ranging from one month to five years  with the majority vesting as follows one fifth of the granted options vest one year from the date of grant  the remaining four fifths vest at a rate of per month over the remaining four years of the vesting period 
the board grants primarily incentive stock options  but occasionally grants nonqualified stock options to key members of management 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate option forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
restricted stock is a stock award that entitles the holder to receive shares of our common stock as the award vests over time 
the board granted restricted stock awards for the first  and to date only  time in when it granted a total of  shares to its executive officers 
these awards vest over four years which start on the first anniversary of the grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock award is estimated using the intrinsic value method that is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 

table of contents generally  employees have received stock option grants when joining the company and then may have received periodic awards thereafter in the discretion of the board and management  although the timing of additional awards has previously not been made according to any established policy 
the board intends all options to be granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant 
on each of the grant dates up until our common stock offering in june  the fair value of common stock underlying stock options granted was either estimated by the board on a contemporaneous basis with input from management and an independent valuation firm or was determined not to have changed since a prior valuation 
given the absence of a public trading market in our common stock through june  our board considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which stock option grants were approved 
these factors included  but were not limited to  the following developments in our business  issuances of our preferred stock  the rights and preferences of our convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock  independent valuations of our common stock  the lack of marketability of our common stock  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event  given prevailing market conditions  the per share value of any recent preferred stock financing and the amount of convertible preferred stock liquidation preferences  our current and historical operating performance and current financial condition  our operating and financial projections  the stock price performance of a peer group comprised of selected publicly traded companies identified as being comparable to us  and economic conditions and trends in the broad market for stocks 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates regarding the value of our stock at the time of the options being granted  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
we believe that the board used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock 
we requested periodic valuation reports from an independent valuation firm  prepared consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation in and up until our common stock offering in june each valuation recommended a fair value of our common stock on a minority  non marketable basis as of the date of the report 
in valuing our common stock  our independent valuation firm determined our business enterprise value using two valuation approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates the present value of future estimated debt free cash flows  based upon forecasted revenue and costs 
these discounted cash flows are added to the present value of our estimated enterprise terminal value  the multiple of which is derived from comparable company market data 
these future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a rate corresponding to our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the discount rate is derived from an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of our publicly traded peer group as well as cost of capital studies for similar stage companies as of the valuation date and is adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in our cash flows 
the market approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
a multiple of key metrics implied by the enterprise values or acquisition values of our publicly traded peers is calculated 
based on the range of these observed multiples  size of the company  company specific factors such as growth and margins  and professional judgment a appropriate adjustment to the publicly traded companies median multiple is applied our metrics in order to derive an indication of value 
after determining a business enterprise value indication under each approach  the enterprise value was allocated to debt holders and then to each of our classes of stock using a liquidation analysis that took into consideration each class of shareholder s rights and preferences to proceeds 
under each of the value indications based on the shareholder agreements  the preferred shareholders would automatically convert to common shareholders 
the two per share value indications were weighted to determine the concluded fair value of a share of common stock on a minority  non marketable basis 
upon our common stock offering in june  we have relied upon the trading price of our common stock to determine fair value of our common stock 

table of contents grants in and with respect to equity grants made in and up until our initial public offering in june  the key assumptions in the common stock valuations recommended by an independent valuation firm were as follows date of valuation discounted cash flows method guideline public company weighting discount for lack of marketability discounted cash flow discount rate common stock value june  november  march  for purposes of the june valuations  the comparable publicly traded companies utilized in the market approach consisted of alliance data systems corporation  cybersource corp  mastercard incorporated  tns inc and total systems services  inc 
the list was expanded to include visa  inc in the november valuation report and to include financial engines  inc in the march valuation report 
income taxes our deferred tax balances are dependent upon our estimation of the rates at which these deferred taxes will reduce in the future 
differences in our estimation of apportionment in future years would have an impact on the amount of deferred taxes we record as of any point in time 
business combinations in recording the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we make estimates regarding customer retention rates  discount rates and future revenues among other things 
changes in the these estimates would have an impact on the amount of value assigned to our assets acquired and therefore impact the amount of amortization that is recorded in future periods 

table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  both in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of revenue year ended december  change from prior period in thousands in thousands of dollars percentage account revenue payment transaction revenue higher education institution revenue other revenue revenues before customer credit plan less customer credit plan revenue cost of revenue gross margin general and administrative product development sales and marketing income from operations interest income interest expense other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  of revenue account revenue payment transaction revenue higher education institution revenue other revenue revenues before customer credit plan less customer credit plan revenue cost of revenue gross margin general and administrative product development sales and marketing income from operations interest income interest expense other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue account revenue the increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of  or million  in the number of oneaccounts from december  to december  greater adoption of the oneaccount at existing higher education institution clients accounted for of the increase in oneaccounts 
the remaining increase was due to students choosing the oneaccount at higher education institutions which became clients after december  the increase in the number of oneaccounts resulted in increases in interchange fees  atm fees and other fees that our bank partner remits to us 
payment transaction revenue the increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an increase in payments processed at higher education institutions that were utilizing the cashnet payment module  epayment  as of the beginning of  as well as the inclusion of new higher education institution clients that began utilizing epayment since the year ended december  higher education institution revenue the increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue for our cashnet suite of payment products 
the increase in subscription revenue is generally due to the increase in number of new modules sold to previously existing higher education institution clients  as well as sales of the cashnet suite of payment products to new higher education institution clients over the course of the last twelve months 
the increase in higher education institution revenue was also supported by growth in the financial aid disbursement revenues generated by our onedisburse refund management disbursement service 
customer credit plan in december  we initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately million in the insufficient funds fees that are credited to customers under this plan were originally assessed beginning in of the total charge of million  an accrual of approximately million has been established for amounts which are expected to be paid in the first quarter of cost of revenue our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately percentage points compared to approximately of that decrease was as a result of the credits that we agreed to provide to customers during discussed above 
the remaining decrease in margin is primarily related to higher costs associated with honoring mastercard zero liability protection to our customers 
these higher costs included approximately million of losses associated with a theft at an unrelated third party merchant which impacted our customers  which was a component of this overall increase 
general and administrative expense although general and administrative expenses continue to increase as our size grows  such expenses are increasing at a lower rate than our revenue growth 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by increases in employee compensation  professional fees  depreciation  and losses recorded on the disposal of atms 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow at a rate slower than revenue growth in the future 
sales and marketing expense the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase of million in the non cash  stock based sales acquisition expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in connection with the acquisition of educard due to a higher average share price at the date of vesting 
the remainder of the increase was the result of increases in certain marketing efforts during  including additional tradeshow participation and higher employee compensation costs to support business growth 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower amortization of deferred financing costs of the credit facility as defined below  compared to our prior credit facility that was in place during  and accretion of our acquisition payable which became fully accreted by december  during the year ended december   a zero balance was maintained on the credit facility 

table of contents other income we recorded million of other income during the year ended december   as a result of the settlement agreement reached with the former stockholders of idc  or the settlement agreement 
see part i  item legal proceedings  for additional information related to the settlement agreement 
income tax expense the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in net income before taxes 
the gain we recorded as a result of the settlement agreement with the former stockholders of idc of million did not have any tax impact for the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million as a result of a decrease in the expected rate that certain of our deferred tax liabilities will reverse  which resulted in an income tax benefit during the year ended december  the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue account revenue the increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of  or million  in the number of oneaccounts from december  to december  greater adoption of the oneaccount at existing higher education institution clients accounted for of the increase in oneaccounts  while of the increase was due to new higher education institution clients 
the increase in the number of oneaccounts resulted in increases in interchange fees relating to point of sale purchases made with our onecards  atm fees  and other fees that our bank partner remitted to us 
while our historical experience has been that account revenue generated per oneaccount has been generally stable year over year  with total account revenue generally increasing proportionally with increases in the number of oneaccounts  the implementation of regulation e in the third quarter of as well as other changes we made to our fee schedule decreased the revenue per oneaccount compared to the same period in the prior year 
this trend continued into the fourth quarter of and through payment transaction revenue the increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily generated from our cashnet payment transaction products  which were added to our product offering with the acquisition of idc in november and  accordingly  were only included in our payment transaction revenues for approximately one and one half months during the twelve months ended december  higher education institution revenue the increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of subscription and deployment revenue from our cashnet suite of products compared to only approximately days of revenue in other revenue the increase in other revenue was primarily due to an increase in the marketing incentive fees payable to us from mastercard due to higher mastercard issuance incentives 
an increase in processing fees that our bank partner paid to us  which resulted primarily from an increase in oneaccount deposits  also contributed to the growth in other revenue 
cost of revenue the inclusion of processing fees related to our cashnet payment transaction revenue for the whole year in  compared to only days in  accounted for million  or of the total growth in cost of revenue 
increases in data processing expenses of million  or  network fees and expenses of million or and customer service expenses of million  or  also contributed to the increase 
the growth in these expenses was primarily due to a increase in the number of active oneaccounts 
an increase in amortization expense  primarily related to deferred implementation costs  of million  or  was driven by both new client implementations and the inclusion of costs resulting from our cashnet deployments 
write offs and the provision for uncollectible fees increased million  or  driven by the increase in the number of active oneaccounts  which was partially offset by higher fee collection rates and lower aggregate overdrawn balances resulting from the implementation of amendments to regulation e 
the lower margin generally attained on the cashnet payment transaction revenue contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin percentage 

table of contents general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense was driven primarily by increases of million  or  in employee compensation allocated to general and administrative expenses  million  or  in depreciation and amortization  and million  or  in information technology expenses 
these expenses were the result of both the acquisition of idc in november and of growth in our existing lines of business 
additionally  professional fees increased million  or  driven by growth in the size and complexity of our business and the additional costs of operating as a publicly traded company 
product development expense the increase in product development expense was primarily due to an increase in employee and outsourced costs primarily related to the addition of product development employees from cashnet

table of contents we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to our board of directors  management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to certain items  such as interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization  stock based expenses and certain other items  that can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods  the book value of their assets  their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired  securities analysts use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies  because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time  stock based customer acquisition expense and stock based compensation expense are not key measures of our core operating performance  because our decision to institute the customer credit plan during which will provide approximately million in credits to customers does not reflect on our current performance  because the milestone bonus was a non recurring expense that we recorded upon reaching a particular long term operational target that we do not expect to incur again in the near term  the milestone bonus does not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and is therefore not a key measure of our core operating performance  because cash based customer acquisition expense is an item related to the acquisition of idc and does not reflect how our business is performing at any particular time  and because the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of our litigation with the former stockholders of idc is an item related to the acquisition of idc and does not reflect how our business is performing at any particular time

table of contents we believe adjusted net income is useful to our board of directors  management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time  stock based customer acquisition expense and stock based compensation expense are not key measures of our core operating performance  because cash based customer acquisition expense is an item related to the acquisition of idc and does not reflect how our business is performing at any particular time  because our decision to institute the customer credit plan during which will provide approximately million in credits to customers does not reflect on our current performance  because the milestone bonus was a non recurring expense that we recorded upon reaching a particular long term operational target that we do not expect to incur again in the near term  the milestone bonus does not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and is therefore not a key measure of our core operating performance  amortization expenses can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods  the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets  their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired  and because the gain we recorded in connection with the settlement of our litigation with the former stockholders of idc is an item related to the acquisition of idc and does not reflect how our business is performing at any particular time

payments due by period total less than year to years to years years all other in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations uncertain tax positions and related interest total contractual obligations we have a loan payable which has a maturity date of and in which payments commence in we lease certain property in oakland  california and atlanta  georgia under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases in oakland and atlanta are due to expire in january and september  respectively 
purchase obligations include minimum amounts committed under contracts for services 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of such liability and interest payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  change in our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
recent accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact  if any  that the adoption of each such standard will have 
as of the filing of this report  there were no new accounting standards issued that we expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk relates to interest rate sensitivity  which is the risk that future changes in interest rates will reduce our net income or net assets 
our credit facility accrues interest at a rate equal to a base rate or eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin depending on higher one  inc s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
based upon a sensitivity analysis at january   assuming average outstanding borrowings during the year ended december  of million  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of million 
in addition  we receive processing fees paid from our bank partner  based on prevailing interest rates and the total deposits held in our oneaccounts 
since  fees paid by our bank partner have been relatively small because of low interest rates 
a change in interest rates would affect the amount of processing fees that we earn and therefore would have an effect on our revenue  cash flows and results of operations
