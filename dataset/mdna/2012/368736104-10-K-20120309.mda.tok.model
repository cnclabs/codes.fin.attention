item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate reorganization 
our products we design  engineer and manufacture generators with an output of between w and mw  as well as other engine powered products such as light towers  pumps and power washers 
in the manufacturing process  we design  manufacture  source and modify engines  alternators  transfer switches and other components necessary to production 
we classify our products into three classes based on similar range of power output geared for varying end customer uses residential power products  commercial and industrial power products  and other products 
the following summary outlines our portfolio of products  including their key attributes and customer applications 
residential power products our automatic residential standby generators range in output from kw to kw  with manufacturer s suggested retail prices  or msrps  from approximately  to  they operate on either natural gas or liquid propane and are permanently installed with an automatic transfer switch  which we also manufacture 
air cooled residential standby generators range in outputs from kw to kw  are available in steel and aluminum enclosures and serve as an emergency backup for small to medium homes 
liquid cooled generators serve as emergency backup for larger homes and small businesses and range in output from kw to kw 
liquid cooled brands include the guardian series and the premium quietsource series  which have a quiet  low speed engine and a standard aluminum enclosure 
we provide portable generators fueled by gasoline that range in size from w to  w 
these products serve as an emergency home backup and are used for construction and recreational purposes 
following the expiration of a non compete agreement in  we expanded our portable product offering to introduce portable generators below  w 
we currently have four portable product lines the gp series  targeted at homeowners  ranging from  w to  w  the xg series  targeted at the premium homeowner markets  ranging from  to  w  the xp series  targeted at the professional contractor market  ranging from  to  w  and the ix series  targeted at the recreational market  ranging from w to  w 
with our acquisition of gen tran in february  we now offer manual transfer switches to supplement our portable generator product offering 

table of contents residential power products comprised  and  respectively  of total net sales in  and industrial and commercial power products our light commercial standby generators include a full range of affordable generators from kw to kw and related transfer switches  providing three phase power sufficient for most small and mid sized businesses including grocery stores  convenience stores  restaurants  gas stations  pharmacies  retail banks and small health care facilities 
our light commercial generators run on natural gas or liquid propane thereby eliminating the fuel spillages  spoilage  environmental or odor concerns common with traditional diesel units 
we manufacture a broad line of standard and configured standby generators and related transfer switches for industrial applications 
our single engine industrial generators range in output from kw to kw with our modular power system mps technology extending our product range up to mw 
we offer four fuel options including diesel  natural gas  liquid propane or bi fuel 
bi fuel generators operate on a combination of both diesel and natural gas to allow our customers the advantage of multiple fuel sources and extended run times 
these units are primarily used as emergency backup for large healthcare  telecom  datacom  commercial office  municipal and manufacturing customers 
our mps technology combines the power of several smaller generators to produce the output of a larger generator  providing our customers with redundancy and scalability in a cost effective manner 
for larger industrial applications  our mps products offer customers an efficient  affordable way to scale their standby power needs 
by offering a series of smaller generac generators integrated with generac s proprietary powermanager control system  we provide a lower cost alternative to traditional large  single engine generators 
the mps product line also offers superior reliability given its built in redundancy which allows individual units to be taken off line for routine maintenance while retaining coverage for critical circuits 
we provide the telecommunications market our full range of generator systems  ranging from kw air cooled generators to mw mps 
our light towers and mobile generators provide temporary lighting and power for various end markets  such as road and commercial construction  energy  mining  military and special events 
we also manufacture mobile pumps which utilize wet and dry priming pump systems for a wide variety of wastewater applications 
industrial and commercial power products comprised  and  respectively  of total net sales in  and other power products we sell aftermarket service parts to our dealers and proprietary engines to third party original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we also sell rv generators  which are available in gasoline  liquid propane and diesel fuel models  directly to oems as well as aftermarket dealers 
other power products comprise  and  respectively  of total net sales in  and distribution channels and customers we distribute our product through several channels to increase awareness of our product categories and the generac and magnum brands  and to ensure our products reach a broad customer base 
this distribution network includes independent residential and industrial dealers  wholesalers  national accounts  private label arrangements  retailers  catalogs  e commerce merchants  equipment rental companies  equipment dealers and construction companies 
we believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that has strengthened over the last decade by expanding our network from our base of industrial dealers to include other channels of distribution as product offerings have increased 
our network is well balanced with no single sales channel providing more than of our sales and no customer providing more than of our sales in 
table of contents our dealer network  which is located principally in the united states and canada  is the industry s largest network of independent generator contractors 
our residential commercial dealer network sells  installs and services our residential and light commercial products to end users 
we have developed a number of proprietary dealer management programs to evaluate  manage and incentivize our dealers  which we believe has an important impact on the high level of customer service we provide to end customers 
these programs include both technical and sales training  under which we train new and existing dealers about our products  service and installation 
we regularly perform market analyses to determine if a given market is either under served or has poor residential dealer representation 
within these locations  we selectively add distribution or invest resources in existing dealer support and training to improve dealer performance 
our industrial dealer network provides industrial and commercial end users with on going  local and nationwide product support 
our industrial dealers maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors  specifying engineers and national account regional buying offices 
our sales group works in conjunction with our industrial dealers to ensure that national accounts receive engineering support  competitive pricing and nationwide service 
we promote our industrial generators through the use of product demonstrations  specifying engineer education events  dealer forums and training 
in recent years  we have been particularly focused on expanding our dealer network in latin america in order to expand our international sales opportunities 
our wholesaler network consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses for electrical and hvac products 
our wholesalers distribute our residential and light commercial generators and are a key introduction to the standby generator category for electrical and hvac contractors who may not be generac dealers 
on a selective basis  we have established private label and licensing arrangements with third party partners to provide residential  light commercial and industrial generators 
the partners include leading home equipment  electrical equipment and construction machinery companies  each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products 
we have agreements in place with these partners having terms of between three and four years and further establishing additional terms and conditions of these arrangements 
our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations and includes regional and national home improvement chains  retailers  clubs  buying groups and farm supply stores 
these physical retail locations are supplemented by a number of catalogue and e commerce retailers 
this network primarily sells our residential standby  portable and light commercial generators 
in some cases  we have worked with our retail partners to create installation programs using our residential dealers to support the sale and installation of standby generator products sold at retail 
we also use a combination of display units and advertising through our retail accounts to promote awareness for our products 
the distribution for our mobile products includes international  national and regional equipment rental companies  equipment dealers and construction companies 
additionally  we sell certain generators and engines directly to oem manufacturers and after market dealers for use in the lawn and garden and rv markets

research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs  safety characteristics  reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with governmental standards 
we have had over years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology 
in the residential and light commercial markets  we have developed proprietary engines  cooling packages  controls  fuel systems and emissions systems 
we believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow continued diversification in our end markets 
we rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of approximately us and international patents and patent applications 
our patents expire between and and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems  air flow  electronics and controls  noise reduction and air cooled engines 
us trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed 
new us patents that are issued generally have a life of years from the date the patent application is initially filed 
we believe the existence of these patents and trademarks  along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks  protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position 
we also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment 
suppliers of raw materials our primary raw material inputs are steel  copper and aluminum  all of which are purchased from third parties and  in many cases  as part of machined or manufactured components 
we have developed an extensive network of reliable  low cost suppliers in the united states and abroad 
our strategic global sourcing function continuously evaluates the cost structure of our products and capabilities of our supply chain  and sources components accordingly based on this evaluation 
in  we sourced more than half of our components from outside the united states 
competition the market for onsite standby generators is competitive 
we face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad 
however  most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis  focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix 
we are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential  industrial and light commercial generator markets 
we believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a first mover advantage over our competition for product innovation 
we also believe our broad product offering and diverse distribution model provide for additional advantages as well 
in the market for standby commercial and industrial generators  our primary competitors are caterpillar  cummins  kohler and mtu  most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers 
in the market for residential standby generators  our primary competitors include briggs stratton  cummins onan division and kohler  which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses 
in the portable generator market  our primary competitors include briggs stratton  honda and techtronics international tti  along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors 
in the market for mobile generators  our primary competitors are doosan ir  aggreko  caterpiller and wacker 
our competitors in the market for light towers include terex  allmand and wacker 
there are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside north america  but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets 
in a continuously evolving sector  we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation  quality  reliability  pricing  innovative features  breadth of product and product availability 

table of contents employees as of december   we had  employees  full time and part time and temporary employees 
of those   employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
these risks are not exclusive  and additional risks to which we are subject include  but are not limited to  the factors mentioned under forward looking statements and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this report 
risk factors related to our business and industry demand for our products is significantly affected by unpredictable major power outage events that can lead to substantial variations in  and uncertainties regarding  our financial results from period to period 
sales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns  and demand for our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms  hurricanes  ice storms  blackouts and other grid reliability issues 
the impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location and severity of the outages 
sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory 
the lack of major power outage events can affect our net sales in the years following a given storm season 
unpredictable fluctuations in demand are therefore part of managing our business  and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits 
despite their unpredictable nature  we believe major power outages create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products 

table of contents demand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses and other macroeconomic conditions 
our business is affected by general economic conditions  and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in us residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices 
our sales of light commercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the non residential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities 
if these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors  our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the light commercial and industrial sectors through  among other things  our focus on innovation and product development  including natural gas engine and modular technology  could be adversely affected 
in addition  consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products  and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business 
typically  we do not have contracts with our customers  and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products 
if general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen  or if the non residential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline  our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected 
additionally  timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quarter to quarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets 
decreases in the availability and quality  or increases in the cost  of raw materials and key components we use could materially reduce our earnings 
the principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel  copper and aluminum 
we also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products 
the prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand  transportation costs  government regulations and tariffs  price controls  economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control 
we do not have long term supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices 
if we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements  price increases to our customers  manufacturing productivity improvements  or hedging transactions  our profitability could be adversely affected 
also  our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers  including in some cases  suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components 
if we are unable to obtain adequate  cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis 
this could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 
the industry in which we compete is highly competitive  and our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies and have substantially greater financial resources 
some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us 
in addition  we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets 
demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality  to respond to downward pricing pressure  and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors 
if we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures  we could lose market share  which could have an adverse impact on our results 
for more information  see item business competition 
our industry is subject to technological change  and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business 
new products  or refinements and improvements of existing products  may have technical failures  their introduction may be delayed  they may have higher production costs than originally expected or they may not be accepted by our customers 
if we are not able to anticipate  identify  develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences  demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents we rely on independent dealers and distribution partners  and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners  or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label  telecommunications  retail or equipment rental customers  would adversely affect our business 
in addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives  we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers 
we also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands 
in addition  we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment  electrical equipment and construction machinery companies  arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies  and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers 
our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large telecommunications  retail and other customers are typically not exclusive  and many of the distributors and customers with whom we do business offer products and services of our competitors 
impairment of our relationships with our distributors  dealers or large customers  loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers  or an increase in our distributors or dealers sales of our competitors products to our customers or of our large customers purchases of our competitors products could materially reduce our sales and profits 
also  our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify  attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform  and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts 
our business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights 
we view our intellectual property rights as important assets 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements 
these protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  breaching any confidentiality agreements with us  copying or reverse engineering our products  or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own 
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business 
if it became necessary for us to litigate to protect these rights  any proceedings could be burdensome and costly and we may not prevail 
we cannot guarantee that any patents  issued or pending  will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties 
moreover  the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties intellectual property rights 
any such claim  even if it is without merit  may be expensive and time consuming to defend  subject us to damages  cause us to cease making  using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  require us to redesign our products  divert management time and attention and or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements 
furthermore  in connection with our sale of generac portable products to the beacon group in  we granted the beacon group an exclusive perpetual license for the use of the generac portable products trademark in connection with the manufacture and sale of certain engine driven consumer products 
this perpetual license was eventually transferred to briggs and stratton briggs when the beacon group sold that business to briggs 
currently  this trademark is not being used in commerce 
however  in the event that the beacon group or briggs use this trademark in the future  we could suffer competitive confusion and our business could be negatively impacted 
our operations are subject to various environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and non compliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs  fines  sanctions and claims 
our operations are subject to a variety of foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations including those governing  among other things  emissions to air  discharges to water  noise  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste and other materials 
in addition  under federal and state environmental laws  we could be required to investigate  remediate and or monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at third party sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed 
this liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused  or had any knowledge of  the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs 
violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs  fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers compensation claims 

table of contents our products are subject to substantial government regulation 
our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing  among other things  emissions and noise  including standards imposed by the federal environmental protection agency  or epa  state regulatory agencies  such as carb  and other regulatory agencies around the world 
these laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent 
changes in applicable laws or regulations  or in the enforcement thereof  could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future 
developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our projects or develop new products to comply with new regulations  particularly those relating to air emissions 
for example  we were required to modify our spark ignited air cooled gaseous engines to comply with the epa and carb regulations  as well as the continued implementation of tier nonroad diesel engine changes associated with the magnum acquisition 
typically  additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market 
while we have been able to meet previous deadlines  failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve 
we may incur costs and liabilities as a result of product liability claims 
we face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future  if at all  or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time  regardless of the ultimate outcome 
a significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed 
if our reputation is damaged  we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products  which could reduce our sales and profitability 
the loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our success depends  in part  on the efforts of certain key individuals  including the members of our senior management team  who have significant experience in the power products industry 
if  for any reason  our senior executives do not continue to be active in management  or if our key employees leave our company  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and results of operations 
although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future  the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 
disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business 
we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our non union facilities 
disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers  which could result in loss of business 
in addition  union activity could result in higher labor costs  which could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
we may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations 
while we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities  a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales and or negatively impact our financial results 
any of our manufacturing facilities  or any of our machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including equipment or information technology infrastructure failure  
table of contents disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including roads  bridges  railroad tracks  fires  floods  tornados  earthquakes  or other catastrophes  and other operational problems 
in addition  the vast majority of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in wisconsin within a mile radius 
we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in wisconsin 
in the event of a business interruption at our wisconsin facilities  we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations  accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs  among other severe consequences 
such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations 
a significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries  exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the united states 
we source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas  primarily in asia and europe 
our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with third party sourcing generally 
such risks include inflation or changes in political and economic conditions  unstable regulatory environments  changes in import and export duties  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  currency rate fluctuations  trade restrictions  labor unrest  logistical and communications challenges  and other restraints and burdensome taxes 
these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas 
in particular  if the us dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers  our cost of goods sold could increase materially  which would adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents as a us corporation that sources components in foreign countries  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act 
a determination that we violated this act may affect our business and operations adversely 
as a us corporation  we are subject to the regulations imposed by the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operating results and cash flows 
we have significant tax assets  usage of which may be subject to limitations in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes 
any subsequent accumulations of common stock ownership leading to a change of control under section of the us internal revenue code of  including through sales of stock by large stockholders  all of which are outside of our control  could limit and defer our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future federal income tax liabilities 
our total assets include goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles 
if we determine these have become impaired in the future  net income could be materially adversely affected 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
indefinite lived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names
