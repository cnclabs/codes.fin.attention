overview sciclone pharmaceuticals nasdaq scln is a revenue generating  profitable  united states us based  china focused  specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology  infectious diseases  cardiovascular  urological  respiratory  and central nervous system disorders 
we are focused on continuing international sales growth through our strong sales and marketing efforts and growing our profitability 
our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the people s republic of china china where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through our many years of experience marketing our lead product  zadaxin 
we believe our strengths position us to benefit from the expansion of the pharmaceutical market in china 
we believe china will rank second among global pharmaceutical markets by  with projected annual growth rates of or more annually over the next several years 
we seek to grow sales of our current product portfolio in the region while we leverage our strong balance sheet for future acquisitions and product in licensing 
we acquired novamed pharmaceuticals  inc novamed on april   and our results of operations include the operations of novamed as of that date forward 
we believe the novamed acquisition positions us as a leading specialty pharmaceutical company in china  with key pharmaceutical assets  new therapeutic areas of focus  an expanded management team  and a larger and stronger commercial infrastructure  including a combined sales force of over sales professionals 
we aim to expand our presence in china by increasing revenues from our key products  by in licensing additional products  and by expanding our sales force to further penetrate the market 
our broadened portfolio has marketed products and spans major therapeutic areas including oncology  infectious diseases  cardiovascular  urological  respiratory and central nervous system disorders 
the acquisition increased our portfolio of commercial and development stage products through exclusive licensing and promotion agreements with a number of leading pharmaceutical companies 
since the acquisition  we have operated in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers china and rest of the world  including the us 
we have two categories of revenues product sales revenues and promotion services revenues 
our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in licensed products  including our lead product  zadaxin  and products from pfizer inc and iroko pharmaceuticals llc 
zadaxin has the highest margins in our portfolio as it is a premium proprietary product sold exclusively by sciclone 
aggrastat  an in licensed product which we recently began selling in china  also has higher margins than our promoted products and we expect that revenues from this product will grow significantly as it further penetrates the china market 
in addition  we anticipate that new marketed products  when and if introduced  such as dc bead  tramadol  and ondansetron rapidfilm  will increase the future revenues and profitability of our growing pharmaceutical business in china over the coming years 
we recently received notification of the approval of tramadol for use in the treatment of moderate to severe pain 
see part i  item legal proceedings regarding the status of our agreement with meda pharma gmbh co 
kg regarding tramadol and other products in development 
our promotion services revenues result from fees we receive for exclusively promoting products from certain partners including sanofi and baxter international  inc in china 
we recognize promotion services revenues as a percentage of our collaborators product sales revenue for our exclusively promoted products such as depakine  stilnox  and tritace 
over time  as additional proprietary or in licensed products come to the market  we expect our product mix will shift towards those higher margin products 

table of contents sciclone s zadaxin thymalfasin is approved in over countries and may be used for the treatment of hepatitis b hbv  hepatitis c hcv  as a vaccine adjuvant  and certain cancers according to the approvals we have in these countries 
in china  thymalfasin is also included in the treatment guidelines issued by the ministry of health moh for liver cancer 
to continue to grow zadaxin sales to china  our sales force is focused on increasing sales to the country s largest hospitals class with over beds as well as midsize hospitals class 
these hospitals serve tier and tier cities located mostly in the eastern part of china which are the largest and generally have the most affluent populations 
zadaxin s list price in china is currently under review by regulatory authorities 
we anticipate that a price reduction may occur  and if a substantial reduction in the list price occurs  our revenues and gross margins for zadaxin would be substantially reduced 
the timing and extent of a zadaxin price reduction is unknown 
sciclone s marketed portfolio also includes depakine  the most widely prescribed broad spectrum anti convulsant in china  tritace  an ace inhibitor for the treatment of hypertension  stilnox  a fast acting hypnotic for the short term treatment of insomnia marketed as ambien in the us  and aggrastat  an intervention cardiology product launched in sciclone is also pursuing the registration of several other therapeutic products in china 
we continue to look for in licensing opportunities of approved or late stage branded  well differentiated products that if not yet approved  have a clear regulatory approval pathway in china based on existing regulatory approval outside of china 
our preference is to in license products with higher margins that can augment our product sales revenue category  and we continue to explore opportunities to optimize our promotion services revenues category 
we are also working on the final stage of the regulatory approval in china for our in licensed candidate dc bead  and on the approval process for our other product candidates  all of which are in clinical trials or in other stages of the regulatory approval process in china 
during  we were developing scv in a phase b clinical trial for the delayed onset of oral mucositis om 
on march   we announced the discontinuation of this trial based on the pre planned interim analysis results that indicated the trial would not meet the pre specified efficacy endpoints  and our intention to further curtail our us based development efforts 
in december  we announced that the california superior court for the county of san mateo granted final approval of a settlement reached by the parties to the consolidated derivative lawsuits against certain current and former directors and officers of sciclone pharmaceuticals  and against the company as a nominal defendant 
in summary  the final settlement provides for the litigation to be dismissed with prejudice  the release of certain known or unknown claims that have been or could have been brought later in court arising out of the same allegations  and for the company to adopt certain governance measures 
in addition  the settlement provides for the payment of approximately million in attorney s fees to counsel for the plaintiffs  with sciclone s insurers paying for substantially all such fees 
the united states securities and exchange commission sec and the united states department of justice doj are each conducting formal investigations of sciclone regarding a range of matters including the possibility of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec and doj in the conduct of their investigations 
in response to these matters  our board appointed a special committee of independent directors the special committee to oversee our response to the government inquiry 
the special committee has substantially concluded its investigation and on may and  reported its findings and recommendations to the board of directors 
as part of its continuing cooperation with the ongoing investigation of the sec and the doj  the special committee has also reported findings to the sec and doj 
the sec s and doj s formal investigations are continuing 
these continuing investigations could result in administrative orders against us  the imposition of significant penalties and or fines against us  and or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against us or certain of our officers  directors and or employees 
we

we believe our cash and investments as of december  and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and we may report quarterly losses in the future 
results of operations revenues the following table summarizes the year over year changes in our product sales and promotion services revenues in thousands years ended december  change change product sales promotion services total net revenues product sales were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases of million  or  for the year ended december  compared to  and million  or  for the year ended december  compared to were primarily attributable to increased sales of zadaxin 
the increase in the period was also related to the addition of novamed product sales as a result of the acquisition of novamed 
zadaxin sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december and our overall zadaxin revenue growth was attributable to an increase in the quantity of zadaxin sold primarily due to further market penetration in china 
promotion services revenue of million for the year ended december  reflects the addition of novamed promotion services as a result of the acquisition of novamed and was related to the distribution of products under promotional contracts 
total revenues attributable to china were million  million and million  or   and of sales for the years ended december    and  respectively

last year  sinopharm group co 
limited acquired a majority interest in our two largest importers  shanghai lingyun pharmaceutical company ltd 
and guangdong south pharmaceutical foreign trade company ltd 
we do not believe these acquisitions will impact our sales 
our experience with our largest importers or distributors has been good and we anticipate that we will continue to sell a majority of our product to them 
cost of product sales the following table summarizes the year over year changes in our cost of product sales in thousands years ended december  change change cost of product sales 
table of contents cost of product sales were million  for the year ended december   compared to million and million for years ended december  and  respectively

zadaxin cost of sales were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin for zadaxin was for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin for zadaxin for the year ended december   compared to the years ended december  and was due primarily to lower per vial production costs mainly as a result of manufacturing volume efficiencies 
we expect total revenues and cost of product sales to increase in compared to due to increased unit sales of zadaxin related to further market penetration in china  partially offset by potential price reductions of zadaxin  and as a result of the addition of revenues from novamed s product portfolio 
through december   we have been able to maintain our zadaxin gross margin in part due to relatively stable or even decreasing costs of sales  and in part due to maintaining a relatively stable sales price 
zadaxin s list price in china is currently under review by regulatory authorities 
we anticipate that a price reduction may occur  and if a substantial reduction in the list price occurred  our revenues and our gross margins for zadaxin would be substantially reduced 
we expect our zadaxin cost of product sales and gross margins to fluctuate from period to period depending upon the level of sales and price of our products  the absorption of product related fixed costs  currency exchange fluctuations  any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product inventory  and the timing of other inventory period costs such as manufacturing process improvements for the goal of future cost reductions 
sales and marketing the following tables summarize the year over year changes in our sales and marketing expenses in thousands years ended december  change change sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
increases of million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   were attributable to novamed operations as a result of the acquisition of novamed and its sales force of over individuals 
the remaining increases of million for the year ended december   related to increased growth in the zadaxin sales force in china of approximately additional sales individuals  and further market penetration in china resulting in increased sales and marketing costs for compensation and benefits  sales incentives  travel  medical training  and business taxes 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses of million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily related to increased conferences and local training seminars and an increase in employee related costs associated with growth in our sales force and our sales efforts for zadaxin in the period 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  to be higher than those incurred for the year ended december  due to increased sales efforts of zadaxin  depakine and aggrastat  primarily in china 

table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended december   we recognized million in amortization of acquired intangible assets expense  reflecting the amortization of promotion and distribution contract intangible assets acquired as part of the novamed acquisition 
there was no similar expense for the years ended december  or we expect million per year of annual amortization expenses in future years 
research and development r d the following tables summarize the year over year changes in our r d expenses in thousands years ended december  change change research and development research and development r d expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
r d expenses decreased million or for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   r d expenses primarily related to our scv phase b clinical trial which began enrollment in january for the treatment of om and to a lesser extent to the addition of novamed r d expenses due to our acquisition of novamed 
for the year ended december   r d expenses primarily related to our phase a clinical trial of scv for the delay to onset of severe om  the initiation of our scv phase b clinical trial for the treatment of om  and our scv phase b clinical trial for the treatment of hcv 
the decrease of million  or  in r d expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily related to the timing of clinical trial related expenses  including the completion of enrollment of patients in our phase a clinical trial of scv for the delay to onset of severe om in the first quarter of and the discontinuation of the rp clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in these decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to our scv phase b clinical trials for the treatment of hcv and om in the period 
the major components of r d expenses include salaries and other personnel related expenses  including associated stock based compensation  facility related expenses  depreciation of facilities and equipment  license related fees  services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers 
the initiation  continuation  and completion of our current clinical development programs had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses 
as of march   we announced the discontinuation of our scv phase b clinical trial for the delay to onset of severe om based on the results of the pre planned interim analysis that indicated that the trial would not meet the pre specified efficacy endpoints 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly in  compared to  as a result of the discontinuation of the scv phase b clinical trial  and further curtailment of our us based development expenses 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to in license the marketing rights to proprietary products primarily in china  which may result in increased research and development expenses due to license fee payments or other expenses related to in licensing and development of new products in the future 
general and administrative the following tables summarize the year over year changes in our general and administrative expenses in thousands years ended december  change change general and administrative 
table of contents general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of novamed in april  including the general and administrative expenses attributable to novamed operations  acquisition related transaction costs including legal  banker fees  accounting and advisory services of million  and higher professional services primarily related to our fcpa compliance efforts and various tax planning and compliance matters 
during the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million or compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher corporate and legal expenses in connection with responding to the sec and doj investigations announced in august  shareholder litigations that have been filed following the announcement of those investigations  and the conduct of an independent investigation by a special committee of our board of directors in order to evaluate whether any violation of the fcpa or other laws occurred  as well as our business development efforts for china 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will decrease in compared to as a result of lower professional expenses including legal  tax and accounting related 
we do not expect to incur any significant acquisition related costs in  though we continue to evaluate opportunities in china  which may result in increased general and administrative expenses in the future 
contingent consideration as part of the acquisition of novamed  we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earn out payments upon the successful achievement of revenue and earnings targets for the and fiscal years the earn out or contingent consideration 
we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration using the monte carlo simulation model 
we initially recorded million as the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is re measured each period  and changes to the fair value are recorded to contingent consideration expense 
as of december   we estimate the payment of the contingent consideration will be million  resulting in a gain of million from the re measurement of the contingent consideration 
our fair value estimates are based on a variety of factors that may significantly fluctuate from period to period  including the likelihood that earn out targets will be achieved and present value factors associated with the timing of the earn out targets  and may result in significant fluctuations to contingent consideration expense in the future 
interest income interest income was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income has decreased primarily as a result of lower returns due to a declining interest rate environment in and  as compared to interest expense interest expense was million for each of the years ended december    and  and included expenses related to loan origination fees and interest expense associated with our silicon valley bank line of credit 
we expect that interest expense for the year ending december  will remain at a comparable level to those incurred for the year ended december  other income in november  we were awarded approximately million in non taxable grants as part of the us department of treasury s therapeutic discovery project program related to our research and development 
table of contents activities in scv and zadaxin 
there were no similar grants awarded to us during the years ended december  or  and we do not expect any income related to non taxable grants for the year ending december  provision for income tax the provision for income tax of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  relates to our foreign operations in china 
tax expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decreases related to tax benefits recognized of million for the year ended december  on deferred tax assets and liabilities mainly as a result of our acquisition of novamed in april and lower tax expense recorded for the year ended december  related to an uncertain tax position in china  offset partially by an increase in tax expense due to growth in our china operations and an increase in the statutory tax rate of certain of our operations in china from in to in tax expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase in operating activities in china and an increase in the statutory tax rate in china 
in addition  for the year ended december  we recorded an additional tax expense of million related to our uncertain tax position in china 
the statutory tax rate in china was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our statutory tax rate in china is in we expect the provision for income tax to decrease for the year ending december   compared to the year ended december   as we expect a decrease in tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions in china in we have not recorded any us federal or state income tax expense for the years ended december    and undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly  no deferred us income taxes have been provided thereon 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through at december   we had federal research and development  orphan drug and investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources we continue to closely manage our liquidity and capital resources 
we rely on our operating cash flows  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and our short term borrowing arrangement to provide for our liquidity requirements 
we continue to believe that we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next months to fund our working capital requirements of our operations  including our research and development activities  investments in our business  share repurchases  to pay down our short term borrowing arrangements  and to fund our business development activities 

table of contents the following tables summarize our cash and investments and our cash flow activities as of the end of  and for each of  the years presented in thousands as of december  cash and investments as of december   we had million in cash and investments of which million was located in subsidiaries of the company outside the us 
cash held by subsidiaries outside the us is held primarily in us dollars 
such cash is used to fund the operating activities of our foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations which may include in licensing new products  particularly for china  and for potential acquisitions 
generally  we consider such cash to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund us operations 
because of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate that repatriation of cash held by foreign subsidiaries would result in payment of taxes in the us 
years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for year ended december  and primarily reflected the net income for the period  adjusted for non cash items such as stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization expense and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
such changes included an increase in accounts receivable of million related to increases in sales volume and normal fluctuations in the timing of customer receipts 
the majority of our sales are to importers and distributors in china where our accounts receivable collections have standard credit terms generally ranging from to days 
changes also included an increase in inventory levels of million related to higher inventory stock levels to support increased demand for zadaxin product  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million primarily as a result of our acquisition of novamed 
for the year ended december   such changes included an increase in accounts receivable of million  compared to the year ended december   related to increased sales and fluctuations in the timing of cash receipts from customers 
in addition  inventory levels decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily related to an increase in sales and a decrease in production during fiscal  and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities increased million mainly related to an increase in legal and other costs associated with the sec and doj investigations  shareholder litigations that had been filed following the announcement of those investigations  and the conduct of an independent investigation by a special committee of our board of directors  and an increase in accrued taxes and tax reserves 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

table of contents common stock made under our stock award plans 
during the year ended december   we also used million to repurchase approximately  shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  and during the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from borrowing on our line of credit 
the following summarizes our future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years short term debt obligation operating leases purchase obligations contingent consideration unrecognized tax benefits total our short term debt obligations include our expected principal and interest and unused line fee obligations related to our silicon valley bank line of credit 
our calculations of expected principal and interest payments incorporate only current period assumptions for interest rates and borrowings 
these are future minimum rental commitments for office space and copiers leased under non cancelable operating lease arrangements 
these consist of purchase obligations with manufacturers and distributors 
as part of the acquisition of novamed  we may be required to pay up to million in contingent consideration upon the successful achievement of revenue and earnings targets for the and fiscal years 
the timing of the contingent consideration payment  if any  is dependent upon several factors  including whether there is a change in control 
the contingent consideration is expected to be paid no later than the first half of as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which our obligations for unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease over time  the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
we have a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb the credit facility for a financing facility up to million which expires on october  the credit facility bears interest on borrowed funds at the bank s prime rate plus at december  on outstanding balances and is secured by a first priority secured interest in all of our assets  including intellectual property in an event of default 
we are required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum liquidity  as defined  and are subject to certain minimum fees and interest payments 
we are also required to meet certain operating covenants that limit our ability to incur liabilities  create liens  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or distributions  make investments  and dispose of assets 
as of december   we had borrowed million on the credit facility and we were required to maintain a debt coverage ratio of to equal to million of cash in svb cash accounts to meet our financial liquidity covenant and were in compliance with all significant terms of the credit facility 
upon termination of the credit facility  all amounts borrowed must be repaid in full 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under which we may offer and sell up to million of our securities  assuming we continue to meet the sec s eligibility requirements for primary offerings on form s our ability to issue securities under that registration statement will expire in may  and we filed an additional shelf registration with the sec on march  which  if and when declared effective by the sec  would enable us to offer and sell up to million of our securities 
on april   we issued  shares of common stock to former stockholders of novamed as part of our acquisition of novamed 
no more than of such shares may be sold by the holders in any three month period up to october  
table of contents in october  we announced that our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock over a twenty four month period 
we repurchased and retired approximately  shares at a cost of million during the year ended december  we made no share repurchases during the years ended december  or as of december   million of the million share repurchase program authorized by our board was available for future share repurchase 
we consider several factors in determining when to make share repurchases including  among other things  our cash needs  the availability of funding and the market price our stock 
we expect that cash provided by future operating activities  as well as available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program 
we believe that our existing cash and investments and ongoing revenue generating business operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for at least the next months 
we have no current commitments to offer and sell any securities that may be offered or sold pursuant to our registration statement 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we would be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies  product candidates or marketing territories 
additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed either at all or  on favorable terms 
we intend to continue to explore alternatives for financing to provide additional flexibility in managing our operations  in licensing new products  particularly for china  and potential acquisitions 
the unavailability or the inopportune timing of any financing could prevent or delay our long term product development and commercialization programs  either of which could hurt our business 
we cannot assure you that funds from financings  if any  will be sufficient to conduct and complete further clinical trials or to in license additional products 
the need  timing and amount of any such financing would depend upon numerous factors  including the status of the pending regulatory investigations and pending litigations  the level and price of sales of our products  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to our products  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative parties  the status of competitive products  and various alternatives for financing 
we have not determined the timing or structure of any transaction 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in   or critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenue 
we earn product revenue from selling manufactured zadaxin product at the time of delivery 
sales of zadaxin to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them 
we also earn product revenue from purchasing medical products from pharmaceutical companies and selling them directly to importers or distributors 
sales are recognized when the medical products have been delivered to the importers or distributors 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
promotion services revenue 
we recognize promotion services revenue after designated medical products are delivered to the distributors as specified in the promotional contract  which marks the period when marketing and promotional services have been rendered  and when all of the above revenue recognition criteria are met 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and net of an allowance for product returns established at the time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments  when appropriate 
we record our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of various factors 
when estimating the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider historical payment patterns of our customers  the circumstances of each individual customer and their geographic region including a review of the local economic environment  the age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality of our customers  and other factors that may affect customers ability to pay 
at december   no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary 
allowance for product returns 
we maintain an allowance for product returns based on estimates of the amount of product to be returned by our customers which may result from expired product or for price reductions on the related sales and is based on historical patterns  analysis of market demand and or a percentage of sales based on industry trends  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
importing agents or distributors do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  we are expected to replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
the calculation of the product returns allowance requires estimates and involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment 
as a result of the uncertainties involved in estimating the product returns allowance  there is a possibility that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
as of december   we have estimated a product returns allowance of million on our consolidated balance sheet  related to our oncology products and aggrastat product sales 
we evaluate our returns allowance quarterly and adjust it when events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could materially affect our results of operations or financial position  however  to date they have not been material 
it is possible that we may need to adjust our estimates in future periods 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis and include amounts related to materials  labor and overhead 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels and demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  
table of contents inventory write downs may be required which could negatively impact our gross margins and results of operations 
if obsolete items or excess are observed and there are no alternate uses for the inventory  we will record a write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized 
business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of novamed in april in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
asc topic establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
the consideration paid to acquire novamed is required to be measured at fair value and included contingent consideration  which are earn out payments that will be paid upon the successful achievement of revenue and earnings targets for the and fiscal years 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration and sciclone common stock  plus the cash consideration  we assigned the purchase price of novamed to the fair value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to promotion and distribution contract rights and goodwill 
the determination and recognition of the consideration transferred requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration and intangible assets acquired 
as part of the acquisition of novamed  we may be required to pay up to million in contingent consideration upon the successful achievement of revenue and earnings targets for the and fiscal years 
as of december   we have estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration to be million 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when quoted prices and observable inputs are unavailable  fair values are based on internally developed cash flow models and are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration using a monte carlo simulation model and classified it in level of the valuation hierarchy 
the inputs used in the monte carlo simulation model reflect assumptions and estimates including for the risk adjusted discount rate and volatility 
our assessment of the inputs used in the fair value measurement requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of the contingent consideration being measured 
the earn out is based upon certain financial performance metrics  including a revenue based formula and an adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  depreciation and taxes based formula 
the earn out provisions are subject to a number of adjustments and acceleration provisions 
the total earn out payments described above may be increased by million but not exceeding a total maximum contingent cash consideration of million or reduced by million  depending upon whether we are able to achieve targets relating to product distribution agreements 
if there is a change in control of the company on or before april   then the earn out payment would be deemed to be million 
if there is a change in control of the company on or after april  and before december   then the earn out payment would range between million and million depending upon achievement against the adjusted ebitda and revenue targets through the date of the change in control 
in addition  if either i mark lotter is terminated without cause prior to december   or ii if we fail to meet certain obligations to appoint and retain mark lotter and peter barrett or their replacements on our board of directors through december   the earn out payment would be deemed to be million 
we are required to remeasure the contingent consideration each reporting period until the amount of the payment is finalized  which may not occur until december  the change in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized as an adjustment to operating expenses 
from the acquisition date of april  to december   the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration decreased by million primarily as a result of adjustments to certain performance metric projections used to estimate the fair value 
future changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration may be significant  as the ultimate contingent consideration payout could range from to million 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  and asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asc topic requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies the criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
as of december   we have recognized from the acquisition million of intangible assets related to promotion and distribution relationships and million of goodwill 
our intangible assets are amortized over years  based on their estimated useful life  and goodwill is determined to have an indefinite life and therefore  is not amortized 
intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred in accordance with asc topic judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators will be based on operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events such as the loss of promotion and distribution contracts could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles and other long lived assets are impaired resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
contingent liabilities we record as liabilities estimated amounts for litigation  claims or other legal actions that are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves is dependent on the possible outcome of settlement negotiations  regulatory or judicial review and the development of facts and circumstances in extended litigation which could change claims or assessments when both the amount and range of loss on some outstanding litigation is uncertain 
we disclose in the footnotes of the financial statements when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of a material liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes 
as events occur  we will assess the potential liability related to any pending litigation  claims or other legal actions and adjust our estimates accordingly 
such adjustments could materially impact our financial statements 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options  restricted stock units rsus and employee stock purchase plans 
stock based compensation expense for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation expense for rsus is estimated at the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company s common stock on the grant date 
stock based compensation expense values are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the stock based compensation costs that are ultimately expected to vest are recognized as expense ratably as the awards vest over the requisite service period  which is generally one or four years for stock options and rsus and three months for the employee stock purchase plan 
the company estimates pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest 
certain target stock price based options were valued using the monte carlo simulation options pricing model and recognized to expense over the service periods for each of the vesting portions of these awards which were six or eight years 
the option pricing models require the use of certain subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and the expected term of the award 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
expected term is derived from historical data on employee exercises and terminations  or the contractual life of the award for target stock price based options 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  valuation assumptions used to value stock based compensation of awards granted in future periods may change 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
the tax years remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject  although subsequent to december   the internal revenue service completed their examination of our and us federal tax returns with no additional tax assessments or proposed adjustments relating to taxable income for any years 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
recent accounting guidance on may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the new guidance changes some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the disclosure requirements have been enhanced  with certain exceptions for us non public companies 
the most significant change will require entities  for their recurring level fair value measurements  to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements 
new disclosures are required about the use of a nonfinancial asset measured or disclosed at fair value if its use differs from its highest and best use 
in addition  entities must report the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value but where fair value is disclosed 
the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application by public entities is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that the adoption of this update will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in june  fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
under either choice  items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be presented on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb issued another update that indefinitely deferred the specific requirement of presenting reclassification adjustments out of comprehensive income in both net income and comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
during the deferral period  the existing requirements for the presentation of reclassification adjustments must continue to be followed 
this guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  as it only requires a change in the format of presentation 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the revised guidance provides an entity the option to make a qualitative 
table of contents evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
under the revised guidance  an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill impairment exists prior to performing analyses comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the guidance will be effective for us beginning january   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of the guidance will significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
the majority of our sales have been in us dollars  although a significant amount of our sales are denominated in renminbi 
our purchases with contract manufacturers are denominated in us dollars and euros and costs of our marketing efforts in china are paid in local currency 
in addition  we have certain cash balances and other assets and liabilities denominated in euros  renminbi and hong kong dollars 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations  and we do not hedge against the risk associated with such fluctuations 
consequently  changes in exchange rates could result in material exchange losses and could unpredictably  materially and adversely affect our operating results and stock price 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign exchange rates would result in an approximate million increase or decrease  respectively  in our financial assets and liabilities denominated in euros  renminbi and hong kong dollars 
this potential change is based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risks 
such losses have not been significant to date 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in money market funds  term deposits  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us treasury  or government agency notes 
all of our investments mature within one year from date of purchase except for our italian state bonds which mature in our investment securities may be subject to interest rate risk and could decrease in value if market interest rates rise 
to minimize this risk  we primarily hold securities that are short term in duration and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact to the total value of our investment portfolio at december
