item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an owner and manager of retirement communities  assisted living facilities  and nursing homes 
we deliver skilled nursing  assisted living and home health services through wholly owned 
table of contents separate operating subsidiaries 
as of december   we operated facilities  comprised of skilled nursing centers  eight assisted living residences and one independent living senior housing facility  totaling approximately  beds units 
our facilities are located in arkansas  alabama  georgia  missouri  north carolina  ohio and oklahoma via vie 
acquisitions we have embarked on a strategy to grow our business through acquisitions and leases of senior care facilities and businesses providing services to those facilities 
during the year we acquired a total of skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility 
in addition  on december   we closed on a transaction to acquire one skilled nursing facility and one assisted living facility  the transfer of which occurred on january  on december   we completed the acquisition of mountain trace  a skilled nursing facility located in sylva  north carolina  for a purchase price of  we obtained control of the facility effective january  on april   we acquired the southland care center  a skilled nursing facility located in dublin  georgia  the autumn breeze healthcare center  a skilled nursing facility located in marietta  georgia  and college park healthcare center  a skilled nursing facility located in college park  georgia 
the total purchase price for all three facilities was  operations of autumn breeze healthcare and southland care center began may  operations of college park care center began june  on august   five skilled nursing facilities located in oklahoma  were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of  by companies controlled by christopher brogdon  the company s vice chairman and chief acquisition officer  and others 
these facilities are known as the living center  kenwood manor  enid senior care  betty ann nursing center and grand lake villa 
even though we do not have any equity interest in these facilities  we determined that it is a variable interest entity as the ownership entity does not have sufficient equity at risk see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we initially consolidated the oklahoma vie s on august   the date of acquisition and initial operations 
on september   we completed the acquisition of homestead manor  river valley center  bentonville manor  heritage park center and the pinnacle home office all located in arkansas  for an aggregate adjusted purchase price of  as a result of this transaction we became the tenant and operator of the red rose facility located in missouri  and in connection with the transaction paid  in lease acquisition costs and  as a security deposit under the lease 
the term of the lease expires on september  operations of the arkansas facilities began september  operations of the missouri facility began december  on november   we acquired the stone county facilities from white river health system  inc consisting of the stone county nursing and rehabilitation facility  a bed skilled nursing  and the stone county residential care facility  a bed skilled nursing facility assisted living facility  both located in mountain view  arkansas  for an aggregate purchase price of  on december   we acquired woodland manor also known as eaglewood care center  a bed skilled nursing facility  and eaglewood village  an bed assisted living facility  both located in springfield  ohio  for an aggregate purchase price of  operations began on january  
table of contents we are currently evaluating acquisition opportunities in addition to those described above and we continue to seek new opportunities to further our growth strategy 
no assurances can be made that any of these opportunities will be determined to be appropriate or that they may be acquired on terms acceptable to us 
segments the company reports its operations in three segments snf  alf  and corporate other 
the company delivers services through wholly owned separate operating subsidiaries 
the snf and alf segments provide services to individuals needing long term care in a nursing home or assisted living setting and management of those facilities 
the corporate other segment engages in the management of facilities and accounting and it services 
we evaluate financial performance and allocate resources primarily based on segment operating income loss 
segment operating results excludes interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
the table below contains our segment information for the years ended december  and amounts in s snf alf corporate other eliminations total year ended december  net revenue cost of services general and administrative facility rent expense depreciation and amortization salary continuation costs operating income loss total assets capital spending year ended december  net revenue cost of services general and administrative facility rent expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss total assets capital spending skilled nursing facilities we focus on two primary indicators in evaluating the financial performance in this segment 
those indicators are facility occupancy and patient mix 
facility occupancy is important as higher occupancy generally leads to higher revenues 
in addition  concentrating on increasing the number of medicare covered admissions the patient mix helps in increasing revenues 
we include commercial insurance covered admissions that are reimbursed at the same level as those covered by medicare in our medicare utilization percentages and analysis 

table of contents for the year ended december   revenue in our skilled nursing segment increased approximately  as a result of acquisitions during the year 
this segment had an income from operations of  as a result of optimization of occupancy and quality mix as well as expense control 
we expect to continue to implement and refine strategies to sustain these goals 
total assets increased  due to acquisitions made during the year

medicare reimburses our skilled nursing facilities under pps for certain inpatient covered services 
under the pps  facilities are paid a predetermined amount per patient  per day  based on the anticipated costs of treating patients 
the amount to be paid is determined by classifying each patient into a rug category that is based upon each patient s acuity level 
on july   cms announced a final rule reducing medicare skilled nursing facility pps payments in fiscal year by billion  or lower than payments for fiscal year cms announced it is recalibrating the case mix indexes cmis for fiscal year to restore overall payments to their intended levels on a prospective basis 
each rug group consists of cmis that reflect a patient s severity of illness and the services that a patient requires in the skilled nursing facility 
in transitioning from the previous classification system to the new rug iv  cms adjusted the cmis for fiscal year based on forecasted utilization under this new classification system to establish parity in overall payments 
the fiscal year recalibration of the cmis will result in a reduction to skilled nursing facility payments of billion  or 
however  this reduction would be partially offset by the fiscal year update to medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities 
the update  a or million increase  reflects a market basket increase  reduced by a multi factor productivity mfp adjustment mandated by the ppac 
the combined mfp adjusted market basket increase and the fiscal year recalibration will yield a net reduction of billion  or 
assisted living facilities for the year ended december   revenue in our alf segment increased approximately  as a result of increased revenue from acquisitions  an annual increase in rates charged to 
table of contents privately paying residents and increasing occupancy 
this segment had income from operations of  and improvement of  over total assets increased  primarily due to building improvements made during the year 
average occupancy three months ended december  twelve months ended december  total residents of our assisted living facilities rely on their personal investments and wealth to pay for their stay 
recent declines in market values of investments could limit their ability to pay for services or shorten the period of time for which they can pay privately for their stay 
the current depressed market for the sale of homes could limit their ability to sell their personal assets further reducing their ability to remain in our facilities 
furthermore  adult children who have recently become unemployed may decide to care for their parent at home so that their parent s income may help offset some of their own financial burdens 
we do not believe this is a trend and we believe facility occupancy will improve 
corporate other we manage three skilled nursing facilities and one independent living campus for third party owners under contracts that either are for a fixed monthly fee or for a percentage of revenue generated by the managed facility 
depending on the type of contract  our revenues increase annually according to inflationary adjustments stipulated in our management agreements or they increase as the facility s revenue increases for the contracts that are based on a percentage of revenue 
this segment includes our corporate overhead expenses  which are made up of salaries of our senior management team members and various other corporate expenses including  but not limited to  corporate office operating expenses  audit fees  legal fees and board activities 
additionally  non cash charges for compensation expense related to warrants  restricted stock and stock options are included in corporate overhead 
we do not allocate these expenses to the divisions or separate them from management and development business for management review purposes 
we also provide accounting and back office services for one contract in georgia 
divestitures as part of our strategy to focus on the growth of skilled nursing facilities  we decided in the fourth quarter of to exit the home health business 
the results of operations for this segment are reported as discontinued operations and were a net loss of  in inclusive of a goodwill impairment charge of  versus a net income in of  at december   the home health business was held for sale 
the company anticipates the sale or termination of the home health business will occur in critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business knowledge and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time 
actual results may vary from our 
table of contents estimates 
these estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change 
we believe that the following represents our critical accounting policies our financial statements reflect consolidation with entities in which we have determined to have a controlling financial interest arrangements with other business enterprises are evaluated  and those in which adcare is determined to have controlling financial interest are consolidated 
asc topic  consolidation addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition of consolidation ownership of a majority voting interest does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
it concludes that  in absences of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the variable interest entity in its financial statements 
we have evaluated and concluded that we have relationships with variable interest entities in which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary required to consolidate the entities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more information on our variable interest entities 
patient care receivables patient care receivables are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
the administrators and managers of our properties evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis  and adjustments are made if necessary 
approximately of our revenue in our nursing facilities is derived from medicare and medicaid qualifying residents 
charges to these payers are evaluated monthly to insure that revenue is recorded properly and that any adjustments necessitated by our contractual arrangement with these payers are recorded in the month incurred 
asset impairment we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets  other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  on an annual basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the estimated depreciable life of the asset may need to be changed such as significant physical changes in the property  significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows or fair values of the property 
the need to recognize impairment is based on estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property 
if recognition of impairment is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property 
for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  we perform an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or earlier if there are indications of potential impairment 
our asset impairment analysis is consistent with the fair value measurements described in asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
we recorded an impairment to goodwill of  in due to our discontinuation of the home health segment 
if our estimates or assumptions with respect to a property change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our assets 

table of contents business combinations we follow asc  business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as well as the goodwill acquired or gain recognized in a bargain purchase 
the guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
during  we expensed approximately  in acquisition costs with an offsetting bargain purchase gain of  for a net amount of  related to the transactions discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
asc requires that we make certain valuations to determine the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation cost for all share based payments granted after january  based on various vesting criteria over the requisite service period 
we calculate the recognized and unrecognized stock based compensation using the black scholes merton option valuation method  which requires us to use certain key assumptions to develop the fair value estimates 
these key assumptions include expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected term 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded share based compensation charges for various employee and non employee services totaling approximately  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense is a non cash expense and such amounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as required by asc  income taxes  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measure them using the enacted tax laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
at december  we maintain a valuation allowance of approximately  to reduce the deferred tax assets by the amount we believe is more likely than not to not be utilized through the turnaround of existing temporary differences  future earnings  or a combination thereof 
in future periods  we will continue to assess the need for and adequacy of the remaining valuation allowance 
we follow the relevant asc guidance when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the guidance provides information and procedures for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in tax returns

receivables our operations could be adversely affected if we experience significant delays in reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and other third party revenue sources 
our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon the relative amounts of current assets principally cash and patient accounts receivable and current liabilities principally accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in that regard  accounts receivable can have a significant impact on our liquidity 
continued efforts by governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the acceleration of costs by monitoring reimbursement rates  by increasing medical review of bills for services  or by negotiating reduced contract rates  as well as any delay by the staff at our facilities in the processing of our invoices  could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents accounts receivable attributable to patient services of continuing operations totaled million at december   compared to million at december   representing approximately days and days revenue in accounts receivable in and  respectively

we continue to evaluate and implement additional processes to strengthen our collection efforts and reduce the incidence of uncollectible accounts 
inflation we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare program 
we also derive revenue from state medicaid and similar reimbursement programs 
payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state s fiscal year for the medicaid programs and in each october for the medicare program 
these adjustments may not continue in the future  and even if received  such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services 
labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services 
those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
to date  we have generally been able to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses 
we may not be successful in offsetting future cost increases
