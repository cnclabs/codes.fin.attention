on february   we completed the disposition of our mining business to bucyrus 
the results of the mining business were consolidated within the former materials processing mining segment 
on december   we sold the assets of our construction trailer business 
the results of this business were formerly consolidated within the awp segment 
in march  we sold the assets of our powertrain pumps business and gears business 
the results of these businesses were formerly consolidated within the construction segment 
on march   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our atlas heavy construction equipment and knuckle boom crane businesses 
the results of these businesses were formerly consolidated within the construction and cranes segments  respectively 
on april   we completed the portion of this transaction related to the operations in germany and completed the portion of this transaction related to the operation in the united kingdom on august  due to the divestiture of these businesses  the reporting of these businesses has been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we assist customers in their rental  leasing and acquisition of our products through tfs 
tfs utilizes its equipment and financial leasing experience to provide a variety of financing solutions to our customers when they purchase our equipment 
non gaap measures in this document  we refer to various gaap us generally accepted accounting principles and non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies 
we present non gaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with additional analytical tools which we believe are useful in evaluating our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying businesses 
we do not  nor do we suggest that investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap measures we use include the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales  gross profit  selling  general administrative sg a costs and operating profit  as well as the net sales  gross profit  sg a costs and operating profit excluding the impact of acquisitions 
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on our financial results  we believe excluding the effect of these changes assists in the assessment of our business results between periods 
we calculate the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes by translating the current period results at the rates that the comparable prior periods were translated to isolate the foreign exchange component of the fluctuation from the operational component 
similarly  the impact of changes in our results from acquisitions that were not included in comparable prior periods is subtracted from the absolute change in results to allow for better comparability of results between periods 
we calculate a non gaap measure of free cash flow as income from operations plus asset impairment  depreciation  amortization  proceeds from the sale of fixed assets  plus or minus cash changes in working capital  customer advances and rental demo equipment and less capital expenditures 
we believe that the measure of free cash flow provides management and investors further information on cash generation or use 
we discuss forward looking information related to expected earnings per share eps excluding restructuring charges and other items 
this adjusted eps is a non gaap measure that provides guidance to investors about our expected eps excluding restructuring or other charges that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing earnings 
working capital is calculated using the consolidated balance sheet amounts for trade receivables net of allowance plus inventories  less trade accounts payable 
we view excessive working capital as an inefficient use of resources  and seek to minimize the level of investment without adversely impacting the ongoing operations of the business 
trailing three month annualized net sales is calculated using the net sales for the most recent quarter multiplied by four 
the ratio calculated by dividing working capital by trailing three months annualized net sales is a non gaap measure that we believe measures our resource use efficiency 
non gaap measures we use also include net operating profit after tax nopat as adjusted  income loss before income taxes as adjusted  income loss from operations as adjusted  benefit from provision for income taxes as adjusted and stockholders equity as adjusted  which are used in the calculation of our after tax return on invested capital roic collectively the non gaap measures  which are discussed in detail below 
overview in  all of our segments had increases in net sales and profitability  but certain product lines and geographies were still challenged 
this past year was a transitional year for us as we made significant investments and improvements  and implemented actions to set us on a course toward improved profitability in and beyond 
we have seen further recovery in many of our end markets as utilization rates improve and the need to replace existing fleets and equipment has escalated  consistent with an overall improving construction environment 
while not all regions have recovered at the same rate  continued growth in emerging economies along with solid performance in north america have helped to offset weakness we have seen in parts of europe 
our sales in grew by over approximately adjusting for the acquisition of demag cranes ag 
our income from operations in improved approximately million over during this past year we increased production rates in many of our facilities with a focus on improving profitability  enhancing our global capacity utilization and leveraging mixed product locations 
our continuing goal is to establish a leaner  more customer responsive organization 
these efforts have allowed us to improve equipment production on many lines while at the same time managing to reduce our manufacturing space by approximately 
we established restructuring programs and committed to aggressively reduce costs in our operations 
the cost and capacity reduction initiatives we took during and have resulted in an improved cost structure of the company as we head into see note l restructuring and other charges in our condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our restructuring activities  including the reasons  timing and costs associated with such actions 
in our awp business we continue to see strong customer demand and a growing backlog made up of a more diverse mix of customers 
rental utilization rates continued to increase in most regions and have been particularly strong in north america 
more than half of our north american net sales for aerials came from smaller  independent rental companies in the fourth quarter of we also expect margins to be meaningfully improved in as pricing actions take hold 
earlier in the year our cranes segment returned to profitability led by a new management team and a leaner organization 
our port equipment business  which began generating significant losses  ended the year with a modest fourth quarter profit and has been building a strong backlog for in our mp segment  we continue to see a transition from static to mobile equipment and with increasing demand from small mines 
while aggregate demand has weakened a bit  construction  recycling and especially mining have sustained mp s sales levels 
our mhps segment has performed as expected since our acquisition of demag cranes ag 
our construction segment continues to be the most challenging operation 
during  we made progress in this business  however  this business went through a substantial transition with tier engine implementation  which required substantial changes or updates depending on the individual product and market 
our roadbuilding business continues to suffer from weak end user demand and us housing related products such as concrete mixer trucks  while improving  remain significantly below expectations 
we believe we have now positioned the segment for profitability in and will be focusing on geographies and product segments where we have the greatest profitability 
in january  we repaid the entire million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due notes 
the sale of our shares of bucyrus international  inc bucyrus common stock during contributed approximately million to overall liquidity 
we believe our liquidity   million at december   is sufficient to meet our business plans 
see liquidity and capital resources for a detailed description of liquidity and working capital levels  including the primary factors affecting such levels 
for  we see continued demand for new equipment  and estimate that we are in the second year of a multiple year recovery 
overall  our focus will be on profit improvement and cash generation as opposed to net sales growth 
during  net sales growth was important  as it provided us more consistent run rates and we were able to solidify  if not improve  our market share 
in general  however  we were unable to offset increases from our suppliers through pricing actions  which is common during the first year of a recovery 
we expect this will be different in during the second half of we acquired of demag cranes ag bringing our ownership total to approximately  a market leader in both port equipment and industrial cranes 
in addition  they have a complementary parts and service business which has demonstrated consistently strong profitability 
we believe there are many opportunities for leveraging different aspects of both terex and demag cranes ag 
a primary focus for us in will be the integration of demag cranes ag 
for awp  our outlook is positive 
we believe the north american rental channel is in a full replacement cycle and in need of new equipment 
operating margin is expected to be in the range for  driven by price realization and productivity enhancements 
in construction  our focus will be on profitable products and markets 
we expect our roadbuilding operations to continue to face challenges in overall segment operating margin is expected to be in the range of 
for cranes  the outlook reflects a slightly weakened demand environment for cranes in europe  offset by anticipated continued growth in markets that are experiencing recovery  such as north america and australia 
additionally  we expect that increasing demand from developing markets  such as latin america and the middle east  will continue 
the combination of price increases implemented for and restructuring activities enacted in are anticipated to enhance overall profitability 
we expect operating margins to be in the range on steady sales 
for mhps  we expect improving sales trends  led by the services and port solutions businesses  specifically in north america  india and the middle east 
with the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement yet to be effected  no integration benefits are included in the outlook 
we anticipate that operating margins will be in the range  including the impact of purchase accounting and corporate allocation adjustments  which are expected to comprise approximately million of expense during in our mp segment  we anticipate continued strong sales performance in australia and south africa  combined with improved pricing overall 
as a result  we expect operating margins of on slightly higher sales 
our current outlook for net sales in is to billion  an increase of from  and approximately excluding the impact of acquisitions 
our expectation for income from operations is a profit of approximately to million 
as a result  we would expect earnings per share for to be approximately to per share for the year based on an average share count of approximately million shares  excluding the impact of restructuring and unusual items 
the estimated average share count includes shares that may be contingently issuable upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes 
our forecast assumes that the european debt crisis does not materially worsen 
we also anticipate an effective tax rate of for interest expense for the year is forecast to be approximately million based on increased expense associated with term loans issued to partially fund the acquisition of demag cranes ag 
we anticipate other expense including amortization of debt issuance cost and noncontrolling interest of to million 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
we expect the ratio of working capital to trailing three months annualized sales to be approximately at the end of roic continues to be the unifying metric that we use to measure our operating performance 
roic and the non gaap measures assist in showing how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
after tax roic is determined by dividing the sum of nopat for each of the previous four quarters by the average of the sum of total terex corporation stockholders equity plus debt as defined below less cash and cash equivalents for the previous five quarters 
nopat for each quarter is calculated by multiplying income loss from continuing and discontinued operations by a figure equal to one minus the effective tax rate of the company 
we believe that earnings from discontinued operations  as well as the net assets that comprise those operations invested capital  should be included in this calculation of the non gaap measures because they capture the financial returns on our capital allocation decisions for the measured periods 
furthermore  we believe that returns on capital deployed in tfs do not represent management of our primary operations and  therefore  tfs finance receivable assets and results from operations have been excluded from the non gaap measures 
additionally  we do not believe that the realized and deferred gains on marketable securities and specifically the shares of bucyrus bucy shares held from the sale of our mining business  reflects our operations and  therefore  such gains have been excluded from the calculation of the non gaap measures 
the effective tax rate is equal to the provision for benefit from income taxes divided by income loss before income taxes for the respective quarter 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters nopat as this represents the most recent month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarters ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis over the same time period as the numerator four quarters of average invested capital 
terex management and the board of directors use roic as one of the primary measures to assess operational performance  including in connection with certain compensation programs 
we use roic as a unifying metric because we believe that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the amount of capital invested in our primary businesses  excluding tfs  as opposed to another metric such as return on stockholders equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
as the tables below show  our roic at december  was 
the amounts described below are reported in millions of us dollars  except for the effective tax rates

the north american market showed strong growth as the large rental companies continued to replace the equipment in their fleets 
the independent rental firms began to increase their purchases  but at a slower rate than anticipated 
utilization rates of customer fleets remained high  a positive sign of the strength of the replacement cycle despite the continuing soft market conditions in construction applications 
internationally  the demand for and acceptance of aerial work platforms continued to expand steadily  also contributing to the increased sales versus the prior year period 
additionally  benefits were beginning to be captured from price increases that were implemented late in the first half of in all geographies 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in increased net sales  favorable product mix and higher production levels  partially offset by higher material costs  contributed approximately million to the improvement in gross profit

interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million lower than the prior year 
this decrease was primarily driven by reduced interest expense due to the retirement of debt over the past year 
loss on early extinguishment of debt on january   we exercised our early redemption option and repaid the outstanding million principal amount of our notes 
the cash paid to redeem the notes included a call premium of million 
additionally  we recorded non cash charges of million for the write off of unamortized costs  including debt issuance costs  original issue discount and interest rate swap costs  in connection with the repayment of the notes 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that replaced our previous credit agreement 
the termination of our previous credit agreement resulted in non cash charges for accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs of million in the current year period 
other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  an increase of million when compared to expense of million in the prior year 
the change was primarily driven by income in the current year period of approximately million from the sale of approximately million shares of bucyrus common stock 
charges related to the acquisition of demag cranes ag totaling approximately million were partially offset by lower expense of approximately million in the current year period associated with derivative instruments 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income of million  an effective tax rate of  as compared to an income tax benefit of million on a loss of million  an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the higher tax rate recorded in  compared to statutory tax rates  was mainly due to non tax benefitted losses and non tax deductible expenses incurred to acquire demag cranes ag and the enactment of a statutory income tax rate reduction in the uk  which caused a reduction in value in our uk deferred tax assets 
the decrease in the absolute amount of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  caused items of income tax expense and benefit for to have a more significant impact than in when a loss from continuing operations before income tax instead of income from continuing operations before income tax is reported  tax expense items decrease the effective tax rate and tax benefit items increase the effective tax rate 
income loss from discontinued operations we had income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  primarily due to tax related items associated with the results of the mining business prior to divestiture 
in the year ended december   we had losses from discontinued operations primarily due to the results of the atlas business prior to divestiture

sg a costs decreased by million when compared to the same period in sg a costs in awp and construction decreased 
sg a costs in mp were essentially flat and increased in cranes 
prior cost reduction activities lowered general and administrative costs by approximately million 
the decrease was also due to lower restructuring charges of approximately million when compared with the prior year period  as well as million recorded in the prior year period for the settlement of certain sec matters 
the lower sg a costs were partially offset by approximately million from the impact of acquisitions in loss from operations decreased by million for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in the decrease was due to the items noted above  particularly improved net sales volume  improved manufacturing utilization  the effect of prior cost reductions and lower sg a costs 
aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the awp segment for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in while rental customers in the north american and european markets continued to age their aerial fleets and generally deferred the purchase of new products  selective buying patterns began to emerge 
additionally  it appears that the reduction of inventory at rental locations slowed 
developing markets remained a strong growth component for the awp segment as demand for large booms  light towers and telehandlers continued to steadily improve in markets such as south america and australia 
we also sold a portion of the segment s utility rental fleet 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in the favorable impact of higher manufacturing utilization and prior manufacturing cost reduction actions improved results by approximately million 
lower restructuring costs and inventory write downs favorably affected gross profit by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million due to the negative impact from the mix of products sold 
net transactional foreign currency losses negatively impacted results by approximately million compared to the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in cost control efforts  including prior period restructuring actions  lowered sg a spending by approximately million as compared to the prior year period 
additionally  the allocation of corporate expenses was lower by approximately million in compared to the prior year 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  improved million when compared to the same period in the improvement was due to the items noted above  particularly higher net sales  higher manufacturing utilization  prior manufacturing cost reductions and lower sg a costs 
construction of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the construction segment increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the improvement in net sales was driven by a broad based recovery from trough levels in in most product categories and across most regions 
material handlers sales increased significantly and the off highway truck business experienced an increase in order and quotation activities  aided by strong demand from latin american markets 
the compact construction equipment business experienced good order demand  including increased demand for the compact track loader product in north america and undercarriage components supplied to another major manufacturer

additionally  approximately million of lower restructuring and inventory charges in contributed to the increase in gross profit 
other cost of sales including warranty  transactional foreign currency and product liability expenses were lower by approximately million in the current period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in cost control efforts  including prior period restructuring actions  lowered sg a spending by approximately million as compared to the prior year period 
additionally  the allocation of corporate expenses was lower by approximately million in lower restructuring charges of approximately million when compared to the prior year period also contributed to the decrease in sg a costs 
loss from operations for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the same period in the decrease was due to the items noted above  particularly improved net sales  better manufacturing utilization and lower sg a costs 
cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the cranes segment for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in demand for lower capacity crane products  including the lower end of the all terrain product category  continued to weaken in as compared to the prior year period  as commercial construction demand remained soft 
the cranes segment also experienced weakening demand for our crawler crane products in tower crane and rough terrain crane demand remained stable  albeit at low levels 
this lower demand more than offset the increased net sales due to acquisitions 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in lower net sales  partially offset by the mix of larger cranes in the production schedule and the impact of reduced materials cost  negatively impacted profitability by approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
manufacturing utilization improved gross profit when compared to the prior year period by approximately million 
the full year impact of acquisitions in also contributed approximately million to gross profit 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million versus the same period in the increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions  offset in part by a decrease in the allocation of corporate costs from the prior year period and improvement from prior cost reduction activities 
income from operations for the year ended december  decreased million versus the same period in  resulting primarily from lower net sales volume and approximately million from the impact of acquisitions  partially offset by improved manufacturing utilization 
materials processing of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the mp segment increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in demand for materials processing equipment increased as dealers have generally stopped reducing their inventory and ordered in concert with end market demand 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million when compared to the same period in the increase in net sales  combined with the impact of lower material costs and pricing actions  positively affected profitability by approximately million when compared with the prior year period 
other favorable variances in the period included volume driven improved manufacturing utilization of approximately million compared with the prior year period 
lower foreign currency losses positively impacted results by approximately million compared to the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million over the same period in  primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs associated with trade shows  partially offset by reduced restructuring charges and a decrease in the allocation of corporate costs from the prior year period 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  improved million when compared to  primarily due to the items noted above  particularly higher net sales volume and improved manufacturing utilization 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income loss from operations net sales amounts include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
loss from operations increased primarily from the impact of a lower allocation to the business segments of corporate expenses and higher costs associated with stock based compensation and other benefits  partially offset by lower costs as a result of previous restructuring activities and expense related to the sec settlement in interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
higher debt levels resulting from our capital markets activity executed in june combined with acquisition related debt incurred in july increased interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million when compared to the prior year period 
additionally  accelerated amortization related to the redemption of the notes increased interest expense by approximately million 
interest income increased by approximately million compared to the prior year period  reflecting cash balances in jurisdictions with higher return rates 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recorded a pre tax charge for early extinguishment of debt of million in the year ended december  for expense associated with the accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs in connection with the repayment of all of our outstanding term debt on october  other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was expense of million  an increase of million when compared to income of million in the prior year 
this was primarily due to a loss of approximately million associated with marking to market the derivative contracts intended to partially mitigate the risks associated with shares of common stock of bucyrus acquired in connection with the mining business divestiture 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  as compared to an income tax benefit of million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million  an effective rate of  in the prior year 
the lower effective tax rate recorded in was principally attributable to the recognition of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets  the decision to carry back the us tax net operating loss and changes in the jurisdictional mix of income 
the decrease in loss from continuing operations before income tax for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  causes items of income tax expense and benefit in to have a more significant impact on the effective tax rate than in when a loss from continuing operations before income tax instead of income from continuing operations before income tax is reported  tax expense items decrease the effective tax rate and tax benefit items increase the effective tax rate 
loss income from discontinued operations we had losses from discontinued operations for the year ended december  primarily due to the results of the atlas business prior to divestiture 
in the year ended december   we had income from discontinued operations primarily from the mining business offset  in part  by losses in the atlas business 
gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we recognized a gain  net of tax on the sale of the mining business  partially offset by a loss  net of tax on the sale of the atlas and powertrain businesses 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss  net of tax on the sale of the construction trailer business 
in addition  we incurred a loss  net of tax related to transaction costs incurred with the disposition of the mining business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
cost is determined principally by the average cost method and the first in  first out fifo method approximately and  respectively 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions require us to analyze the aging of and forecasted demand for our inventory  forecast future products sales prices  pricing trends and margins  and to make judgments and estimates regarding obsolete or excess inventory 
future product sales prices  pricing trends and margins are based on the best available information at that time including actual orders received  negotiations with our customers for future orders  including their plans for expenditures  and market trends for similar products 
our judgments and estimates for excess or obsolete inventory are based on analysis of actual and forecasted usage 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
we make adjustments to our inventory reserve based on the identification of specific situations and increase our inventory reserves accordingly 
as further changes in future economic or industry conditions occur  we will revise the estimates that were used to calculate its inventory reserves 
at december   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
if actual conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  we will increase our reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory accordingly 
any increase in our reserves will adversely impact our results of operations 
the establishment of a reserve for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory establishes a new cost basis in the inventory 
such reserves are not reduced until the product is sold 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical accounts receivable collection experience will be indicative of future results 
guarantees as of december   we have issued guarantees to financial institutions related to customer financing of equipment purchases by our customers 
we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks  and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh  part of the cranes segment  sichuan changjiang engineering crane co  ltd  part of the cranes segment  and genie holdings  inc and its affiliates genie  part of the awp segment  of million  million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that our historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note q litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by genie of million and the mhps segment of million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees asc 
we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we could expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurances that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
revenue recognition revenue and related costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which generally occurs upon shipment depending upon the shipping terms negotiated 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectibility is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit if the customer meets certain conditions 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with asc the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by asc pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of asc  we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
we selected october as the date for our required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by our management 
the awp  construction  cranes and mp operating segments plus the material handling business including services and port technology business of mhps  comprise the six reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use an income approach derived from the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units is compared to our market capitalization on the valuation date to assess its reasonableness 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the discounted cash flow model also includes a determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
we adopted fasb accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  asu at the beginning of the fourth quarter of on a prospective basis 
see recent accounting pronouncements below 
asu allows us to first assess  qualitatively  whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if we believe  as a result of our qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
we have the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the two step goodwill impairment test 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the tests performed as of october   and see note j goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of any quantitative fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of any reporting unit calculated 
this hypothetical decrease would still result in excess fair value over carrying value for the reporting units as of october  impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if fair value based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we use data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
we recognized asset impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was recognized as part of restructuring costs 
see note l restructuring and other charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances and our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our product safety team 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
defined benefit plans pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained one qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
the benefits covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation in the qualified plan is frozen and participants are only credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plan based on the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of see note o retirement plans and other benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program  excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
in addition  benefits are reduced by social security primary insurance amounts attributable to company contributions 
participation in the nonqualified plan was frozen effective december   however  eligible participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and the amount of benefits 
we maintain defined benefit plans in germany  france  china  india  switzerland and the united kingdom uk for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in germany  france  india and china are unfunded plans 
during  the plan in the uk was frozen 
for our operations in italy  there are mandatory termination indemnity plans providing a benefit that is payable upon termination of employment in substantially all cases of termination 
we record this obligation based on the mandated requirements 
the measure of the current obligation is not dependent on the employees future service and therefore is measured at current value 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the non us funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and are in real estate investment securities 
these allocations are reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plans 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions  including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plan  for the us plan and for the swiss plan at december  our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and to with a weighted average of for non us plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
typically  a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our non us pension plans were to with a weighted average of at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as a reduction in stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily decreases in the discount rate  resulted in a net increase in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plans estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liabilities and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the us could require recording additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each assumption below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u 
s 
plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of our legal entities 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type ordinary income versus capital gain as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because net operating losses nols and other tax attributes  in certain jurisdictions  expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings will be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for income taxes or tax benefits on the differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of our non us subsidiaries where such differences are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
if earnings of foreign subsidiaries are not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us income taxes  foreign income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes may have to be provided 
we do not record deferred income taxes on the temporary difference between the book and tax basis in domestic subsidiaries where permissible 
at this time  determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the investment in subsidiaries is not practical 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing uncertain tax positions 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to file income tax returns that conform to the requirements of each jurisdiction and to record provisions for tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  in accordance with asc  income taxes 
as our business has grown in geographic scope  size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of applicable tax laws  the results of an audit of some of our tax returns could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc  revenue recognition 
this guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
arrangement consideration shall be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price  except under certain circumstances such as items recorded at fair value and items not contingent upon delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists for a deliverable  then the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
this guidance eliminates use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and it allows for use of an entity s best estimate to determine selling price if vsoe and third party evidence cannot be determined 
it also requires additional disclosures such as nature of the arrangement  certain provisions within the arrangement  significant factors used to determine selling prices and timing of revenue recognition related to the arrangement 
this guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment requires new disclosures including the reasons for and amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of activity for level fair value measurements 
it also clarified guidance related to determining appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and information to be provided for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance with respect to level fair value measurements was effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendments in this update clarify the acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro forma financial information disclosures in topic when comparative financial statements are presented 
the amendments also improve usefulness of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures by requiring description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination s 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date was on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which amended asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance addresses efforts to achieve convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs requirements for measurement of and disclosures about fair value 
the amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on companies applying us gaap 
key provisions of the amendment include a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value  except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity s net exposure to the group  an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets  and a requirement that for recurring level fair value measurements  entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements 
in addition  for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed  entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed 
this guidance was effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  asu 
asu defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
asu and were effective for us on january  since the provisions of asu and are presentation related only  adoption of asu and will not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in september  the fasb issued asu  which allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
an entity has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our fourth quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  asu 
asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities and funds raised in capital markets 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the majority of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is expected to be maintained locally 
such cash could be used in the us  if necessary 
cash repatriated to the us could be subject to incremental local and us taxation 
approximately million of cash related to demag cranes ag can only be used to support their operations until the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement dpla is effectuated  which is expected to occur during currently  there are no trends  demands or uncertainties as a result of the company s cash re investment policy that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on us as a whole or that may be relevant to our financial flexibility 
we believe cash generated from operations together with access to our bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to continue to support our internal operating initiatives  meet our operating and debt service requirements and fund approximately million of tax payments due in the first quarter of see item a risk factors for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement that replaced our previous credit agreement 
the new credit agreement provided us with a million term loan and a million term loan 
the proceeds of the term loans were used  along with other cash  to pay for the shares of demag cranes ag and all related fees and expenses 
the term loans are scheduled to mature on april   subject to earlier maturity on march  if the company s existing senior notes have not been satisfied in full prior to that time 
in addition  our new credit facilities provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million 
the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
the revolving lines of credit are scheduled to mature on april   subject to earlier maturity on march  if the company s existing senior notes have not been satisfied in full prior to that time 
we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  the credit agreement also provides incremental commitments of up to million  which may be extended at the option of the lenders and can be in the form of revolving credit commitments  term loan commitments  or a combination of both  provided that no more than million of the incremental amount may be used for incremental term loan commitments 
demag cranes ag has a bank credit agreement the demag cranes credit agreement which matures on november  to provide liquidity for their operations 
the demag cranes credit agreement provides multicurrency revolving lines of credit of million  which can be used for loans or letters of credit to a sub limit of million 
in addition to customary covenants  the demag cranes credit agreement contains certain restrictions on transactions with terex including making loans to or entering into cash pooling arrangements and payment of dividends 
as of december   there was million outstanding under this facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
demag cranes ag had letters of credit issued under this facility of million 
undrawn availability under the demag cranes credit agreement was million 
in january  we entered into the dpla with demag cranes ag that will become effective following the necessary shareholder approval and subsequent registration of the dpla in the commercial register of demag cranes ag 
upon effectiveness of the dpla and upon demand from outside shareholders of demag cranes ag  we will acquire their shares in return for per share 
any outside shareholders of demag cranes ag that choose not to sell their shares to us will receive an annual guaranteed dividend in the gross amount of per share net per share 
the dpla is expected to become effective in upon effectiveness of the dpla  the lenders under the demag cranes credit agreement have the option to terminate the demag cranes credit agreement 
during  we sold our million shares of bucyrus international  inc bucyrus stock for million 
we used the net proceeds from these sales to reinvest in our business including partially funding our purchase of shares of demag cranes ag  which satisfied our obligations to reinvest the net cash proceeds under various agreements governing our debt 
in january  we exercised our early redemption option and repaid the outstanding million principal amount of our notes 
the total cash paid to redeem the notes was million which included a call premium of as set forth in the indenture for the notes  totaling million plus accrued and unpaid interest of per  principal amount at the redemption date 
we increased our investment in financial services assets from approximately million  net at december   to approximately million  net at december  however  our investment in financial services assets decreased from approximately million at september  we remain focused on expanding tfs in key markets like the us  europe and china  however  in  we expect to rely to a greater extent on third party funders 
during  our cash used in inventory was approximately million as we made investments in businesses showing improved order and inquiry activity 
we are continuing our program to increase inventory turns by sharing  throughout our company  many of the best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support our business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
during the last two years  our inventory turns have improved as the company s sales volumes increased 
we generated approximately million in free cash flow in the fourth quarter  which was less than our expectations 
we will continue to pursue cash generation opportunities  including increasing prices for our products  reducing costs and working capital  reviewing alternatives for under utilized assets  and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth in the following table reconciles income from operations to free cash flow in millions three months ended income from operations asset impairment plus depreciation and amortization plus proceeds from sale of fixed assets plus minus cash changes in working capital plus minus customer advances plus minus rental demo equipment less capital expenditures free cash flow our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or used equipment values may affect the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
there can be no assurance that third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers as they have in the past 
as our sales levels change  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may change 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may influence suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition and the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  our customers have delayed purchasing decisions  which has had a negative impact on cash generated from operations 
for certain products  primarily port equipment  we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these products 
to help fund our cash expenditures  we have maintained cash balances and a revolving line of credit from our bank group as described above 
although we believe that the banks participating in our credit facilities have adequate capital and resources  we can provide no assurance that each of these banks will continue to operate as a going concern in the future 
if any banks in our lending group were to fail  it is possible that borrowing capacity under our credit facilities would be reduced 
if our cash balances and availability under our credit facilities were reduced significantly  we might need to obtain capital from alternate sources in order to finance our capital needs  but there can be no assurance that such financing would be available at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
typically  we have invested our cash in a combination of highly rated  liquid money market funds and in short term bank deposits with large  highly rated banks 
our investment objective is to preserve capital and liquidity while earning a market rate of interest 
in and  we used a portion of our cash balance to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by our suppliers where the returns were greater than the amount that would have been earned on such cash if invested in money market funds and short term bank deposits 
we expect this practice to continue in  although we may discontinue it at any time 
interest rates charged under our bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and million in us dollar and euro denominated term loans outstanding at december  the us dollar term loans bear interest at a rate of london interbank offer rate libor plus  with a floor of on libor 
the euro term loans bear interest at a rate of euro interbank offer rate euribor plus with a floor of on euribor 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on these term loans was 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix while reducing interest rate risk 
the revolving line of credit under our credit facility expires in april our convertible senior subordinated notes mature in june  our senior notes mature in june and our senior subordinated notes notes mature in november see note m long term obligations  in our consolidated financial statements 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facilities  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
as a result of our settlement with the sec and final court decree in august  for a period of three years  or such earlier time as we are able to obtain a waiver from the sec  i we are no longer qualified as a well known seasoned issuer wksi as defined in rule of the securities act of  and cannot take advantage of the benefits available to a wksi  which include expedited registration and access to the capital markets  ii we cannot rely on the safe harbor provisions regarding forward looking statements provided by the regulations issued under the securities exchange act of  and iii we cannot utilize regulation a or d 
however  we have an effective billion multi security shelf registration statement on file with the sec that allows for easier access to the capital markets 
cash flows cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the change in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by improved operating income  less cash used for working capital and tax refunds received in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of demag cranes ag partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of bucyrus international common stock in combined with the proceeds from the sale of the mining business in february cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of million 
the change was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in connection with a new credit facility offset in part by the repayment of long term debt  both occurring in the year ended december   compared to repayment of long term debt in the year ended december  contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include non cancellable and cancellable commitments 
in many cases  cancellable commitments contain penalty provisions for cancellation 
long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
with respect to our tax audits worldwide  it is reasonably possible that we will make payments in of up to million 
payments may be made in part to mitigate the accrual of interest in connection with income tax audit assessments that may be issued and that we would contest  or may in part be made to settle the matter with the tax authorities 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the retirement plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions and payments to the retirement plans of million  and we estimate that our retirement plan contributions will be approximately million in changes in market conditions  changes in our funding levels or actions by governmental agencies may result in accelerated funding requirements in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is generally limited to our customer s remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of a customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex demag gmbh and sichuan changjiang engineering crane co  ltd  both part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our awp segment  of million  million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future date 
as described in note q litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurance that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies and interest rate risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed and forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over london interbank offer rate libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   when we repaid the outstanding portion of the notes 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  intellectual property claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations  guarantees  class action lawsuits and the matters described above in item legal proceedings 
we are insured for product liability  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability  property damage  intellectual property and other insurable risk required by law or contract with retained liability to us or deductibles 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
for contingencies and uncertainties other than income taxes  when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
all of our employees are required to obey all applicable national  local or other health  safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
we are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment  machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards 
each of our facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every three years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
we are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices  training and procedures 
for example  we have significantly reduced lost time injuries in the workplace since and we continue to work toward a world class level of safety practices in our industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments  refer to note k derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar when compared to functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows  identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to partially offset anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the effect that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that a change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december  would have had an approximately million impact on the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes already included in our reported operating income for the period 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate  libor and euribor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was approximately 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
the floating rate is based on a spread of over libor 
at december   the floating rate was 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   which was the effective date that the hedged debt was extinguished 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pretax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  commodities risk principal materials and components that we use in our various manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect our financial performance 
input costs continue to be a challenge  particularly in awp where input costs stabilized in the fourth quarter of  but remain higher compared to the prior year and in our truck business in construction where tires have been an issue 
component availability is still impacting us  particularly certain of our construction businesses  although this was less prevalent in the second half of than earlier in the year 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a single source supplier  although alternative suppliers of such materials may be generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated on a regular basis on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and may employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any single source suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
we have designed and implemented plans to mitigate the impact of these risks by using alternate suppliers  expanding our supply base to include asian suppliers  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers 
we continue to search for acceptable alternative supply sources and less expensive supply options on a regular basis  including improving the globalization of our supply base and using suppliers in china and india 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
