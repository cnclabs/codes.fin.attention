overview 
we are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units 
our subsidiary  merit enterprises  is a general contractor that acts as our in house construction division and provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties 
on october   we announced our intention to exit the third party construction services business 
we have since substantially completed performance under all of our remaining third party construction services contracts 
we intend to continue to provide general contracting and construction services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate 
during the year ended december   our two primary sources of cash and revenue from operations were rents from the leasing of owned apartment units  which represented of our consolidated revenue and construction services  which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year 
the operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic trends including  but not limited to  factors such as household formation  job growth  unemployment rates  population growth  immigration  the supply of new multifamily rental communities and in certain markets  the supply of other housing alternatives  such as condominiums  single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes 
additionally  our performance may be affected by the access to  and cost of  debt and equity 
rental revenue collections are impacted by rental rates  occupancy levels and rent concessions 
we adjust our rental rates and concessions in our continuing efforts to adapt to changing market conditions and maximize rental revenue 
we continuously monitor physical occupancy and net collected rent per unit to track our success in maximizing rental revenue 
these indicators are more fully described in the results of operations comparison 
additionally  we consider property noi and ffo to be important indicators of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties and has the largest impact on our financial condition and operating results 
ffo is used by real estate investment trusts as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of real estate companies because it excludes charges such as real estate depreciation that are generally considered not to be reflective of the actual value of real estate assets over time 
additionally  gains and losses from the sale of most real estate assets and certain other items are also excluded from ffo 
see selected financial data presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for reconciliations of property noi and ffo to consolidated net income loss income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our same community portfolio for the years and consists of properties containing  units and accounted for of total revenue in and of our property noi 
our same community portfolio includes properties that we have owned and operated for the entire two year period ending december  same community noi increased in compared to primarily as a result of a million or increase in noi from our midwest ohio  michigan and indiana portfolio 
our mid atlantic maryland  metro dc and virginia portfolio noi increased  or and our southeast georgia and florida portfolio noi increased  or in the following table presents property noi results for and year ended december  in thousands property noi property noi same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties development total property noi our earnings guidance anticipates the acquisition of approximately zero to million of properties and the disposition of approximately million to million of properties 
additionally  our development spend is expected to be approximately million and includes the completion of our nashville development and the commencement of construction on two sites in dallas 
as of december   we have incurred million of costs in connection with the development of vista germantown in nashville  tennessee and anticipate that an additional million of expenditures will be incurred to complete the construction 
we anticipate that construction should be completed during the second quarter of we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions and development opportunities when our investment criteria are met 
we also may sell properties where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide  over time  a significantly greater return on equity  an increase in cash flow or further enhance our strategic objectives 
we will continue to focus on the ratio of our total debt to gross real estate assets which was at december  compared with at december  we will also continue to focus on the reduction of our overall weighted average interest rate on our borrowings  which improved to at december  compared with at december  and our fixed charge coverage ratio which improved to times at december  from times at december  in order to maximize property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
in  at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community noi to increase  driven by a increase in property revenue and a increase in property operating expenses compared to the increase in revenue will primarily be due to maintaining physical occupancy levels and from increased rental rates 
however  the uncertainties caused by economic and financial conditions complicate our ability to forecast future performance 
we believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather a continuing recessionary environment or delayed recovery than other real estate sectors because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays and because government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide attractive apartment financing  which may be unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors 
however  our expectations may be adversely impacted if recessionary forces resume or if congress curtails fannie mae or freddie mac financing support to the apartment industry 
moreover  unless and until real job growth occurs in our markets  significant rental growth may be limited 
federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operations fixed assets acquisitions and development expenditures  net net property disposition proceeds recurring  revenue enhancing and non recurring capital expenditures debt increase decrease in mortgage notes decrease increase in revolving credit facility borrowings increase in term loan borrowings redemption of trust preferred securities exercise of stock options common share issuances preferred share redemption cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid purchase of treasury shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the unsecured revolver  project specific loans and the sale of debt or equity securities 
our debt repayment obligations are relatively modest 
on january   we prepaid two loans totaling million that included prepayment penalties totaling million 
both of these loans were scheduled to mature in we funded this prepayment from borrowings on our million unsecured revolving credit facility 
as of the filing date  we had five additional loans totaling million maturing in we intend to prepay at par three of the loans totaling million on march   and prepay at par the remaining two loans totaling million on or before july   from borrowings on our unsecured revolver and or other secured or unsecured financings or proceeds of the sale of common shares 
in january  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that among other things increased the maximum amount of borrowings under the revolver to million  extended the maturity date to january  and provided for a one year extension option 
additionally  the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an increase of the total facility to million upon request and agreement of the lenders participating in the facility 
our borrowing capacity under the revolver is a function of our unencumbered property pool 
as of february   the maximum amount of borrowings available to us under the revolver was million and borrowings outstanding totaled million 
on june   we closed on a million unsecured  five year term loan 
this loan currently has a variable interest rate  which was at december   and matures june  proceeds from the term loan were used to pay down borrowings outstanding on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes 
on december   we entered into a forward starting swap effective june   which fixes the rate on the term loan until maturity at a rate of plus the credit spread which is currently  or an all in rate of based upon the credit spread applicable under the term loan as of february  which is subject to change dependent upon our leverage ratio 
our ability to access the capital markets affords us additional liquidity as demonstrated by our sale of  of our common shares in in three separate underwritten offers to the public markets 
the net proceeds from these offerings  which totaled approximately million  were used to repay maturing debt  redeem all of our outstanding class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares  redeem all of our trust preferred securities  partially pay for three newly acquired operating properties  acquire the land for our germantown nashville  tennessee development  to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolver  and for general corporate purposes 
additionally  during  we sold  common shares under our continuous at the market atm offering program  which generated proceeds of million net of sales commissions and other costs 
the proceeds were used to reduce borrowings on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes 
cash flow provided by operations increased million when comparing to the increase was primarily due to an increase in property noi as a result of the addition during of four properties  the completion of a unit expansion at one of our existing properties and the acquisition  during  of three additional properties 
cash flow provided by operations increased slightly when comparing to the increase was primarily due to the increase in construction receivables net of the increase in construction payables and the increase in share based compensation 
the increase in construction activity was due to our subsidiary  merit enterprises  commencing several third party construction projects during merit records its revenues and related expenses based on the percentage of completion method and  as such  records receivables and payables as part of the estimate of the amounts completed 
shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement that relates to possible offerings  from time to time  of debt securities including convertible debt  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
this registration statement was for million and expires in june securities and or debt offerings up to million are currently available under this shelf registration statement 
additionally  effective august   we registered an atm program  where we can sell up to million of our common shares in open market transactions at the then market price per share 
during  we sold  common shares under this program for total gross proceeds of million or million net of sales commissions and other costs  leaving million available under this program 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources such as the unsecured revolver  secured and unsecured borrowings are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for repayment of debt  any property acquisitions and funding other capital expenditures are expected to be provided primarily by proceeds from the refinancing of debt borrowings  our unsecured revolver  the sale of properties and possibly the sale of common shares 
we anticipate financing the estimated million balance of the construction costs for our unit germantown nashville  tennessee development through borrowings remaining available under the construction loan we have arranged for that project 
additionally  we anticipate that the development of the unit expansion of san raphael apartments will be financed from our unsecured revolver 
also  we anticipate that the development of our planned dwell turtle creek apartment community in dallas will be financed by a construction loan and funding from our unsecured revolver

results of operations in the following discussion of the comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and the year ended december  to the year ended december   same community properties represent wholly owned properties that were owned during all of  and acquired development properties represent three properties acquired in  four properties acquired in and a unit expansion of a virginia property  which was completed in june the net loss from continuing operations increased  during compared to primarily as a result of an increase in total revenues of million net of an increase of million in expenses and million in interest expense 
the net loss from continuing operations decreased million during compared to primarily as a result of an increase in total revenues of million net of an increase of in total expenses during the following chart reflects the amount and percentage change in line items that are relevant to the changes in overall operating performance increase decrease when comparing the years ended december  in thousands to to property revenue fees  reimbursements and other construction and other services revenue property operating and maintenance expenses depreciation and amortization direct property management and service company expenses constructionand other services expense general and administrative expenses interest expense income from discontinued operations property revenue 
property revenue is impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels  ie  net collected rent per unit 
physical occupancy at the end of each period and net collected rent per unit are presented in the following tables physical occupancy for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a development n a physical occupancy represents the actual number of units leased divided by the total number of units available at the end of the period 
reflects construction of units placed in service june  average monthly net collected rent per unit for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a development n a average monthly net collected rent per unit is calculated as total market rent for all units less vacancy and concessions  divided by the total number of units available 
this does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit 
property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the acquired and development properties 
property revenue for the same community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents potential rent less concessions 
the majority of the improvement was in the midwest portfolio 
property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the acquired and development properties 
property revenue for the same community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents and a decline in the amount of vacancy losses 
the majority of the improvement was in the southeast portfolio 
fees  reimbursements and other 
the management and service company revenues fees  reimbursements and others declined  when comparing to effective during  we terminated our remaining property and asset management contracts and exited the third party management business 
therefore  we will no longer be reporting management fee revenue 
property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses for the acquired and development properties increasing million when comparing the two years 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses of million for the properties acquired or developed in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties 
the intangible assets  consisting primarily of relationships with residents under month leases  are being amortized over a month period 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties 
the intangible assets are being amortized over a to month period 
direct property management and service company expenses 
direct property management and service company expenses decreased in compared to due to our terminating all property and asset management contracts and exiting the third party management business  as referenced above 
construction and other services 
our subsidiary  merit enterprises  is engaged as a general contractor and construction manager that acts as our in house construction division as well as provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties 
during and  merit worked on ten projects for third parties 
in  we decided to exit the third party construction services business and we have substantially completed our work under all third party construction contracts 
we intend to continue to provide general contracting and construction services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate 
revenues for were in line with revenues earned in while expenses increased by approximately million primarily as a result of additional construction costs incurred for certain rehabilitation projects subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts 
the revenue and expenses shown for represent construction services for third parties  while the revenue and expenses shown for were from third party painting services that merit provided at that time but has since ceased providing 
general and administrative expenses 
there were no significant variances when comparing to general and administrative expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase in adjustments to various payroll and incentive compensation accruals  including a one time charge of approximately  related to the resignation of our former vice president and general counsel  net of a decline in directors deferred compensation expense 
prior to january   the fair value of the directors deferred compensation was adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
effective january   this plan was modified to provide that all distributions under the plan will be in the form of our common shares instead of cash 
as a result  the fair value of the deferred compensation is no longer adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million when comparing to the increase was primarily due to the net of the following interest on mortgage loans secured by same community properties declined million due to the prepayment of seven loans in totaling million and five loans in totaling million 
interest expense on mortgage loans secured by acquired properties increased million due to the addition of two loans totaling million in and a million loan in additionally  interest expense in connection with our unsecured revolver and unsecured term loan increased million due to increased borrowings on the unsecured revolver throughout when compared to and the closing of the unsecured term loan in june furthermore  our weighted average interest rate declined to at december  interest expense decreased million when comparing to the decrease was primarily due to mortgage loan interest expense declining million due to a reduction in mortgage loans of million during additionally  on june   we redeemed all of our trust preferred securities  which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million 
in connection with the original issuance of the trust preferred securities  we incurred issuance costs that were recorded as other assets and subsequently charged to interest expense each period over the life of the securities 
we recognized the remaining balance of  of issuance costs as a one time non cash charge to interest expense in furthermore  the average interest rate dropped to at december  from at december  income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  are the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in also included in is a gain on insurance recoveries  which resulted from the settlement of wind storm damage at one of the properties sold in for the aggregate sum of  which is net of our deductible 
included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  are the operating results of the two properties sold in and the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
preferred share repurchase costs 
on june   we redeemed all of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a cost of approximately million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
in connection with the issuance of the class b preferred shares in december  we incurred approximately million in issuance costs and recorded such costs as a reduction to shareholders equity 
we recognized the million of issuance costs as a reduction in net earnings in computing our net loss applicable to common shares for the year ended december  inflation 
we believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impact our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms  which allow us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases 
we are careful to account for inflationary factors that may impact our development projects  however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not result in development costs exceeding original estimates in future periods 
see item a risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  our two taxable reit subsidiaries  the operating partnership structured as a downreit that owns one of our operating properties in florida and the partnership in which we are a partner that owns our development property in nashville  tennessee 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of other companies in similar businesses 
the company has identified five critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the five critical accounting policies are construction services 
we account for general contracting and construction management services that we provide to third parties using the percentage completion method 
under this method  the amount of revenue and expense to be recognized for each project that we are engaged in at the end of each reporting period is estimated based on the percentage of work completed on that date 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining the percentage of work completed  the expected total cost of a project in process  and in certain circumstances the total amount of revenue for a project in process 
if we had used different estimates  different amounts would have been recognized in revenue and expense which may have resulted in a material impact to our results of operations 
if actual costs or revenue differ from estimates  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
because we are exiting the third party construction services business and have substantially completed all third party construction contracts at december   our construction services accounting policy will no longer be a critical accounting policy for and future years 
impairment of long lived assets 
our held for investment real estate assets are assessed for impairment if current events or circumstances  such as significant adverse changes in general market conditions  decreases in property net operating income  or reductions in expected future cash flows  indicate that the carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in evaluating impairment of real estate assets held for investment include estimated future growth rates  capitalization rates  occupancy assumptions  current expectations regarding the holding period for the individual assets  and external data to the extent available 
should the estimates used change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
share based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of restricted share awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models  such as volatility of share prices and forfeitures of awards 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
we also estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
real estate taxes 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in most circumstances  the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and consequently these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
acquisitions of investment properties 
we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including analysis provided by an advisor  independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property  our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 
we amortize intangible assets over months and had we determined different estimates it could have resulted in the recognition of different expense amounts 
contingencies environmental 
we have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations aros and have determined that we do not have any material aros that would require recognition as a liability or disclosure in our financial statements at december  phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of the our initial public offering in  property acquisition and or property refinancing  as applicable  on all of our wholly owned properties 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
pending litigation 
for a discussion of pending litigation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have managed  and will continue to manage  interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a prudent ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions
