item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below for a discussion of the amount of the company s net sales contributed by product categories 
industry overview the distribution channels for specialty technology products generally consist of manufacturers  wholesale distributors such as scansource  resellers and end users 
the sales channel for specialty technology products typically evolves through a three stage process i direct sales by manufacturers to end users  ii single tier distribution in which manufacturers sell to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users  and iii two tier  or wholesale distribution  in which manufacturers sell to wholesale distributors  including scansource  who sell only to resellers who  in turn  sell directly to end users 
currently  the wholesale distribution channel for technology products is served by both broad line and specialty distributors 
the broad line distributors are engaged primarily in conventional order fulfillment and typically offer their reseller customers less support and fewer value added services than do specialty distributors 
the specialty distributors that compete with scansource are generally smaller  both in terms of size and geographic area covered 
competition among an expanding number of manufacturers typically causes product prices to decrease and product applications to expand  which has resulted in an increasing number of resellers entering the market in order to support a broader base of potential end users 
as the number of resellers and end users has grown  competition among manufacturers and within the reseller channel has intensified 
because many specialty technology manufacturers develop products that represent only one part of a total solution  most products eventually are developed to provide interoperability among products from multiple manufacturers 
as a result of interoperability  a variety of manufacturers products are typically configured together to create a system solution 
therefore  both manufacturers and resellers have become more dependent upon value added wholesale distributors such as scansource for the aggregation of products and reseller support services  as well as the organization and maintenance of an efficient market structure 
in addition  manufacturers that face declining product prices and rising costs of direct sales increasingly rely upon value added wholesale distributors by outsourcing certain support functions  such as product assortment  delivery  inventory management  technical assistance and marketing 
at the same time  shortened product life cycles and the introduction of new products and applications have caused resellers increasingly to rely on wholesale distributors for various inventory management  financing  technical support and related functions 
the company believes that as the reseller market grows and becomes more fragmented  and as specialty technology products continue to transition to open systems  the wholesale distribution channel in which the company operates will become increasingly more important

the company s key vendors in its security sales units include alvarion  arecont  axis  bosch  cisco  datacard  exacq technologies  fargo  hid  march networks  panasonic  pelco  ruckus wireless  samsung  sony and zebra card 
the company s products are typically purchased directly from the manufacturer on a non exclusive basis 
the company s agreements with its vendors generally do not restrict the company from selling similar or comparable products manufactured by competitors 
the company has the flexibility to terminate or curtail sales of one product line in favor of another due to technological change  pricing considerations  product availability  customer demand or vendor distribution policies 
the company has approximately hardware and software vendors that currently supply its products 
of all of the company s vendors  only two  motorola and avaya  each constituted more than of the company s net sales 
the company has three non exclusive distribution agreements with motorola 
one agreement covers sales of motorola hardware and software products in north and south america  another agreement covers sales of motorola hardware and software products in europe  the middle east and africa and another agreement covers sales of wireless products in europe 
the motorola agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms  and either party may terminate the agreement upon days and days  respectively  notice to the other party 
the company also has two non exclusive distribution agreements with avaya 
one agreement covers the distribution of avaya products in the united states  and the other agreement covers distribution of avaya products in the united kingdom and certain portions of continental europe 
in addition  the avaya agreements provide separate authorizations for the avaya enterprise communications group ecg and avaya small to medium business smb product lines 
the avaya agreements each have a one year term that automatically renews for additional one year terms if not terminated by either party upon days or days notice  respectively  to the other party 
in addition to the motorola and avaya agreements mentioned above  the company has written distribution agreements with almost all of its vendors 
these agreements are in the form that the company believes are customarily used by manufacturers and distributors 
the company s agreements generally provide it with non exclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries in which the company can distribute its products 
these agreements typically provide the company with stock rotation and price protection provisions  including with motorola and avaya 
stock rotation rights give the company the ability  subject to certain limitations  to return for credit or exchange a portion of those inventory items purchased from the vendor 
price protection situations occur when a vendor credits the company for declines in inventory value resulting from the vendor s price reductions 
along with the company s inventory management policies and practices  these provisions are designed to reduce the company s risk of loss due to slow moving inventory  vendor price reductions  product updates or obsolescence 
some of the company s distribution agreements contain minimum purchase requirements that the company must meet in order to receive preferential prices 
the company participates in various rebate  cash discount and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendor s products 
these rebates and purchase discounts are generally influenced by sales volumes and are subject to change 
the company s distribution agreements are generally short term  subject to periodic renewal  and provide for termination by either party without cause upon to days notice 
the company s vendors generally warrant the products the company distributes and allow returns of defective products  including those returned to the company by its customers 
the company generally does not independently warrant the products it distributes  however  local laws may in some cases impose warranty obligations on the company 
the company s merchandising department recruits vendors and manages important aspects of its vendor relationships  such as purchasing arrangements  cooperative marketing initiatives  vendor sales force relationships  product training  monitoring of rebate programs and various contract terms and conditions

index to financial statements customers the company s reseller customers currently include over  active value added reseller accounts vars located in the united states  canada  latin america and europe 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s total net sales for the fiscal year ended june  the company generally targets two types of reseller customers specialty technology vars and networking or pc vars 
specialty technology vars these resellers focus on selling specialty technology products as tailored software or integrated hardware solutions for their end users existing applications 
they also incorporate specialty technology products into customized technology solutions for their end users 
primary industries served by these resellers include manufacturing  distribution  health care  pharmaceutical  hospitality  government  convenience  grocery  financial and other retail markets 
networking or pc vars these resellers develop computer solutions and networking for their end users microcomputer needs 
they typically have well established relationships with end user management information system directors and are seeking additional revenue and profit opportunities in related technology markets  such as aidc  pos  security or communications 
sales and electronic commerce the company s sales department consists primarily of inside sales representatives located in the united states  canada  mexico  brazil  belgium  france  germany  the united kingdom and the netherlands 
in order to build strong customer relationships  most active resellers are assigned to a sales representative 
each sales representative negotiates pricing directly with their assigned customers 
the company also employs business development representatives who are responsible for developing technical expertise within broad product markets  recruiting customers  creating demand  and reviewing overall product and service requirements of resellers 
each sales representative and business development representative receives comprehensive training with respect to the technical characteristics of each vendor s products 
this training is supplemented by frequent product seminars conducted by vendors representatives and bi weekly meetings among product  marketing and sales managers 
increasingly  customers rely upon the company s electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to its product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
through the company s websites  most customers can gain remote access to the company s information systems to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and place orders 
customers can also follow the status of their orders and obtain united parcel service ups and federal express fedex package tracking numbers from this site 
marketing the company provides a range of marketing services  including cooperative advertising with vendors through trade publications and direct mail  product catalogs for each of the north american  european and latin american markets  periodic newsletters  management of sales leads  trade shows with hardware and software companies and vendors and sales promotions 
in addition  the company organizes and operates its own seminars and teams with top vendors to recruit prospective resellers and introduce new applications for the specialty technology products it distributes 
the company frequently customizes its marketing services for vendors and resellers 
value added services in addition to the basic order fulfillment and credit services that conventional wholesale distributors typically provide to resellers  we differentiate ourselves by providing an array of value added services and business tools that assist resellers to provide more complete solutions and improve customer service 
such services include custom configuration  professional services  technical support  partner marketing  web storefronts  custom packaging  and other specialized services 

table of contents 
index to financial statements operations information system the company s information system is a scalable  centralized processing system capable of supporting numerous operational functions including purchasing  receiving  order processing  shipping  inventory management and accounting 
sales representatives rely on the information system for on line  real time information on product pricing  inventory availability and reservation  and order status 
the company s warehouse operations use bar code technology for receiving and shipping  and automated ups and fedex systems for freight processing and shipment tracking  each of which is integrated with the company s information system 
the customer service and technical support departments employ the system for documentation and faster processing of customer product returns 
to ensure that adequate inventory levels are maintained  the company s buyers depend on the system s purchasing and receiving functions to track inventory on a continual basis 
central warehouse and shipping we operate a  square foot distribution center in southaven  mississippi  which is located near the fedex hub facility in memphis  tennessee and serves all of north america 
our european operation utilizes a third party warehouse located in liege  belgium that services all of europe 
our latin american warehouses are located in florida  mexico and brazil 
our centralized distribution model creates several advantages  including i a reduced amount of safety stock inventory which  in turn  reduces the company s working capital requirements  ii an increased turnover rate through tighter controls over inventory  iii maintenance of a consistent order fill rate  iv improved personnel productivity  v improved delivery time  vi simplified purchasing and tracking  vii decreased demand for management personnel  and viii flexibility to meet customer needs for systems integration 
our objective is to ship all orders on the same day  using bar code technology to expedite shipments and minimize shipping errors 
the company offers reduced freight rates and flexible delivery options to minimize a reseller s need for inventory 
financial services our sales terms are competitive within our specific geographic areas for qualified resellers and facilitate various third party financing options  including leasing  flooring and other secured financing 
we believe this policy reduces the customer s need to establish multiple credit relationships with a large number of manufacturers 
competition the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on factors such as price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors  as well as hardware manufacturers including most of the company s vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  our competitors include master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company has and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units over the last several years as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could also result in price reductions  reduced margins and or loss of market share 
in our worldwide pos and barcoding sales units  the company competes with broad line distributors  such as avnet  ingram micro and synnex in all geographic segments 
additionally  the company also competes against other smaller  more specialized aidc and pos distributors  such as azerty  bluestar  bp solutions  interway do brasil and nimax 
in our worldwide communications sales units  the company competes against other broad line distributors  such as avnet  ingram micro and tech data  and more specialized distributors  such as jenne and westcon 
in our worldwide security sales units  the company competes against other broad line distributors  such as ingram micro and tech data  and more specialized distributors  such as adi  anixter and tri northern 
as the company seeks to expand its business into other areas closely related to the company s offerings  the company may encounter increased competition from current competitors and or from new competitors  some of which may be the company s current customers

risk factors 
the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
these risks should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
there also are other risks that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could impact us 
if any of these risks develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any risk factors  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
global economic instability current world wide economic conditions and market disruptions may adversely affect our business  pricing strategy and results of operations 
financial markets throughout the world could experience extreme disruption  including  among other things  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations and pricing volatility of others  volatile energy costs  geopolitical issues and failure and potential failures of major financial institutions 
these developments and or a related general economic downturn may adversely impact our business and financial condition in a number of ways 
currently  we are experiencing weakened demand in our european operations as a result of current economic conditions in the region 
economic slowdowns can lead to reduced information technology spending by end users  which can adversely affect our sales 
economic instability has increased competitive pressure throughout the channels we serve  resulting in pricing pressures that have decreased our margins 
this effect may continue in the future 
global economic downturn and instability may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions  such as rebates  cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts  which may result in downward pressure on our gross margins 
tightening of credit in financial markets and general economic downturn may adversely affect the ability of our reseller customers  vendors and service providers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
this can result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services  negatively impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable being required and lead to elevated levels of obsolete inventory 
deterioration in financial and credit markets heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in payments 
significant volatility and fluctuations in the rates of exchange for the us dollar against currencies such as the euro  british pound and the brazilian real may also negatively impact our customer pricing and operating results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continue to be unable to predict the duration of the current economic downturn and disruption in financial markets or their effects on our business and results of operations 
international operations our international operations expose us to risks that are different from  or possibly greater than  the risks we are exposed to domestically 
we currently have facilities in eight countries outside the united states and sell products in a number of others 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations 
these operations are subject to a variety of risks that are in addition to the risks that we face domestically or are similar risks but with potentially greater exposure 
these risks include changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  affecting our import and export activities  including export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  and tariff changes  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in  or expiration of  various foreign incentives that provide economic benefits to us  changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in foreign countries  fluctuations of foreign currency  exchange controls and currency devaluations  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  potential political and economic instability and changes in governments  terrorist or military actions that result in destruction or seizure of our assets or suspension or disruption of our operations or those of our customers  potential regulatory changes  including foreign environmental restrictions  and different general economic conditions 
because we have operations in brazil  canada  mexico and europe  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of currencies using various derivative instruments 
however  we may not be able to mitigate all foreign currency related risk 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when translated into us dollars 
developing economies  such as brazil  could have sudden and drastic changes in foreign exchange rates compared to others 
in addition  in foreign markets we are more dependent upon third party providers of key services  such as third party freight forwarders and third party warehouses in europe and latin america 
adverse changes in any of these third party services could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as we expand our international operations  we expect these risks to increase 
in addition  the value of our equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when we initially invested 

table of contents 
index to financial statements brazilian operations we face special political  economic and regulatory risks by doing business in brazil  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of our april acquisition of all of the shares of cdc  we have substantial operations in brazil and face risks related to that country s complex tax  labor  trade compliance and consumer protection laws and regulations 
we may now have exposure to the complex tax structure in brazil  where we have noted that several other companies have had issues with brazilian tax authorities that have impacted earnings 
additionally  developing markets such as brazil have greater political volatility  greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and are more likely than developed economies to experience market  currency and interest rate fluctuations and may have higher inflation 
any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in developing markets it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us  such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local anti bribery laws 
these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees  contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  competition in developing markets such as brazil is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations 
our success in integrating cdc s operations is critical to our growth strategy 
if we cannot successfully increase our business in brazil  our product sales  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
systems and the transition to a new enterprise resource planning system our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon information and communication systems 
a failure of these systems or the erp implementation could disrupt our business 
we are highly dependent upon a variety of internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate our business  including our enterprise resource planning erp systems 
in order to continue support of our growth  we are making significant technological upgrades to our information systems 
we are in the process of implementing a company wide  single erp software system and related processes to perform various functions and improve on the efficiency of our global business 
this is a lengthy and expensive process that will result in a diversion of resources from other operations 
continued execution of the project plan  or a divergence from it  may result in cost overruns  project delays or business interruptions 
in addition  divergence from our project plan could impact the timing and or extent of benefits we expect to achieve from the system and process efficiencies 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and or implementation of the new erp system  or in the performance of our legacy systems  particularly any disruptions  delays or deficiencies that impact our operations  could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business and potentially for our customers to access our price and product availability information 
further  as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information  even for a short period of time 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations  which could adversely affect our reputation  competitive position  business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the information systems of companies we acquire may not be sufficient to meet our standards or we may not be able to successfully convert them to provide acceptable information on a timely and cost effective basis 
furthermore  we must attract and retain qualified people to operate our systems  expand and improve them  integrate new programs effectively with our existing programs  and convert to new systems efficiently when required 
any disruption to our business due to such issues  or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated  could have an adverse affect on our financial results and operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our customers rely increasingly on our electronic ordering and information systems as a source for product information  including availability and pricing 
there can be no assurance that our systems will not fail or experience disruptions  and any significant failure or disruption of these systems could prevent us from making sales  ordering and delivering products and otherwise conducting our business 
many of our customers use our website to check real time product availability  see their customized pricing and place orders 
the internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns 
in addition  some websites have experienced security breakdowns 
while our website has not experienced any material disruptions or security breakdowns  any disruptions or breaches in security or a breach that compromises sensitive information could harm our relationship with our vendors  customers and other business partners 
any material disruption of our website or the internet in general could impair our order processing or prevent our vendors and customers from accessing information and cause us to lose business 
additional costs  cost overruns and delays with implementation of new erp system significant additional costs  cost overruns and delays in connection with the implementation of our new erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the implementation of our new erp system has and will continue to involve substantial expenditures on system hardware and software  as well as design  development and implementation activities 
we have experienced cost overruns and project delays in connection with the implementation process 
until the new erp system is fully implemented  we expect to incur additional selling  general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures to implement and test the system  and there can be no assurance that other issues relating to the erp system will not occur or be identified 
our business and results of operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected if we experience operating problems  additional costs  or cost overruns during the erp implementation process  or if the erp system and the associated process change significantly 
people the departure  transition or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact results of our operations 
if we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees  our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover  or increased salary and benefit costs 
like most businesses  our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management  sales  it  operational  finance and administrative personnel 
we have built our business on a set of core values  and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values 
we want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our vendors and customers 
in order to compete and to continue to grow  we must attract  retain  and motivate employees  including those in executive  senior management  sales  marketing  logistics  technical support and other operating positions 
many of our employees work in small teams to provide specific services to vendors and customers 
they are trained to develop their knowledge of vendor products  programs and practices  and customer business needs  as well as to enhance the skills required to provide exceptional service and to manage our business 
as they gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills  our employees become highly desired by other businesses 
therefore  to retain our employees  we have to provide a satisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits 
if our costs to retain our skilled employees increase  then our business and financial results may be negatively affected 
our continued growth is also dependent  in part  on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management  including but not limited to  michael baur  our chief executive officer 
we may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees 
while we have entered into employment agreements with key executives and have obtained a key person life insurance policy on our ceo s life  the loss of the services of mr 
baur or any member of our senior management team could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent departures  retirement announcements and promotions of senior management has resulted in the transition of many management positions within our company 
the process of identifying management successors creates uncertainty and could become a distraction to our senior management and the board 
we may not be successful in attracting qualified candidates to replace key positions when necessary 
as a result  the transition process and the identification and recruitment of candidates to fill senior management positions may be disruptive to our business or operations 
vendor relationships terminations of a distribution or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms  authorizations  or lack of product availability  or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a significant percentage of our net sales relates to products sold to us by relatively few vendors 
as a result of such concentration risk  terminations of supply or services agreements or a change in terms or conditions of sale from one or more of our vendors could negatively affect our operating margins  revenues or the level of capital required to fund our operations 
our vendors have the ability to make adverse changes in their sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us 
we have no guaranteed price or delivery agreements with our vendors 
in certain product categories  limited price protection or return rights offered by our vendors may have a bearing on the amount of product we may be willing to stock 
our inability to pass through to our reseller customers the impact of these changes  as well as our failure to develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs  could cause us to record inventory write downs or other losses and could have significant negative impact on our gross margins 
we receive purchase discounts and rebates from some vendors based on various factors  including goals for quantitative and qualitative sales or purchase volume and customer related metrics 
certain purchase discounts and rebates may affect gross margins 
many purchase discounts from vendors are based on percentage increases in sales of products 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if these rebates or discounts are reduced or eliminated or if our vendors significantly increase the complexity of process and costs for us to receive such rebates 
our ability to obtain particular products or product lines in the required quantities and our ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis is critical to our success 
our manufacturers have experienced product supply shortages from time to time due to the inability of certain suppliers to supply certain products on a timely basis 
as a result  we have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  short term shortages of specific products 
in addition  vendors who currently distribute their products through us may decide to shift to or substantially increase their existing distribution  through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers or end users 
suppliers have  from time to time  made efforts to reduce the number of distributors with which they do business 
this could result in more intense competition as distributors strive to secure distribution rights with these vendors  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if vendors are not able to provide us with an adequate supply of products to fulfill our customer orders on a timely basis or we cannot otherwise obtain particular products or a product line or vendors substantially increase their existing distribution through other distributors  their own dealer networks  or directly to resellers  our reputation  sales and profitability may suffer 
customer relationships we operate in a highly competitive environment and good customer relations are critical to our success 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and expand our customer relationships or acquire new customers 
meeting our customers needs quickly and fairly is critical to our business success 
our transactions with our customers are generally performed on a purchase order basis rather than under long term supply agreements 
our customers generally do not have an obligation to purchase from us 
therefore  our customers can readily switch their distributors 
from time to time  we experience shortages in availability of some products from vendors  and this impacts our customers decisions regarding whether to make purchases from us 
anything that negatively impacts our customer relations also can negatively impact our operating results 
accordingly  our sales can vary as a result of fluctuations in pricing  product availability  and general competitive and economic conditions 
credit exposure we have credit exposure to our reseller customers 
any adverse trends in their businesses could cause us to suffer credit losses 
we have credit exposure to our reseller customers and negative trends in their businesses could increase our credit risk 
as is customary in our industry  we extend credit to our reseller customers  and most of our sales are on open accounts 
we may be unable to collect on receivables if our reseller customers experience decreases in demand for their products and services  do not manage their businesses adequately  or otherwise become less able to pay due to adverse economic conditions 
as we grow and compete for business  our typical payment terms tend to be longer  and therefore may increase our credit risk 
while we evaluate our resellers qualifications for credit and monitor our extensions of credit  these efforts cannot prevent all credit losses  and credit losses in excess of historical levels would negatively impact our performance 
in addition  for financial reporting purposes we estimate future credit losses and establish an appropriate reserve 
to the extent that our credit losses exceed those reserves  our financial performance will be negatively impacted 
there is no guarantee that our operating expenses will not increase as a result of the recognition of bad debt expense from our reseller customers 
centralized functions we have centralized a number of functions to provide efficient support to our business 
as a result  a loss or reduction of use of one of our locations could have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in order to be as efficient as possible  we centralize a number of critical functions 
for instance  we currently distribute products in north america from a single warehouse near memphis  tennessee with corresponding arrangements for our latin american and european markets 
similarly  we utilize a single information system based in greenville  south carolina for our north american and european operations  while our latin american operations have separate systems 
while we have backup systems and business continuity plans  any significant or lengthy interruption of our ability to provide these centralized functions could significantly impair our ability to continue normal business operations 
in addition  the centralization of these functions increases our exposure to local risks  such as the availability of qualified employees and the lessening of competition for critical services  such as freight and communications 
although we have business interruption insurance  not all losses are covered  and an uninsured loss from electrical or telephone failure  fire or other casualty  or other disruption could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  there are limits on all of our insurance coverage  and it is possible that losses might exceed that coverage 
inventory the value of our inventory may be adversely affected by market and other factors 
our business  like that of other distributors  is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be adversely affected by price reductions by manufacturers or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of our products 
under the terms of most of our vendor agreements and the policy of most manufacturers of specialty technology products  we have some price protection and stock rotation opportunities with respect to slow moving or obsolete inventory items 
however  these protections are limited in scope and do not protect against all declines in inventory value  excess inventory  or product obsolescence  and in some instances we may not be able to fulfill all necessary conditions or successfully manage such price protection or stock rotation opportunities 
in addition  these industry practices are sometimes not reflected in vendor agreements and their application in a particular situation is dependent upon negotiations between our vendors and us 
as a result  from time to time we are required to write down the value of excess and obsolete inventory  and should any of these write downs occur at a significant level  they could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
should we experience an economic downturn  it is possible that prices may decline due to an oversupply of product  and therefore  there may be a greater risk of declines in inventory value 
in addition  our vendors may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their product obligations to us 
significant declines in inventory value in excess of established inventory reserves or dramatic changes in prevailing technologies could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
narrow profit margins our narrow margins significantly impact our operating results 
our industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow gross and operating margins 
as a result  we have significant price competition that results in narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
because these margins are narrow  fluctuations in sales can have a significant impact on our overall operating results 
competition we experience intense competition in all of our markets 
such competition could result in reduced margins and loss of our market share 
the markets that we operate in are highly competitive 
we compete on the basis of price  product availability  speed and accuracy of delivery  effectiveness of sales and marketing programs  credit availability  ability to tailor solutions to the needs of our customers  quality and breadth of product line and services  and availability of technical and product information 
our competitors include regional and national wholesale distributors as well as hardware manufacturers including most of our vendors that sell directly to resellers and to end users 
in addition  we compete with master resellers that sell to franchisees  third party dealers and end users 
certain of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have and may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
certain smaller  regional competitors  who are specialty two tier or mixed model master resellers  may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition has increased for our sales units as broad line and other value added distributors have entered into the specialty technology markets 
such competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of our market share 
as a result of intense price competition in our industry  our gross margins and our operating profit margins have historically been narrow  and we expect them to be narrow in the future 
to remain competitive we may be forced to offer more credit or extended payment terms to our customers 
this could result in an increase in our need for capital  increase our financing costs  increase our bad debt expenses and have a negative impact on our financial results

index to financial statements growth strategies if we fail to effectively manage and implement our organic growth strategies  we may experience a negative effect on our business and financial results 
a significant component of our growth strategy has been to add new vendors and products  and we expect to be able to enter new product markets in the future 
expansion of our existing product markets and entry into new product markets divert the use of our resources and systems  require additional resources that might not be available or available on acceptable terms  result in new or more intense competition  may require longer implementation times or greater start up expenditures than anticipated  and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion  if at all 
in addition  while we have been very successful in adding new vendors in the past  we already represent most of the significant vendors in our primary areas of focus  and there is regular consolidation among our vendors 
as a result  there may be fewer expansion opportunities of this nature in the future 
if we are unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost effective manner  then our revenues may not grow 
our ability to successfully manage our growth will require continued enhancement of our operational  managerial  and financial resources and controls 
our failure to effectively manage our growth could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
additionally  our growth may increase our working capital requirements and as a result  we may require additional equity or debt financing 
such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
acquisitions our growth strategy includes potential acquisitions of companies that complement or expand our existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
we have and expect to continue to acquire companies that complement or expand our business in the united states or internationally 
acquisitions may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management s attention away from normal business operations  sufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the acquisition  difficulty in the integration of acquired businesses  including new employees  business systems and technology  inability to adapt to challenges of new markets  including geographies  products and services  or to attract new sources of profitable business from expansion of products or services  exposure to new regulations  and issues not discovered in our due diligence process 
our operations may be adversely impacted by an acquisition that i is not suited for us  ii is improperly executed  or iii substantially increases our debt 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources market factors may increase the cost and availability of capital 
additional capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs and growth 
our business requires significant levels of capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors 
we have an increased demand for capital when our business is expanding  including through acquisitions 
changes in payment terms with either suppliers or customers could increase our capital requirements 
we have historically relied upon cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  secured and unsecured borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under a subsidiary s line of credit to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth 
while we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will provide sufficient resources to meet our current working capital and cash requirements  if we require an increase in capital to meet our future business needs  such capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
changes in how lenders rate our credit worthiness  as well as macroeconomic factors such as the current economic downturn and global economic instability may restrict our ability to raise capital in adequate amounts or on terms acceptable to us  and the failure to do so could harm our ability to operate our business 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents are deposited with various financial institutions located in the various countries in which we operate 
we endeavor to monitor these financial institutions regularly for credit quality  however  we are exposed to risk of loss on such funds or we may experience significant disruptions in our liquidity needs if one or more of these financial institutions were to suffer bankruptcy or similar restructuring 
terrorist or military operations future terrorist or military operations could result in a disruption of our operation or loss of assets in certain markets 
future terrorist or military actions  in the united states or abroad  could result in destruction or seizure of assets or suspension or disruption of our operations 
additionally  such actions could affect the operations of our suppliers or customers  resulting in loss of access to products  potential losses on supplier programs  loss of business  higher losses on receivables or inventory  and or other disruptions in our business  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we do not carry broad insurance covering such terrorist or military actions  and even if we were to seek such coverage  the cost would likely be prohibitive

furthermore  the loss  disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our businesses  operating results and financial condition 
third party logistics and warehousing providers we use third party logistics and warehousing providers in certain parts of the world that may expose us to risks or liabilities based on their execution that may adversely affect our business operations or financial results 
in europe and brazil  we use third parties to provide warehousing and logistics services in order to provide cost effective operations and scale in certain regions 
the failure or inability of one or more of these third parties to deliver products from suppliers to us or products from us to our customers could disrupt our business and harm our reputation and operating results 
we work closely with our third party logistics and warehousing providers to anticipate issues  and also review public information regarding their financial health 
additionally  deterioration of the financial condition of our logistical and warehousing providers could have an adverse impact on our logistical processes 
poor financial condition of these providers could result in delayed responsiveness or delivery failure  which would ultimately affect our responsiveness to our customers

fair value measurement of contingent consideration  goodwill and other intangible assets changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value could have a significant effect on our reported earnings 
the acquisition of cdc was structured having an upfront payment with five annual cash installments based upon the financial performance of cdc for the twelve month periods ended on june  through june  in accordance with asc  business combinations  a liability for the contingent consideration driven by an earn out must be recorded at the on set of the purchase and must be revalued at every reporting period 
changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
these changes can occur due to changes in estimated future financial results  the probabilities of achieving these results and the discount rate reflective of our creditworthiness and market risk premium associated with the brazilian market 
both gains and losses can occur due to changes in these fair value estimates  thus increasing volatility of our earnings 
on at least an annual basis  we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
this includes continuously monitoring events and circumstances that could trigger an impairment test outside of our annual impairment testing date on june of each year 
testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment requires the use of significant estimates and other inputs outside of our control 
if the carrying of goodwill in any of our goodwill reporting units or other intangible assets is determined to exceed their respective fair values  we may be required to record significant impairment charges that would adversely affect our operating results 
accounting rules changes in accounting rules or standards could have a significant adverse affect on our reported earnings 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretations by various governing bodies including the financial accounting standards board  the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the american institute of certified public accountants 
these governing bodies create and interpret appropriate accounting standards 
future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in additional non cash charges and or changes in presentation or disclosure 
a change from current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations our net sales and operating results are dependent on a number of factors 
our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of changes in demand for our products and services  the introduction of new technology  actions by our competitors  changes in vendors prices or price protection policies  changes in vendors business practices or strategies  changes in freight rates  the timing or the addition of operating expenses to support our growth  the timing of major marketing or other service projects  product supply shortages  changes in product mix  and the general economic factors referenced above 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter  which are difficult to accurately forecast in advance 
as a result  our performance in one period may vary significantly from our performance in the preceding quarter  and may differ significantly from our forecast of performance from quarter to quarter 
the impact of these variances may cause volatility in our stock price

each segment is managed around its geographic customer and vendor bases and is supported by its centralized infrastructure  such as warehousing and back office operations as appropriate 
the north american distribution segment markets automatic identification and data capture aidc and point of sale pos products through its scansource pos and barcoding sales unit  voice  data and converged communications equipment through its catalyst telecom sales unit  video conferencing  telephony and communications products through its scansource communications sales unit  and electronic security products and wireless infrastructure products through its scansource security sales unit 
the international distribution segment markets aidc  pos and barcode  communications  and security products through its scansource latin america sales unit  pos and aidc products through its scansource europe sales unit  and communication products through its scansource communications sales unit in europe 
the company was incorporated in south carolina in december and is headquartered in greenville  south carolina 
the company serves north america from a single  centrally located distribution center located in southaven  mississippi  near the fedex hub 
the single warehouse and strong management information system form the cornerstone of the company s cost driven operational strategy 
this strategy has been expanded to latin america and europe 
the company distributes products for many of its key vendors in all of its geographic markets  however certain vendors only allow distribution to specific geographies 
the company s key vendors in its worldwide pos and barcoding sales units include bematech  cisco  datalogic  datamax o neil  elo  epson  honeywell  ibm  intermec  motorola  ncr  toshiba and zebra technologies

table of contents 
index to financial statements our objective is to continue to grow profitable sales in the technologies we distribute 
in doing so  our management team faces numerous challenges that require attention and resources 
certain business units and geographies are experiencing increased competition for the products we distribute 
this competition may come in the form of pricing  credit terms  service levels  product availability and in some cases  changes from a closed distribution sales model  where resellers must purchase exclusively from one distributor  to an open distribution sales model  where resellers may choose to purchase from multiple distributors 
as this competition could affect both our market share and pricing of our products  we may change our strategy in order to effectively compete 
we have continued investing in our international distribution segment  particularly in europe  by temporarily accepting lower than normal returns in the business in an effort to protect existing market share and gain new customers 
in the current year  our results in the international distribution segment were weaker than expected as the markets in europe and latin america seemed to contract and competitive pressures intensified 
while certain international markets are volatile in the current macroeconomic environment  especially parts of europe  we are continuing to invest in this business to position the company favorably against our competitors for the long term 
we are in the process of designing and developing a new enterprise resource planning erp system that is intended to be used globally and provide operational efficiencies 
we have recently received a project assessment from a third party service provider  which indicates that the project will take longer to implement and exceed our previously disclosed cost estimates 
during the year  we have consolidated the warehousing function of our german communications business into our belgian operations 
this consolidation gives us logistical efficiencies and service level advantages such as greater flexibility and scalability 
we have committed funds to brazil to provide for a portion of future contingent consideration payments owed to the former shareholders of cdc and are continuously working to add new vendors and grow existing vendors in our various geographies 
this is our first full year of results with our most recent acquisition  cdc  brazil s leading distributor of aidc and pos solutions 
also  we continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions to enhance our technological and geographic portfolios 
cost control profitability our operating income growth is driven not only by gross profits but by a disciplined control of operating expenses 
our operations feature a scalable information system  streamlined management  and centralized distribution  enabling us to achieve the economies of scale necessary for cost effective order fulfillment 
from inception  we have managed our general and administrative expenses by maintaining strong cost controls 
however  in order to continue to grow in our markets  we have invested in new initiatives  including investments in new geographic markets such as europe and latin america  increased marketing efforts to recruit resellers  and enhanced employee benefit plans to retain employees 
evaluating financial condition and operating performance we place a significant emphasis on operating income and return on invested capital roic in evaluating and monitoring financial condition and operating performance 
we use roic  a non gaap measure  to assess efficiency at allocating capital under our control to generate returns 
we compute roic as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by invested capital 
invested capital is defined as average equity plus daily average funded debt for the period 
the following table summarizes our return on invested capital ratio for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively return on invested capital ratio 
table of contents 
index to financial statements management uses roic as a performance measurement because we believe this metric best balances the company s operating results with asset and liability management  excludes the results of capitalization decisions  is easily computed and understand  and drives changes in shareholder value 
the components of this calculation and reconciliation to the company s financial statements are shown  as follows reconciliation of ebitda to net income fiscal year ended june  in thousands net income plus income taxes plus interest expense plus depreciation amortization ebitda numerator invested capital calculations fiscal year ended june  in thousands equity beginning of the year equity end of the year average equity average funded debt invested capital denominator return on invested capital average funded debt is calculated as the daily average amounts outstanding on our short term and long term interest bearing debt 
our return on invested capital was for the year  down from in the prior year  but up from in fiscal 
the decrease from the prior year is largely due to lower margins arising from mix and competitive pricing pressures and increased headcount and investment in our international segment to sustain market share and existing volumes throughout the current european economic downturn

we have experienced increased competition in the pos and aidc channel in north america in response to market share gains in the previous period 
scansource security continues to deliver strong double digit growth over the prior year  primarily from video surveillance and wireless networking products from vendors such as axis communications and ruckus wireless 
the company has two north american sales units that sell communications products to our customers the catalyst telecom and scansource communications sales units

index to financial statements international distribution gross profit in our international distribution segment increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in gross profit is primarily the result of the impact of having a full year of cdc results  partially offset by the decrease in gross profit generated in europe 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from the prior year 
this is largely the result of increased inventory reserves in europe  coupled with changes to certain vendor programs

operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for the fiscal year ended june   compared to in the prior year 
this increase was mainly attributable to a full year of operating results from the acquisition of cdc  higher compensation expense and incremental expenses related to our erp project that are required to be expensed as incurred 
we have elected to present changes in fair value of the contingent consideration owed to former shareholders of cdc separately from other selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the current year  we have recorded a million loss  driven by changes to forecasted and actual results  offset by recurring amortization of the unrecognized fair value discount

the decrease is attributable to weaker operating results in fiscal year operating margin percentage decreased from the prior year 
in the current year  gross margins are down in europe because of increased inventory reserves and changes to vendor programs  as mentioned above 
additionally  operating expenses are higher as we continue to invest in international markets

the company generates interest income on cash invested in brazil to fund a portion of future earnout payments and to supplement local working capital needs  in addition to longer term interest bearing receivables and  to a lesser extent  interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re measurements  offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses 
foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the british pound versus the euro  the us dollar versus the euro  the us dollar versus the brazilian real and other currencies versus us dollar 
for fiscal  the majority of losses were associated with exposures between the us dollar and brazilian real

the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market  and vendor incentives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note  business and summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized once four criteria are met the company must have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must occur this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain  the price must be fixed and determinable  and collectability must be reasonably assured 
the company allows its customers to return product for exchange or credit subject to certain limitations 
a provision for estimated losses on returns is recorded based on historical experience 

table of contents 
index to financial statements service revenue associated with configuration and marketing services is recognized when the work is complete and the four criteria discussed above have been substantially met 
we also distribute third party service contracts  typically for product maintenance and support 
since we act as an agent on behalf of most of these service contracts sold  revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale 
however  we distribute some self branded warranty programs and engage a third party generally the original equipment manufacturer to cover the fulfillment of any obligations arising from these contracts 
these revenues and associated third party costs are amortized over the life of contract and presented in net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
other miscellaneous service revenue associated with configuration  marketing  service contracts and other services has approximated or less of consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and during the fiscal years ended june   and  the company has not engaged in any sales transactions involving multiple element arrangements 
had any arrangements with multiple deliverables occurred  we would follow the guidance set forth in accounting standards codification asc allowances for trade and notes receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the company 
management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
a provision for estimated returns and allowances and associated losses is recorded and based on historical experience 
inventory reserves management determines the inventory reserves required to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market based principally on the effects of technological changes  quantities of goods on hand  and other factors 
an estimate is made of the market value  less cost to dispose  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
the estimates used to calculate these reserves are applied consistently 
the adjustments are recorded in the period in which the loss of utility of the inventory occurs  which establishes a new cost basis for the inventory 
this new cost basis is maintained until such time that the reserved inventory is disposed of  returned to the vendor or sold 
to the extent that specifically reserved inventory is sold  cost of goods sold is expensed for the new cost basis of the inventory sold 
vendor programs the company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors 
some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed between the company and the vendor 
vendors generally require that we use their cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
incentives received from vendors for specifically identified incremental cooperative advertising programs are recorded as adjustments to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the financial accounting standards board s fasb asc revenue recognition  addresses accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
this guidance requires that the portion of these vendor funds in excess of our costs be reflected as a reduction of inventory 
such funds are recognized as a reduction of the cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold 
the company records unrestricted volume rebates received as a reduction of inventory and as a reduction of the cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
amounts received or receivables from vendors that are not yet earned are deferred in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company may receive early payment discounts from certain vendors 
the company records early payment discounts received as a reduction of inventory and recognizes the discount as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
asc requires management to make certain estimates of the amounts of vendor incentives that will be received 
actual recognition of the vendor consideration may vary from management estimates based on actual results

index to financial statements share based payments the company accounts for share based compensation using the provisions of asc  accounting for stock compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
share based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards  in accordance with the provisions of asc since this compensation cost is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company has elected to expense grants of awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
federal income taxes are not assessed on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it has been the practice of the company to reinvest those earnings in the business outside the united states

business combinations the company accounts for business combinations in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
asc establishes principles and requirements for recognizing the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired target in a business combination 
asc also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate and understand the financial impact of the business combination 
see note  acquisitions for further discussion 
goodwill the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at a reporting unit level at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
our goodwill reporting units are our north america segment and  in our international segment  various components one level below 
the goodwill testing utilizes a two step impairment analysis  whereby the company compares the carrying value of each identified reporting unit to its fair value 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using the net present value of discounted cash flows generated by each reporting unit 
considerable judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors affecting the estimated fair value of the reporting units  including the operating and macroeconomic factors 
historical financial information  internal plans and projections  and industry information are used in making such estimates 
in the two step impairment analysis  goodwill is first tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit s carrying amount to identify any potential impairment 
if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value  a second step is used whereby the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined through a hypothetical purchase price allocation  is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings for the difference 
we also assess the recoverability of goodwill if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
in our most recent annual test  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method required us to estimate future cash flows and discount those amounts to a present value 
the key assumptions utilized in determining fair value included industry weighted average cost of capital wacc we utilized a wacc relative to each reporting unit s respective geography and industry as the discount rate for estimated future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market place participant in each respective geography 
operating income we utilized historical and expected revenue growth rates  gross margins and operating expense percentages  which varied based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated 

table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flows from working capital changes we utilized a projected cash flow impact pertaining to expected changes in working capital as each of our goodwill reporting units grow 
while we believe our assumptions are appropriate  they are subject to uncertainty and by nature include judgments and estimates regarding future events  including projected growth rates  margin percentage and operating efficiencies 
during fiscal years  and  no impairment charges related to goodwill were recorded 
however  as of the latest annual goodwill impairment test  the estimated fair value of our brazilian goodwill reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a smaller margin than the company s other goodwill reporting units 
our brazilian operations were only recently acquired  resulting in a carrying value that approximates its fair value 
the carrying value of our brazilian goodwill asset as of june  was million 
the estimated fair value of our brazilian goodwill reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by in the most recent annual impairment test 
the increase in sensitivity to our brazilian goodwill reporting unit is driven largely by the general macroeconomic environment and lower expectations for future results in this unit 
key assumptions used in determining fair value include projected growth and operating margin  working capital requirements and discount rates 
while we do not believe that this goodwill reporting unit is impaired at this time  if we are not able to achieve projected operating margins within the expected working capital requirements and or there are unfavorable changes to the discount rate  a future impairment of goodwill is at least reasonably possible 
liability for contingent consideration in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to former cdc shareholders  the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on future results through fiscal year based on a multiple of the subsidiary s pro forma net income as defined in exhibit b of the share purchase and sale agreement 
future payments are to be paid in brazilian currency  the real 
there are four remaining earnout payments payable in annual installments on august  with the final payment on october  in accordance with asc topic  the company determines the fair value of this liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date throughout the term of the earnout using a discounted cash flow model following the income approach 
each period the company will reflect the contingent consideration liability at fair value with changes recorded in the change in fair value of contingent consideration line item on the consolidated income statement 
current and noncurrent portions of the liability are presented in the current portion of contingent consideration and long term portion of contingent consideration line items on the consolidated balance sheet 
accounting standards recently issued see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  industrial revenue bond and borrowings under the european subsidiary s million line of credit 
as a distribution company  our business requires significant investment in working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventory  partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors and revolving lines of credit 
overall  as our sales volumes increase our net investment in working capital typically increases  which in general results in decreased cash flow from operating activities 
conversely  when sales volumes decrease  our net investment in working capital typically decreases  which in general  results in increased cash flow from operating activities 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june   of which million and million was held outside of the united states as of june  and  respectively 
there has been a significant increase in cash held outside of the united states due to a million cash transfer to our brazilian subsidiary to provide for a portion of future earnout payments to the former shareholders of cdc 
we transferred the cash in september to our brazilian subsidiary in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk and supplement our working capital needs in brazil 
cash balances are generated and used in many locations throughout the world 
management s intent is to permanently reinvest these funds in our businesses outside the united states to continue to fund growth in our international operations 
furthermore  our current plans do not require repatriation of funds from our international operations to fund operations in the united states 
if these funds were needed in the operations of the united states  we would be required to record and pay significant income taxes upon repatriation of these funds 
see note  income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

inventory turnover decreased to times during the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year versus times in the comparative prior year period 
this decrease in turns was largely the function of higher inventory levels built up throughout fiscal  as a result of favorable vendor pricing  longer lead times and anticipation for demand in certain products 
beginning in the third quarter of the current fiscal year  management initiated a global plan to reduce inventories to levels more consistent with our current volumes and weaker growth in europe

a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility  variable rate long term debt and subsidiary line of credit for the fiscal year ended june  would have resulted in a million increase or decrease  respectively  in pre tax income for the period 
the company evaluates its interest rate risk and may use interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt 
at june   the company had million in variable rate long term debt outstanding with no interest rate swaps in place 
if used  derivative instruments have the potential to expose the company to certain market risks including the possibility of the company s hedging activities not being as effective as anticipated in reducing the volatility of the company s cash flows  the counterparty not performing its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement  the hedging arrangement being imperfect or ineffective  or the terms of the swap or associated debt may change 
the company seeks to lessen such risks by having established a policy to identify  control  and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  as well as limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions

these risks include transactions denominated in non functional currencies and intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries 
in the normal course of the business  foreign exchange risk is managed by the use of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge these exposures as well as balance sheet netting of exposures 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations may cause our international results to fluctuate significantly when translated into us dollars 
these risks may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company s board of directors has approved a foreign exchange hedging policy to reduce foreign currency exposure 
the company s policy is to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company monitors its risk associated with the volatility of certain foreign currencies against its functional currencies and enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to minimize short term currency risks on cash flows 
these positions are based upon balance sheet exposures and  in certain foreign currencies  our forecasted purchases and sales 
the company continually evaluates foreign exchange risk and may enter into foreign exchange transactions in accordance with its policy 
actual variances from these forecasted transactions can adversely impact foreign exchange results 
foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense income 
the company has elected not to designate its foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and therefore  the instruments are marked to market with changes in their values recorded in the consolidated income statement each period
